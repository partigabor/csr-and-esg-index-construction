thank sir
ladies gentleman time will begin question answer_session
operator_instruction
[ner:ordinal] question_come [ner:person]_[ner:organization]
please go_ahead
good_morning guy
fabulous_quarter
thanks [ner:person]
difference increase revenue increase margin [ner:ordinal] party increase cost
tell [ner:date] cost_increase
[ner:person] want handle
sure think table [ner:person] sorry [ner:location] [ner:date]
come listen [ner:person]
go try give religion
[ner:money] [ner:duration] round number increase revenue per [ner:duration] [ner:money] increase cost per [ner:duration] cost increase cost
combination factor
know [ner:set] rig_report experience fair amount rain [ner:date] mean crew sit wait move
recall [ner:number] rig [ner:date] several rig [ner:date]
would [ner:number] factor another labor_cost go term way schedule people enough people work increase rig
would primary thing
move mobilization_cost rig [ner:money] [ner:money] will help offset go_forward weather talk price_increase impact fall income_statement
could give beginning question sure yes use charge [ner:money] mob [ner:money] move
depend far move [ner:person]
go double price move
yes pretty much raise [ner:duration] [ner:number] [ner:number] [ner:number] like say good quarter_guy
curious know [ner:date] go
curious as_to revenue business guess [ner:person] trucking_side
trucking well need truck
because_of shortage truck rig wait truck area time try help problem add additional truck take time a_lot_of money
reason go_up [ner:date] charge move new tandem time get field [ner:money] get pay stuff
get wrong
take rig
price go
[ner:person] question location trucking part average revenue per [ner:duration]
[ner:date] charge contract average revenue per [ner:duration] report
effect disconnect relate trucking item reimbursable customer difference primarily mobilization_cost
help know margin least know probably keep pace
[ner:number] competitor announce conference_call [ner:date] payroll_tax property_tax would expect [ner:duration] would still increase significantly cost may go_up [ner:money] [ner:money] [ner:duration] [ner:date]
guy see business
estimate impact fica occur [ner:date] like [ner:money] [ner:money]
[ner:date] aware would kind impact
hand think cost per [ner:duration] will go quarter quarter [ner:ordinal]
think guess cost per [ner:duration] will similar [ner:date] additional increase would likely relate field_payroll occur think could pass along higher [ner:duration]
effect guess [ner:person] comment average revenue per [ner:duration] go_on [ner:money] would think increase effect would drop bottom as_to increase margin
okay gentleman appreciate
will let people ask
thank
next_question_come [ner:person] please go_ahead
good_morning
hi [ner:person]
selection finally arrive
think
hear correctly say bulk [ner:money] [ner:duration] [ner:date] drop bottom line
would guess
thanks
know question
look like market finally come around
term use cash raise dividend institute [ner:number] [ner:date]
dividend_versus_share_repurchase guy decision
[ner:person] actively consider regular [ner:set] basis board
know buyback place
buyback institute opportunistic structured reduction capital certainly discussion board something will consider [ner:date] progress
move forward [ner:date] drop [ner:misc] rig_activity would image impact pressure margin sequentially
think [ner:location] strong enough [ner:date] offset completely seasonal drop [ner:location] would expect margin come_down sequentially [ner:date] versus [ner:ordinal]
think would expect necessarily go rate increase would expect drop
[ner:location] contribute [ner:money] [ner:duration] overall margin get [ner:date] effect become kind non-player rig run
otherwise think know [ner:ordinal] [ner:date] expect [ner:money] [ner:duration] increase [ner:location] [ner:misc] impact would kind mute pull back [ner:money] course get [ner:date] [ner:misc] rig_activity go get lot back
effect guess would think margin would go_up [ner:ordinal] [ner:date] less would [ner:location]
understood
term say go activate [ner:number] rig [ner:duration] long demand_warrant
understand correctly

market_share go_up vis--vis say neighbor neighbor activate rig pace
work
think [ner:number] player really significant capacity ability understand neighbor
know
know anybody else know understand neighbor as_well [ner:number] player
context capex [ner:date]
capex [ner:date] know clearly dependent demand customer know look [ner:set]
look [ner:date] point thought [ner:date] bring_out [ner:number] additional rig total include business [ner:organization] pressure_pump etc. would [ner:money]
[ner:money] like [ner:money] run_rate [ner:date]
guess would depend demand could increase
lastly stock_option_expense
could give update go happen guy [ner:ordinal] half [ner:date]
yes look far accountant seem focus matter [ner:date] estimate impact [ner:money] per share [ner:date]
obviously will occur back half [ner:date]
know calculation drive option vest board really back [ner:date] [ner:date] even larger scale_effect move stock_option restricted stock see kind [ner:set] g&a_number higher time_period drive partly impact expense restricted stock
therefore little overhang point related employee_stock_option
look [ner:date] would guess [ner:date] would [ner:money] per share
okay lastly re-activization_cost rig bring_it_out cost per rig kind cost per rig look
[ner:money] include drill_strength
continue increase fairly steady state
pretty steady versus [ner:date] drill_strength etc.
much drill_pipe need
will get back food_chain will call food_chain drill_pipe go order [ner:number] joint [ner:duration]
activation rig replacement real strength wear_out number rig run
excellent
thanks lot guy
thank [ner:person]
thank next_question_come [ner:location] [ner:organization]
please go_ahead
good_morning
[ner:person] wonder could give insight see [ner:location] [ner:location] south [ner:location] term activity rate
see everywhere tremendous demand equipment
matter area pick say [ner:date] continue increase point never see demand like
[ner:date] think lot a_lot_of area change major oil_company larger independent oil_company buy know buy production development_opportunity [ner:location] [ner:location] [ner:location]
everywhere
never see demand equipment exist [ner:date] think lot higher commodity_price
think people get comfortable high commodity_price believe go stay probably sensitivity run economics get little higher so_that make know prospects viable drill higher budget see tremendous demand every area
[ner:duration] old rig plan reactivate [ner:date] particular market think will move rig a_kind_of across board everywhere
think salesman say fight internally rig every area want rig east_[ner:location] [ner:location] [ner:location] particularly [ner:location] [ner:location] need rig pretty much split
will move [ner:location] [ner:location] couple think list area project [ner:date] certainly could change [ner:date] go depend greatest demand
okay
[ner:ordinal] question pressure_pump
larger least least expect seasonal decline job margin
[ner:date] generate [ner:percent] return capital bad wonder see side business
well sort see decline see a_couple_of thing attribute part demand still
a_kind_of warm [ner:date] get muddy road [ner:location] truly difficult move [ner:location]
another thing see [ner:date] price gas go high nobody want stop anything hunting_season holiday think people accustomed higher price
think go probably back normal activity [ner:location] shutdown hunting_season holiday [ner:duration]
go back normal activity
okay last question
capex_plan [ner:date] indication
say earlier
look kind quarter quarter
thing change business demand could go guess [ner:date] would [ner:money] business include reactivation [ner:number] rig will readdress [ner:date]
okay thanks guy
appreciate
thanks_henrion
next_question_come [ner:person] [ner:person]
please go_ahead
good_morning guy
nice quarter
a_couple_of question talk rig_reactivation_program
usual run [ner:number] rig [ner:date] plan_up put_out [ner:number] [ner:duration] may rig [ner:person] [ner:person] think guy stack will fall [ner:money] rig_category beyond rest rig
[ner:person] think continue kind measure approach [ner:duration] bring_out kind [ner:number] rig think could next [ner:number] rig high quality significant horsepower_rig
go get many specifics competitive reason really first-class rig perfectly situate perfectly suitable activity_level market fact see [ner:duration] without hesitancy whatsoever maybe even accelerate rate depend course market offer
assurance see go say [ner:number] feel like run close [ner:number] rig point give point see account [ner:number] [ner:number] see rig repair weather all_of kind thing really hard effect_measure
[ner:number] plus effect [ner:number] additional [ner:date] [ner:number] additional [ner:date] put we_kind [ner:number] level
rig could bring market really go_out look [ner:date] say next [ner:number]
[ner:number] thing would observe [ner:person] kind way world work tight rig_market_customer find accept rig might say would accept
will take [ner:number] horsepower [ner:date] say could job [ner:date] horsepower
real interesting thing move target effect number rig market will absorb give point
highly confident effect next say [ner:number]
right
business_nobody talk drilling completion fluid obviously offshore activity globe_lease certainly strengthen deep water_activity strengthen
business seem strengthen outlook business [ner:date]
internally really assume continue run_rate [ner:ordinal] [ner:date]
kind margin everything
yes kind revenue
clear [ner:person] though gulf go business
last [ner:number] housekeeping question
sg [ner:date] [ner:date] kick_up obviously key whatever increment get key rig [ner:date] kind run_rate think g&a
guess would similar [ner:date] [ner:ordinal] around [ner:money] mention earlier move restricted stock impact g&a_number [ner:date] maybe [ner:number] bump_up [ner:money] [ner:date] [ner:date] somewhere around [ner:money]
guess [ner:date] will somewhere around [ner:money]
right finally tax_rate_assumption [ner:date]
would use [ner:percent] see [ner:date] actually [ner:date] come little may occur [ner:date] purpose modeling price [ner:percent] indiscernible
great
thanks_guy
thank
next_question [ner:person]_[ner:organization]
please go_ahead
thanks much
clarify comment make [ner:number] rig [ner:person] number actual individual unit active [ner:date]
give example [ner:person] [ner:set] rig_count could volatile due move weather thing [ner:person] mention
know last even [ner:date] [ner:duration] see rig_count individual [ner:duration] [ner:number] range think ever [ner:duration] run
guess would [ner:date] [ner:number] active give take [ner:number]
okay know average rig_count [ner:date] give [ner:duration] actually something order [ner:date] [ner:number] unit work recent [ner:date]
yes [ner:date]
[ner:number] rig crew
exactly look
okay
come back revenue per [ner:duration] want understand [ner:person] talk [ner:date] [ner:money] increase [ner:location] set [ner:money] miss [ner:location]
want make sure misinterpret comment
expect rate [ner:location] moderate get [ner:date] [ner:date]
actually intend example
[ner:date] really try look_out [ner:duration] feel like decent visibility far leave analyst draw conclusion [ner:duration] beyond
example assume [ner:money] [ner:location] [ner:misc] utilization drop_off would effect offset some_of benefit bring back [ner:money]
case think rate would move [ner:money] [ner:location] [ner:date] think would ultimately put would [ner:money] because_of [ner:misc] impact
mean suggest margin quarter
want ask question
let take_off
see revenue per [ner:duration] [ner:money] [ner:date]
give projection [ner:money] [ner:date]
[ner:person] say hard-pressed think reason would slow_down
think go slow_down
certainly see demand get equipment would certainly would anticipate [ner:date] increase will lend fleet show increase know go_up [ner:date] go job job point time_contract move target
[ner:person] factor course know cost [ner:percent] market [ner:percent] market control competition give [ner:duration] [ner:duration] affect as_well
tell see term demand necessarily clear pricing
yes understand point_out nobody else spare capacity really [ner:number] major party significant capacity think really
thanks_[ner:person]
thank
next_question_come [ner:person] [ner:person] company
please go_ahead
good_morning
walk amount report active rig [ner:date] [ner:date] date reflect [ner:number] active rig key_acquisition
yes
mean [ner:number] include partial contribution point
well certainly market
look [ner:date] see many average key_rig run
give [ner:duration] somewhere around [ner:number]
know [ner:date] patterson-uti_growth [ner:location] [ner:number] [ner:number] [ner:number] [ner:misc] contribute believe [ner:number] [ner:number]
frankly look [ner:date]
[ner:date] rig market people work contract_rate method relevant [ner:date] happen look [ner:date] could help
see significant sort divergence cash_margin term way rig influence overall cash_margin q1 sort progress negotiated project q2 might change see significant overall cash_margin
think will significant move_they_up call [ner:person]
certainly finish contract key make little less normally would charge certain area think will see switch know equal charge customer area
ahead quickly right
certainly will start happen [ner:date] basically would [ner:date] like rig
[ner:person] go impact [ner:date] effect average will muted somewhat exist contract take_over complete
think mute will continue [ner:date]
got finally [ner:number] remain rig include active count key include sort pool [ner:number] talk reactivatable around [ner:money]
pool
[ner:number] total rig rig identify activate
none happen [ner:number]
[ner:number] might reactivate know mark indicate earlier look base_on demand market [ner:date] activate rig
make sense
yes part rig people get hand around handle along get rig put_they_out none rig project come_out [ner:date] none [ner:number] key_stack_rig
okay
thank guy
[ner:person] question
yes next_question [ner:person]_[ner:organization]
please go_ahead
good morning_everybody
clearly demand exceed supply rest [ner:date]
question little_bit supply_side_response discuss availability bring_out competitor
perspective supply spare capacity out_of neighbor stack rig timing and/or economics
would kind get thought [ner:person] best person address
will happy talk little_bit
certainly see economics build new rig point
maybe [ner:duration] will
itis certainly radar_screen yet anywhere close long bring_out rig [ner:money] range new one cost [ner:money] get field think would competitive thing foreseeable [ner:date]
certainly could change
far rig come out_of marketplace certainly will scattered rig will insignificant number comparison overall number rig work [ner:location] [ner:date]
okay
[ner:person] maybe gut feel question mention customer see price commodity opportunity
sense mix_change risk_profile drill i.e. shift away_from development exploration mix
think mix fact would think would development_drilling exploration_drilling believe commodity_price go continue stay high
know see rig run oil_field see rig run [ner:duration]
think know oil place drill smaller spacing get [ner:money] barrel oil become economics
see lot go particularly [ner:location] think go still need development unbelievable become economic drill higher [ner:money] gas higher [ner:money] will
got
last [ner:number] around efficiency
throughout period maybe slower response efficiency_gain efficiency mod_improvement rig_efficiency move etc.
see look crystal_ball efficiency
think get efficient category rig [ner:date] think way [ner:misc] drilling_contractor respond long continuous turn start [ner:date]
allow continue far efficient last upturn mention big technology change allow drill area go thousand_of well drill faster drill customer economics less barrel take pay higher commodity_price
got create opportunity
exactly
good
rest answer
appreciate will turn back guy
thank
next_question_come [ner:person] ph [ner:organization] please go_ahead
thank
good_morning
pretty_much_everything ask
[ner:number] quick modeling_question
run_rate d&a [ner:set] basis
depreciation
[ner:date] would guess somewhere around [ner:money] factor capex_estimate [ner:date] would take_it_up [ner:date] progress would guess additional rig activate
[ner:date] somewhere maybe [ner:money] range
great
thanks
thank
next_question_come [ner:organization]
please go_ahead
good_morning guy
good_morning
quick question
look average_margin hit back [ner:date] closer [ner:money]
see
see get back level [ner:date]
see [ner:date] exceed number
head
tend look_out beyond [ner:date]
base upon say far [ner:date] would put somewhere [ner:money] [ner:duration]
peak margin [ner:number] last time [ner:money] [ner:money]
dramatically so_if demand continue pricing continue move could eclipse [ner:date]
think view whether will happen point time
thing look pretty strong guess [ner:location]
look [ner:misc] side_thing run extremely strong [ner:duration] half [ner:duration] obviously peak level [ner:date]
look expansion [ner:location] keep fleet
think will always consider opportunity incremental rig [ner:location] frankly
issue always [ner:duration] think will give superior return shareholder
obviously appreciate fact [ner:date] margin point ahead [ner:location] course take slight discount fact seasonality [ner:misc] operation true [ner:location] term break-up_period
always make evaluation consider whether move incremental rig [ner:location]
know put additional rig [ner:date] would certainly consider
much would like say subject
guess another issue creep_up rig_count start push [ner:number] [ner:number] [ner:location] people_issue
[ner:location] tough area get people
hit wall
guess [ner:number] rig come_out
look staffing_level [ner:date] see hit barrier
well know think will hit barrier
think take time train think different turn slow methodology_way rig_count [ner:duration] turn look like may go visibility far would surprise go several [ner:duration] give time train people a_lot_of people young guy exactly right [ner:location] difficult place think industry [ner:location] decimate [ner:date] [ner:date] build back
take time think correct way slow methodical trend put rig go
see hurdle
basically rig plan come_out staffing follow suit
count look way look go [ner:number] rig [ner:number] rig big hurdle effect doubling business point incremental effect [ner:percent] increase rig much much easier accomplish already
really pleased grow fleet time overall efficiency fleet
drill area faster [ner:date] start [ner:date]
think real well maintain efficiency know difficult a_lot_of place service_business [ner:duration] labor_have_always_be_the_biggest_single_problem hard problem slow hard problem a_lot_of rig
always work
think big issue
okay great guy
thanks
appreciate
next_question follow-up question [ner:person]
please go_ahead
mr._holly
look like may step away_from phone will go next_question follow-up question [ner:person]
please
[ner:person] want come back visibility
mention great visibility [ner:date] wonder could characterize conversation customer
start conversation potential work greater time horizon say [ner:number] [ner:date]
yes think fair statement discuss
term_contract make
make term_contract yet
certainly say go
ask term_contract
guess say visibility never see downturn indiscernible lead commodity_price_downturn believe commodity_price go stay oil [ner:money] [ner:money] barrel gas_between_[ner:money] [ner:money] [ner:money] think go see long trend continue visibility far see commodity_price go anybody guess
[ner:date] pretty apparent might cross supply-demand curve crude oil world case good crude oil_perspective also good natural gas_perspective [ner:location] point go crack crude oil_price natural gas
decoupling [ner:date] natural gas_price kind go away value [ner:number] ratio crude oil
think see return industry
crude oil short world guess reach close_to capacity able produce like natural gas [ner:location] [ner:date]
case know yet think could see long long trend high commodity_price
could discuss little_bit think term
mean rate go_up seem little incentive start lock_in think
would condition would start consider go term_commitment
get answer want make [ner:number] clarify comment
think [ner:person] speak [ner:number] commodity recouple necessarily say would [ner:number] ratio use
try suggest specific couple ratio may come back couple
clarification
[ner:ordinal] go back term_contract_question thought subject get point customer think achieve contract perspective give both_of kind proper upside return will consider
factor course consider competition operate business competitive vacuum
look competitive marketplace make judgment
[ner:date] see term_contract yet offer level think would appropriate take contract put aside question enforceability
right
simplistic think term margin per rig_[ner:duration] know guess margin per rig_[ner:duration] start become interesting
think complicated question
let give a_couple_of particulars
[ner:duration] get pay
bear responsibility delay
bear responsibility kind delay
play weather
play repair
whole series look kind like binomial problem actually larger problem binomial
last question really kind education get people add staff
come out_of workforce
try people always way [ner:number] thing happen upturn industry increase unemployment [ner:location]
remember [ner:date] unemployment lowest [ner:duration] [ner:location] [ner:date] back normal [ner:percent] [ner:percent] draw lower end a_lot_of employee
a_lot_of look work
wages go_up
[ner:date] [ner:percent] wage_increase at_least become competitive [ner:organization] [ner:organization] use competitive
keep wages low low long could compete market_place
[ner:date] kid could come out_of high school work [ner:date] drilling_rig could make enough money go college [ner:duration]
[ner:date] back
make money work drilling_rig anywhere else unskilled laborer
draw market_place
different [ner:duration] [ner:date]
thing wages high enough [ner:date] compete
thanks much

[ner:ordinal] question [ner:person]
mr._[ner:person] may proceed
good afternoon gentleman
nice quarter
could [ner:person] tell balance commercial loan get [ner:money] m_recovery could give little_bit color loan
actually create sorry [ner:person] help
balance [ner:number]
[ner:date] charge_it_down
actually a_series_of real estate_investment feel little uncomfortable fortunately good property course time owner able sell property make whole reason market type property get favorable [ner:date] pleased able book recovery
actually a_series_of property
excellent
doe launch_list_look point
look good awhile
honestly keep knock wood look economy think evidence economy really get stronger see
[ner:duration] delinquency_number [ner:number] basis_point think outlook pretty good
launch list low level relative basis feel good outlook asset_quality time
mean something could jump bite feel pretty good
think testimony strong economy
think testimony underwriting_and_credit_administration_process
sit around table evaluate credit come people acquire credit [ner:date] together awhile
think good experience look
sometimes thing happen beyond control
happen make practice address aggressively early [ner:number] case [ner:date] favorable outcome lose money [ner:number] hotel talk much anticipate could
feel good way a_couple_of problem get resolve
kind follow kind give scrutiny loan_loss_provision get [ner:date] via [ner:date] [ner:organization] auditor forth give decline mpa excellent performance improve condition watch_list give little_bit thought might impact reserve_level [ner:number]
[ner:person] will answer
absolutely right review_process banking_standard also external auditor also [ner:date] [ner:organization] become much rigorous adequacy loan per loan_loss
believe model adequately address risk inherent within portfolio also know take consideration large amount new loan bring portfolio
look back trend asset_quality overall portfolio really change quickly unless type economic shock type breakdown credit_administration
say allowance loan_loss_reserve run fairly steady change moderately time
thing jump mind ask question [ner:person] also mean net charge [ner:date] [ner:date] [ner:number] basis_point mean low number
nobody go sustain kind number_[ner:duration] [ner:duration]
mean look back last [ner:number] [ner:number] [ner:duration] probably go see somewhere [ner:number] [ner:number] [ner:number] basis_point average
probably realistic expectation time net charge_off
good
[ner:person] look though [ner:duration] bring_down level investment_security
think kind want keep point
think may take_it_down
pretty comfortable [ner:date]
want get position borrow short term_fund invest intermediate long term_security leverage tactic
pull_down leverage balance_sheet work_out well [ner:date] yield_curve flatten tactic really strategy get balance_sheet position anticipation see go happen
[ner:number] question will let folk hop
net interest_margin also improve nice improvement [ner:date]
give little_bit feel might think net interest_margin might continue improve throughout [ner:date] [ner:organization] continue increase rate
well course theory balance_sheet continue asset sensitive probably [ner:duration] primarily because_of way commercial lending_customer_preference_shift toward variable rate_loan at_least market
theory short term_rate go_up asset_sensitive_balance_sheet improvement net interest_margin
take consideration flattening yield_curve see provide little dynamic type_scenario
think go combination
short term_rate_increase will help
also depend happen long end curve as_well
answer question
help thank
couple question will come back end ask somebody else
next_question [ner:person]_[ner:organization]
mr._[ner:person] may proceed
[ner:person] hi gentleman
actually s_[ner:person] sit_in [ner:person]
congratulation quarter
a_couple_of quick question with_regard_to fee_side
nice improvement wealth_management_business term fee_income
[ner:percent] growth quarter
describe little_bit drive also sort outlook go_forward term business
also insurance_line_item kind conversely see opposite see decline [ner:percent] quarter quarter pretty dramatic
could talk little_bit expectation near term far business
will talk wealth_management let [ner:person] talk insurance
term wealth_management a_couple_of thing go_on
[ner:number] focus group shift term new business metropolitan [ner:location]
open office [ner:date] downtown
group work senator_influence crack business
good business
see continue
add staff lease expire space [ner:date] will [ner:date] expect probably increase amount space probably put team together include commercial lender cash_management_person build little different type delivery_system [ner:date]
a_lot_of_it_and_the_majority folk office will still relate wealth_management
thing happen some_of older market folk older retire primarily able replace folk lower salary_level younger less experienced people
also get brokerage_folk kind fully staff_up [ner:date] hub retail hub
seem work well
combination
mean revenue_growth little_bit ahead plan wealth_management_side business little stronger anticipate
expense_side wonderful job manage expense degradation [ner:date] business believe
think better model [ner:date] little different model [ner:date]
overall net contribution exceed plan probably [ner:number] [ner:percent]
yeah please way thing go
[ner:person] great
thank much
will address question insurance
decline look link_quarter correct
hello
hello
next_question still line mr._[ner:person]
yes sir
okay want address question insurance
insurance actually compare [ner:date] [ner:date] [ner:date]
slightly [ner:money] link_quarter_basis primarily [ner:number] factor
[ner:ordinal] [ner:date] outstanding quarter insurance_agency bring a_couple_of large new account repeat [ner:date]
[ner:date] actually also strong [ner:number] title_insurance_company_activity [ner:number] deal commercial title [ner:number] deal
think factor [ner:date] extra strong [ner:date] normalize
okay ready question
next_question [ner:person] [ner:person] [ner:location]
good afternoon gentleman
quick question related sort liquidity_ratio
sense many liquid asset percentage earn asset would prefer see liquid asset
ask regard obviously deliver [ner:date] want see kind baseline start add security whatnot back liquidity_management_purpose
yeah
[ner:person] utilize various liquidity_ratio economy_liquidity_ratio pretty much red flag
far management_pool find somewhat limit
like use dynamic model sort liquidity_gap look_out [ner:number] [ner:duration] anticipate happen way liquidity
[ner:date] know [ner:date] run model tremendous loan_growth look_out [ner:date] model know start get little_bit sweet
time take a_couple_of different action work_out well liquidity cut back little_bit upside cost_perspective related net interest_margin whenever add liquidity become expensive
[ner:date] go purchase [ner:money] broker_cd
also get little aggressive internally generate cd_program
[ner:date] introduce savings_account call green_plan index [ner:organization]
[ner:duration] add close [ner:money] account attractive
liquidity_issue [ner:date] certainly address
green_plan provide good core_low_cost_internal_fund also fit nicely shift see commercial loan go towards variable rate_loan
thing would mention [ner:number] [ner:percent] new fund
yeah
shift thing cannibalize exist account
probably close [ner:money] [ner:money] raise savings_account new fund outside bank
well guess focus asset_side balance_sheet
point want balance_sheet consist loan asset liability
need source liquidity asset_side as_well
guess question try keep liquid asset percentage total asset earn asset ratio
realize somewhat simplistic rule thumb_approach even manage way
integral part whole asset/liability_management
mean something look [ner:set] ratio
specific target [ner:date] treasurer let ask
[ner:number] policy_limit use run rate like percentage loan letter credit a_kind_of asset specific target security per_se
also look available borrowing_side
share loan letter credit earn asset_ratio
internal memo use like [ner:percent]
okay
[ner:number] last question
[ner:date] ve little_bit volatility excuse mortgage_servicing_rate
guess [ner:duration] upswing [ner:date] downswing next memory may flaw
hold_up [ner:date] think go hold_up go_forward
well know tie long term_interest_rate grow
[ner:date] small minor adjustment valuation fact small guess allowance reserve set aside point interest_rate go_up would small recovery
okay
value [ner:set] [ner:set]
[ner:set]
okay
mean put put_new_rate_on [ner:set] [ner:set]
[ner:set] okay guess question
thank
gentleman question time

let [ner:ordinal] start_off backlog
notice end q3 last speak guy hope work_off approximately 36m backlog net addition [ner:date] look like work right around [ner:number]
give kind sense expectation expect work_off q1
importantly term project_timing large project work_off [ner:date]
well tough say go happen [ner:date] term revenue basically because_of [ner:number] thing
[ner:ordinal] [ner:date] slow [ner:duration]
ability get material timely manner somewhat hamper mill
revenue could expect [ner:date] will probably delay [ner:ordinal] [ner:date]
some_of major project material will come towards [ner:date] definitely [ner:date]
delay material really prevent increase revenue [ner:date] as_well_as weather condition much lack material
slow_down work [ner:duration] [ner:duration] [ner:duration] rather_than normal [ner:number] [ner:duration] range
okay [ner:date] assume delay material directly related steel memory serve little_bit less_than [ner:money] worth steel still sit yard correct
correct some_of work get go mill
mean [ner:money] steel will help smallest shorter turnaround-type project larger project similar let say [ner:organization] announce course job
see backlog go_up little
material order mill
okay say actually great segue [ner:ordinal] question
term bidding_activity hear [ner:organization] also area [ner:location] landscape look [ner:date]
remember last time speak anticipate get increase amount work international area also larger percentage deepwater-type product project excuse
know [ner:organization] potentially push thing back bit scale_back budget affect bidding_climate
well bidding_climate think go improve [ner:date] engineering_firm [ner:date] get busy
talk several deepwater_project come probably [ner:ordinal] [ner:date] hope participate
[ner:date] backlog far deepwater [ner:percent] backlog consider foreign project actually [ner:percent] backlog actually increase foreign backlog [ner:organization] work get
look like foreign work prevalent marketplace at_least point time
however see shelf_project deepwater_project [ner:location] come_out bid around [ner:date]
relate [ner:location] early indication get term hurricane-related work come around know tail-end q1 q2
well see
hurricane-related work send crew offshore work [ner:ordinal] [ner:date]
still work nearly much might think
work [ner:date] really diving_and_pipeline_company
far replace platform entire platform see point time
rely hurricane_damage think whatever go minimal part [ner:date] work
okay great
thanks guy
okay
thank [ner:person]
caller_instruction
[ner:person] ph stone ph research
short question margin [ner:date]
seem historic almost historic low take_out [ner:date]
think go improve go_forward
reason
well know go improve
bid higher margin sure hope improve higher level see [ner:date] guarantee
yeah would like get margin higher [ner:date]
increase workload manhour able hopefully possibly later towards [ner:date] [ner:date] historically better weather_condition work manhour
okay specific reason like raw material something else
like example [ner:ordinal] [ner:date] workload approximately manage best term margin
well understand manhour normally [ner:ordinal] [ner:date]
sometimes bonus play margin happen [ner:date] [ner:date] mean [ner:date] happen [ner:date]
sometimes bonus may go early delivery deliver time incentive customer will give particular job
normally would realize incentive right end project make sure meet delivery
sometimes will see play will actually raise margin
think see [ner:date]
yeah probably thank
thank much
okay [ner:person]
[ner:person] [ner:person]
follow-up question think would jump_on
could [ner:duration] [ner:person] [ner:person] let circle back steel_issue
memory serve correctly recall steel_price [ner:percent] [ner:date] 03-type timeframe
kind get little_bit clarity term raw material buy_out mill much steel need like lower-grade-type steel
guess try get sense much actual steel term volume obviously related lag_time need go_out purchase open market
importantly try kind get sense available go stretch_out duration project
well purchase_order neighborhood will give ballpark_figure
basically larger project [ner:percent] project involve steel_purchase
look larger project [ner:date] [ner:money] worth steel order steel_mill
order will fill [ner:ordinal] partly [ner:date]
order fill rather quickly [ner:date] able start increase manhour hope
way order protect price
price_risk particular order
high-strength steel mild steel mix predominantly a_lot_of high-strength steel
okay great
actually remind another question
housekeeping issue
direct labor_[ner:duration] work [ner:date]
[ner:date] yes
[ner:date] [ner:number]
okay
[ner:date] [ner:person] reference [ner:number]
okay
another quick housekeeping question
notice sg&a [ner:date]
matter fact lowest point full [ner:date]
appropriate type number run
something 1m maybe [ner:number]
[ner:person] range go fall
mean know operation level
[ner:person] directly relationship profitability
sure
okay will fluctuate sg&a anything
sure sure
understand
go say great thing sg&a bit want mention might sore subject
thanks guy
okay
thank [ner:person]
inaudible multiple speaker [ner:person]
[ner:person] [ner:person]
quick question guess go back [ner:date] steel_delivery_issue
something would affect bottom line delivery kind project early stage book profit yet
well book profit need steel able put_manhour_in
know work manhour without steel
result [ner:duration] actually [ner:date] enough material_in-house able work people normal [ner:number] [ner:duration] work_[ner:duration]
know inability work manhour realize earnings manhour remember percent complete
recognize profit add value manhour
right
get steel start value-added work recognize earnings
without steel_in-house number [ner:number] manhour therefore fix cost still profitability high would like see
guess many manhour know affect
hard say really
could speculate [ner:date] look [ner:date] versus [ner:date] look know [ner:number] manhour difference work [ner:date] material in-house versus [ner:date] struggle get material timely basis
broader question guess
know manhour overall [ner:date] versus [ner:date] come
would expect [ner:date] know [ner:date] flat
well depend work pick_up
well indirect way ask
yeah always hope would
yeah
mean goal try get take work get reasonable margin
go go_ahead buy work know
trade_off whether buy work know would rather let competitor take some_of cheaper work wait take little higher-priced work little later [ner:date]
know whatever happen bidding_cycle go determine
best area [ner:date] term bidding_activity
international domestic
well international think will probably see shift domestic hope know [ner:duration]
optimistic [ner:location] go return
well look capex_spending oil_and_gas_producer increase capex_spending overseas also [ner:location] would hope would relate project
talk engineering_firm project draw board [ner:location] know wait see actually materialize
know obviously way road encourage some_of deepwater_rig go back work gulf around know around world yeah seem pretty exciting
know people really excite [ner:date] guess hopeful will relate deepwater_project would like large know top side build last know [ner:number] [ner:duration]
would add backlog could see come_out at_least get competitor busy could pick_up project higher margin
right
[ner:number] [ner:number] last question
constitution [ner:person] could give update progress
quite well
okay
go quite well
run ahead schedule move along quite well
great
thank much [ner:person] [ner:person]
appreciate
yeah
[ner:person] ph red_rock_partners ph
well listen apologize
jump [ner:duration] late
backlog know 82m [ner:number] m_manhour
quite record know pretty decent backlog go [ner:date]
[ner:date] number include everything get since [ner:date] as_well
correct
always report
backlog [ner:date] additional work pick_up since
okay
general bidding know level bidding_activity say [ner:date] versus [ner:date]
well bidding_activity little stronger [ner:date] see [ner:date] [ner:date] somewhat election_[ner:duration] notoriously election_[ner:duration] much happen far development especially [ner:location]
see uptick
engineering_firm busy busier [ner:date] bid project delivery later [ner:date] especially [ner:location] as_well_as international project
dollar help guy maybe get opportunity international [ner:date]
well think [ner:person] might foreign backlog [ner:date] 40m deep mean [ner:percent] backlog [ner:number]
[ner:percent] [ner:percent] backlog foreign [ner:percent] backlog deepwater
see shift towards foreign activity normally run maybe 20-something-percent backlog_work foreign
majority [ner:organization]
well [ner:number]
actually [ner:number] project
course give number normally
right
last indiscernible mean a_lot_of thought maybe a&p_-rsb-_-lsb-_ph_-rsb-_company busy try get production back some_of major repair would push_out some_of big decision would push_out
mean maybe wishful thinking go help [ner:person] little_bit probably little_bit work really see maybe major know major issue some_of contract bid focus repair focus new project
well think talk term dolphin know repair a_lot_of repair
okay
see offshore [ner:date] modification increase production see some_of project term dolphin see
know hopefully will see maybe [ner:number] platform get production sub seed ph well another line increase production_equipment shut-in tie-in
see hurricane_damage
okay great
thanks guy
good job
okay thank [ner:person]
thank [ner:date]
caller_instruction
[ner:person] ph [ner:person] ph
know quick question know theoretically term look business [ner:date]
appear trend set improve certainly [ner:duration] [ner:duration] improve little_bit as_of late
look business [ner:date] bump against [ner:number] m_manhour 100m backlog [ner:date] know start approach point
point know purview know want go term backlog [ner:date] fear lose little_bit efficiency either need stretch staff
word guess try figure_out utilization-wise start bump_up against need start see know margin really expand project decide make kind incremental add backlog
yeah well know increase backlog cautious increase backlog go look project better margin know backlog go somewhat competitor take additional work
think level go back_off
see good project reasonable margin go go_ahead take project know margin
course labor available area [ner:date] could actually increase labor_force without much problem point time
know may change shortly a_lot_of labor market
pick_up labor last [ner:number] [ner:duration] specifically [ner:date] get ready some_of work come board [ner:date] [ner:date]
really pick_up quite a_bit_of work
also beef_up staff_position
hire [ner:number] outstanding project_manager increase ability work work control work [ner:date]
expand staff able handle higher workload come
okay guy already pretty well prepare
correct
okay
thanks
okay
okay
conclude [ner:date] question-and-answer_session
time would like turn_the_call_back_over mr._[ner:person] close comment
okay want thank call_in will talk [ner:date]

[ner:person]_[ner:organization]
good_morning
wonder could give color
[ner:person] think mention inventory partially drive some_of acquisition
know bit sequentially could give sense [ner:person] might contribute inventory build year-over-year
yes [ner:person] [ner:person]
see slight increase inventory [ner:misc]
launch [ner:misc] [ner:location] [ner:location] year-over-year basis see slight increase inventory_level
more_than [ner:percent] increase drive [ner:number] acquisition
[ner:person] [ner:percent] acquisition else would drive
really [ner:number] piece major driver
okay [ner:person] significant enough
yes
okay question term visibility
learn [ner:person] miss [ner:location]
well [ner:person] really really [ner:number] component
biggest component plan call plan miss planned reduction sell-in
a_lot_of analysis business [ner:date] frankly think much sell-in occur q1 [ner:date]
highly seasonal business spend back [ner:duration] essence try balance_out retail inventory much sell-in
least way run business much sell-in
[ner:date] cut back intentionally biggest piece reduction year-over-year planning
[ner:ordinal] component weak sale category_sale man woman shaver [ner:date] both_of category show decline_year-over-year_,_dollar_decline really a_couple_of reason behind
[ner:number] mix-shift low price entrant category sub [ner:money] entrant heavily promote retailer trade dollar versus would look category historically
[ner:number]
[ner:ordinal] [ner:organization] mp3 heavily promote discount holiday_season view datum statistics yet view promotionally take some_of low-end category_growth away
okay
yet despite hit expansion margin quite strong [ner:location]
yes strong
reflection [ner:misc]
mean go back [ner:duration] say [ner:person] go generate [ner:date] say [ner:money] synergy
since update think number [ner:money]
would impact geographic basis [ner:misc] business [ner:location] [ner:location] see flush p&l [ner:date]
perfect
question
thanks much
okay
[ner:person]_[ner:organization]
technical_difficulty hey look like fund debt [ner:organization] extra [ner:money] leave
plan [ner:date] acquisition [ner:date]
see surplus really related revolver
think rest debt term_debt bond right level finance refinance exist debt as_well_as [ner:organization]
flexibility term reasonably good size revolver sit
answer yes tell people [ner:number] key attribute [ner:organization] really like fact significant presence pet_category
fragmented category
[ner:number] want continue find roll-off opportunity acquisition_target keep little indiscernible continue pursue opportunity go_forward
okay great
[ner:misc] battery_business see business_environment become lot rational
mean [ner:organization] pretty decent [ner:location]
look like [ner:organization] kind trajectory
pricing_environment_trend start stabilize little_bit
yes mean [ner:person] go back versus [ner:duration] [ner:number] think see improved pricing_dynamics marketplace general
evidence [ner:number] major competitor [ner:location] battery_margin operate margin [ner:organization] significantly improve
[ner:date] see heighten promotional activity [ner:date] competitor
always see promotional activity [ner:date] because_of holiday_selling
right see kind volume_growth [ner:percent] [ner:location]
yes see slight volume_growth sort flat slightly decline dollar_growth_great
plus-2 minus-2 somewhere range
got
microlite surprise business turn quickly
mean business reach inflection_point
assume business will stay profitable point forward
yes think certainly expect will stay profitable
key component buy business under-capitalized stay afloat borrow money outrageous interest_rate
well recapitalize business eliminate virtually all_of expensive debt incur
good balance_sheet_move
install fantastic management_team result change product_offering rationalize skus
importantly raise average price [ner:organization] [ner:percent] marketplace price_increase stick entirety
principle_competitor [ner:organization] use opportunity increase profitability raise price behind
action take place frankly surprise fastly take hold
surprise go make profitable
expect pretty good fight retailer distributor wholesaler would_say fight last long expect
[ner:date] begin [ner:date] find run low product begin order normal pattern
would suggest [ner:location] go drag [ner:misc] business go_forward
frankly think [ner:duration] go [ner:number] star_performer enormous market_share [ner:percent]
numerical distribution high
must-have brand replace [ner:organization] brand because_of dominance brand marketplace
great
[ner:number] last [ner:number] may
[ner:location] think go start export battery back [ner:location]
know add fair bit alkaline_capacity know long-term plan re-import
go happen sooner rather_than later
think go see amount movement product region
whether [ner:location] [ner:location] [ner:location] really base particular business_issue opportunity might [ner:date]
go see movement product begin [ner:date]
will see throughout [ner:date]
big opportunity [ner:date] bring line high speed double-a triple-a alkaline_line build [ner:date] install facility
still sort [ner:duration] away_from timeframe go see ten hundred million_of battery export versus start
great thanks
mean go take capacity out_of [ner:person]

mean [ner:location] go growth_vehicle alkaline_capacity need [ner:date]
large plant [ner:location] large plant [ner:location] [ner:location]
plant run near capacity alkaline grow around world [ner:date] capacity_need go come out_of [ner:location]
great
thanks much
[ner:person]_[ner:organization]
good_morning gentleman
[ner:person] may address part conclude market_share_issue related remington_[ner:location]
biggest component [ner:misc] [ner:location] man shave
far sort whole [ner:money]
[ner:money] category okay
market_share_issue
fact share slightly improve [ner:date] highest man shave share history [ner:person]
okay
woman category much smaller sort [ner:money] versus [ner:number] see share_loss woman category [ner:number] market
several low-priced offering come marketplace price_point [ner:person] historically sell product probably want sell product take shift mix take share away_from result
still try analyze movement action line-up adjustment need go [ner:date]
finally [ner:location] personal care business grow [ner:location]
grow [ner:percent] [ner:location] [ner:date]
small business
fundamentally would_say shift material term market_share
shift international moment
confident sustainability growth [ner:location] [ner:location] relate [ner:person]
conclude part success thus far simply fill pipeline prior especially robust
think probably little_bit
short answer assume continued significant growth [ner:location] internationally roll_out geography
[ner:location] biggest piece growth [ner:location] grow dramatically [ner:location] [ner:date] biggest piece relate personal care_business [ner:location] fire
launch wet_[ner:number] product could keep stock
heavily advertise tv [ner:location] fantastic success
see triple effect launch [ner:misc] continent [ner:date] yet come
[ner:date] [ner:number] go see continued growth out_of [ner:misc] [ner:location] because_of geographic expansion particularly shave man shave business well-developed prior acquisition
[ner:location] test_market [ner:location] [ner:date] [ner:misc] significant success
learning_experience
know learn ship enough product market [ner:date] [ner:ordinal] sell out_of [ner:misc] retailer sell product
learn something get ready [ner:date] launch [ner:misc] [ner:location] area [ner:location] area [ner:location]
rollout albeit will smaller business_model [ner:location] rollout [ner:misc] [ner:location] really begin
[ner:number]
[ner:person] could drill_down little term battery_business share we_alkaline zinc_carbon large-pack product
internal dynamics [ner:date]
unit_shipment alkaline slightly
dollar_sale alkaline_excuse i_dollar_unit_sale alkaline slightly
unit_dollar_sale alkaline
negative pricing [ner:number] [ner:percent] [ner:date]
combination movement bigger pack_size something occur long time
as_well_as fundamental shift higher-priced alkaline lower-priced alkaline heavy duty
heavy duty grow [ner:date] low-end shopper totally value_shopper mass_discount dollar_store buy heavy duty zinc_carbon_product
resurrection zinc_carbon fashion
yes would_say short-term
personally think differ view personally think sort short-term resurrection
retailer heavily promote specific item
long-term trend [ner:misc] marketplace continue convert alkaline
way [ner:number] [ner:percent] convert [ner:date] see trend zinc_carbon go [ner:percent] business [ner:date]
maybe go grow extra [ner:number] [ner:percent] short term
long-term trend
long term_trend [ner:location] convert alkaline actually accelerate conversion alkaline [ner:location] [ner:location] [ner:location] know still almost totally zinc_carbon_market
zinc_carbon represent [ner:number] out_of every [ner:number] battery sell world general battery_segment [ner:date]
[ner:location] develop
[ner:person] [ner:number] question
probably miss could give battery_revenue [ner:misc] [ner:date]
yes [ner:person]
hang [ner:duration]
[ner:misc] [ner:money] [ner:number]
thank
okay thanks [ner:person]
[ner:person]_[ner:organization]
thanks good_morning
go back cost_savings [ner:duration]
could tell [ner:date] total [ner:misc]
sort give idea break_out geographically
yes [ner:person] really impossible really identify [ner:person] mention see [ner:money] annualize estimate
would_say [ner:date] probably realize [ner:money] [ner:money]
net year-over-year will see [ner:money] [ner:money] extra [ner:date]
really quantify geography specific line_item
really [ner:person] try
business detailed plan get synergy execute program track
frankly something else
[ner:date] something else
yes [ner:date] finish integration essentially totally new business_model new functional structure try go back track exactly various component
end_up new integrate business different cost_structure go_forward allow improve margin
okay
term [ner:misc] shave issue
wonder know say still analyze go_on sound like maybe [ner:number] issue could line blur little_bit new sort power_''_product wet shave category
wonder risk product really go start compete product
would_say mean view would long-term growth
emotionally drive shift will see occur fundamental change consumer
get go back consumer_behavior
either wet shaver dry shaver
[ner:location] [ner:number] market-place wet shave
reverse [ner:location]
change
term [ner:date] season like gift-giving big deal least [ner:organization] mp3 promote product price_point think make nice stock stuffer a_lot_of people stocking [ner:location]
think promotional strategy may short promotional shift certainly long-term fundamental category_shift dry wet shave
would_say
okay sense straight inventory_level point
mean issue clear
sort [ner:misc] industry-wide issue
view industry industry seasonal industry face challenge try figure_out right business_model shipment
want try reach inflection_point cost yourself_sale want big return_pipeline come way
make conscious decision [ner:misc] specific make conscious decision cut_that_back
certainly enter [ner:date] much better shape retail inventory_standpoint [ner:date]
sort plan move part
unhappy fight high inventory much [ner:date] [ner:date] deal return thing around particularly like
know say ourself good business_move
uhm_hum
finally topic some_of new product advertising marketing_support go [ner:date] incremental kind result happen [ner:date]
something plan fund budgeting_process go eat [ner:misc] cost_savings
completely plan go back [ner:duration]
completely plan review discuss retail customer surprise
will fundamental affect way run business
fact [ner:date] in_spite_of reduce inventory specifically spend money [ner:misc] year-over-year ever
okay good thanks
[ner:number] final quick [ner:number]
inventory primarily drive decline cash_flow operation
mean [ner:person] mention mean hit expec cash_flow hit expectation [ner:date]
inventory see go_up slightly offset receivable decline
anticipate increase [ner:misc] because_of growth_[ner:location] [ner:location]
plus mention [ner:location]
pretty much hit expectation [ner:date]
slightly exceed internal
okay look big shift cash generate rest [ner:date]
watch [ner:date]
yes watch [ner:date]
good
sorry
yes [ner:date] good multiple speaker q2
okay thank
[ner:person]_[ner:organization]
good_morning
hey connie
could comment little_bit gross margin give breakdown negative mix acquisition decline
detail connie
[ner:number] thing talk comment reset standard [ner:date]
think everybody aware see commodity_and_material_price_increase flow year-over-year standard
tend offset course [ner:date] a_lot_of cost-reduction initiative
part margin_compression result new standard go fiscal [ner:date] expect cost-reduction thing kick_in [ner:date] will see will able offset impact margin_structure
standard mean
amount particular product amount charge cost sale
manufacturing_cost carry product inventory sell charge cost sale
okay
look gross margin go_forward [ner:date] one-time decline decline rest [ner:date] get little_bit easier quarter
see improvement [ner:duration] gross profit_margin
mean will less
will overall will slightly [ner:date] because_of [ner:location] microlite
consecutive quarter_basis see growth gross profit_margin q2 q1
will year-over [ner:duration] q2
yes slightly yes
[ner:location] microlite operate low gross margin
relatively small still impact corporate composite average
okay q2_gross_margin decline year-over-year [ner:ordinal] half flat slightly
yes model [ner:date] probably go somewhere around [ner:number] basis_point year-over-year basis_decline
technical difficulty
pretty big decline
model know anybody else
okay thanks
[ner:person]_[ner:organization]
guy try get underlying impact margin_line cost_savings
tell dollar_basis commodity_inflation_impact [ner:date]
[ner:date]
tell [ner:date] project battery_part business [ner:money] see year-over-year increase
[ner:date] project cost-reduction initiative [ner:money] so_that [ner:date] will offset impact business
specific breakout [ner:date]
get
[ner:misc] decline [ner:location] much relate change shipment_strategy
half significant piece
okay category still single-digits double-digit estimation
woman category
number real firm [ner:date]
yes sure
woman category double-digits small category
still important focus
man category technical difficulty
could give little detail dynamics shipment know want beat thing death talk lot mean will retailer general request stuff channel essentially guy basically pull back get flack

mean go
seasonal category people always trouble try define exactly right consumer_takeaway likely
a_lot_of forecasting thing like go analysis
say [ner:number] bigger problem seasonal company seasonal category
[ner:date] think make good judgment base_on [ner:person] historic sell-in [ner:date] sell-in key retailer
terrific sale_season [ner:date] drive market_share highest level history
work
still end_up much inventory come back way
determine [ner:date] better job manage

create anything comp_issue [ner:duration]
will year-over-year return meaningful impact business
think will meaningful impact comp_year-end
[ner:number] [ner:number]
obviously push towards zinc_carbon_battery lately participate_in
mean gain shelf_space zinc_carbon expense alkaline anywhere
significant shift [ner:number] major competitor term distribution [ner:date]
significant shift alkaline zinc_carbon_business
know technical difficulty zinc_carbon really growth occur zinc_carbon business benefit as_well_as [ner:number] competitor business drive discount_and_dollar_store
okay thanks
[ner:person]_[ner:organization]
verify something get confuse little_bit discussion gross margin [ner:date]
mention gross margin will somewhat [ner:date]
[ner:ordinal] obviously exclude [ner:organization] right
purely correct
right
discussion core_business
acquisition take place yet
right
none really [ner:ordinal] part gross margin year-over-year back half versus [ner:date]
[ner:date] slightly year-over-year basis
okay
back-half improvement year-over-year
indiscernible [ner:person] sort [ner:number] basis_point [ner:date]
fundamental shift occur margin inclusion [ner:location] microlite margin overall corporate margin okay
roll standard [ner:person] try explain roll standard beginning fiscal [ner:duration] load plan anticipate increase price commodity standard roll_out margin
go [ner:date] generate cost_reduction favorable variance flow p&l
okay
a_lot_of favorable variance occur [ner:date] inventory give credit variance inventory actually flow_out revenue
know get far technical would suggest [ner:date] essence reduce because_of
enhance go [ner:date] roll_out cost_reduction
okay
make perfect sense
probably mixed benefit hopefully [ner:misc] sell back-half [ner:date]
right
right
yes product_mix_improvement
right
housekeeping cash_balance [ner:date] please
multiple speaker [ner:money]
[ner:number]
yes
[ner:date] know want talk much detail [ner:organization] big picture_perspective plan major integration course [ner:duration]
give peak_season [ner:organization] want leave alone [ner:date] thing slow_down start [ner:date]
right
go think go virtually nothing business [ner:organization] peak selling_season would june/july okay
activity will a_lot_of planning will a_lot_of integration_planning [ner:organization] as_well_as so_that know want later
will busily work purchase initiative global purchasing_strategy enjoy quicker
will also work it_group system_integration financial system_integration ultimately [ner:organization] will take place
will take place key season
okay
term impact fiscal [ner:date] deal will accretive will slightly accretive fiscal [ner:date]
synergy really go flow deal [ner:date] [ner:date] [ner:duration] come
a_lot_of implementation distribution_-lrb-_ph_-rrb-_will_also_be_[ner:date] [ner:date]
yes will [ner:date] [ner:date]
right
will a_lot_of work
last question give timeframe spend [ner:organization] know go provide a_lot_of detail [ner:date] overall view still bar acquisition way see business go combine planning still see close [ner:date] de-leveraging bar acquisition full pro_forma_basis [ner:date]
yes new projection see [ner:misc] take_off [ner:number] whole turn leverage [ner:duration] ownership business
projection let caution expectation will able [ner:organization]
great
thank
mr._[ner:person] time show [ner:duration] remain a_total_of [ner:number] participant queue
well let take question
thank
[ner:person]_[ner:organization]
hi good_morning
a_couple_of quick question
give sense [ner:organization] [ner:date]
really designate [ner:organization] versus [ner:misc] versus [ner:organization] anymore since integrate [ner:misc] [ner:location]
think really want take look [ner:organization] would take look [ner:location] result
yes
[ner:misc] result [ner:location] also
okay also issue standard quite understand exactly meaning
know talk variance shift term move anything out_of sg&a cog


normal process [ner:set] adjust standard product
yes think [ner:duration] see cost_improvement type thing basically sit inventory roll_that_product_out normal sale_channel
say see good year-over-year cost_improvement [ner:date] sit inventory will get basically wash [ner:duration]
load all_of bad news even project bad news might think might occur throughout [ner:date] standard cost put none benefit already identify far outweigh bad news load will generate [ner:date]
will flow_out [ner:duration] inventory_flow
okay could ask couple quick
typical standard cost system
yes
make little_bit sense
ask couple quick housekeeping cash tax interest [ner:date]
interest [ner:money] interest cash_,_tax_number low
okay thank
[ner:person]_[ner:organization]
good_morning
recap say expect raw material_cost rise [ner:money] [ner:date]

let go back
let go back
multiple speaker cost go many material manufacturer use [ner:date]
[ner:date] see cost_increase
project standard cost [ner:date] roll higher cost standard
[ner:money] worldwide battery_business
part culture continuously look way improve efficiency reduce cost
whole series initiative lay_out [ner:date] already benefit will kick later [ner:date] will total [ner:money] cost_reduction
right
net net fiscal [ner:date] actually will see manufacturing_perspective lower cost
get
raw material_side [ner:date] hedge lose stock_market
see belief category peak occur [ner:date] actually see moderation level off_of cost_increase
see [ner:date] sit exposure business
time stock_market
place zinc
commodity use much battery_manufacturing
hedge protect
get

hi guy [ner:person]
sure tip hand could give sort pro_forma apple apple organic kind constant currency_sale [ner:date]
[ner:date] sorry
think mention euro probably significant piece contribute [ner:money] year-over-year sale_increase
okay
would use number
thank
also acquisition_front a_lot_of discussion
know really talk thing detail say whether_or_not sort poke_around something [ner:date]
something potentially feel imminent
say
close acquisition [ner:ordinal]
well comment helpful like topic_dujour
right well will remain topic_dujour
know get hand full close acquisition
yes
honest forthright announce acquisition investor_meeting investor_call stockholder_meeting bank_meeting
understood
will continue look thing interest
interest pet_category
think rollup_opportunity could exist
a_sort_of like-size acquisition like [ner:organization] know plan marketplace
get hand full
helpful
thanks guy
[ner:person]_[ner:organization]
hi inaudible question highly accented language
give idea battery_division percent sale come heavy duty_battery versus alkaline_battery
also idea price margin_differential [ner:number]
vary tremendously region country [ner:date]
go [ner:location] know probably [ner:number] sale zinc_carbon versus alkaline because_of nature market
[ner:location] [ner:percent] market alkaline
think less_than [ner:percent] zinc_carbon sale probably model pretty closely
term revenue alkaline_battery will sell depend pack_size etcetera etcetera average may [ner:number] zinc_carbon sell obviously amount margin_dollar get greater alkaline_battery zinc_carbon_battery because_of pricing_dynamic
manufacturer like sell alkaline
zinc_carbon low price_point_product fit certain part world think right kind battery sell [ner:location]
actually out_of total battery_sale total general battery_sale would round cell_battery around world [ner:money] [ner:date] [ner:money] alkaline
technical difficulty [ner:number] general battery_business
thank

operator take [ner:number] question
think [ner:date] [ner:duration] will close_it_up
follow-up [ner:person] [ner:location]
okay sorry [ner:person] quickly
probably mention could comment eps comfort range [ner:date]
comment [ner:date]
try best get away_from specific [ner:set] guidance
know [ner:date] big new [ner:misc] give guidance [ner:date] really guidance give quarter indiscernible
okay thank
yes
okay
well thanks
appreciate time continue interest [ner:organization] look forward see many [ner:date] [ner:set] investor_conference will lay_out much detail [ner:organization] early integration_plan particularly area cost_savings cash_cost etcetera
thanks great [ner:duration]
conclude [ner:date] [ner:organization] earnings_conference_call
many [ner:date] disconnect
operator_instruction [ner:person]
[ner:number] question
apologize mention could walk operate margin pro_forma_operate_margin deteriorated sequentially optoelectronics [ner:organization] though [ner:number] business sequentially
hello hear
say [ner:person]
sorry
optoelectronics_and_[ner:organization] sequentially yet pro_forma_operate_margin decrease somewhat
talk segment hurt margin sequentially
yes guess look [ner:person]_[ner:organization] perspective sequentially operate margin pretty significantly
also look sort [ner:number] [ner:number]
yes
look like [ner:organization] go little_bit sequentially
think go see spend [ner:money] r&d [ner:date]
start ramp r&d_increase [ner:date] [ner:date] [ner:date]
start experience some_of higher r&d_spending technical difficulty
okay thank
[ner:ordinal] question talk flash cell_phone_camera [ner:duration] half [ner:date]
know design couple_handset already
predicate handset_ship volume new design_win
[ner:person] think predicate volume_growth
fairly large volume_base
drive adoption higher-resolution ccd_imager cmo_imager phone underway [ner:date]
expect see benefit [ner:ordinal] half time get indiscernible type volume_measurement
design broad range potential customer
couple significantly
think begin see volume
okay thank much
[ner:person]
prepared remark mention see improve demand liquid handling high-throughput screening drug_discovery
could elaborate
customer
quote_activity
start see order
comment [ner:person] fact look growth q3 year-over-year versus q4 actually contraction see q3 [ner:number] business improve relative q3
would_say probably significant improvement see liquid handling sequentially business would_say [ner:percent]
would_say new product start get_out market
think believe may pent-up demand people decide spend q4
would_say significant [ner:number]
would_say case reagent drug_discovery concerted effort try get_back market_share believe lose earlier [ner:date] start see
probably sequentially [ner:percent] [ner:date]
drug_discovery high throughput_screening think see really nice growth particularly envision_productline actually a_record_shipment_number_of envisions would_say modest price_high_throughput_screening_instrument
think continue see nice growth hopefully continue see [ner:date]
know touch [ner:person] [ner:date] [ner:number] additional revenue_growth think could get acquisition include eps_forecast [ner:date] correct

okay great
thank
operator_instruction [ner:person] [ner:person]
growth_rate molecular diagnostic_business
know say electrodiagnostic [ner:person] small segment_line
really break_it_out
guess describe diagnostic_business general think [ner:number]
okay
would_say genetic screening_business
think [ner:person] give number
[ner:percent] [ner:person]
land large contract state [ner:location]
kick
state [ner:location] take [ner:duration] get laboratory fully run go volume_testing
expect [ner:date]
optimistic particular state_legislation initiative [ner:person]
know
optimistic state market
many state go public discussion sensitive stage
like comment particular state
would_say stand back marketplace strong momentum move everybody 30-test standard care
mention earlier [ner:percent] state_test [ner:number] less
see ramp_up quickly across wide range state
expect typical level seasonality analytical instrument_side business big sequential slowdown q1
business strongest quarter always [ner:date] seasonally [ner:ordinal] strongest quarter [ner:ordinal] [ner:ordinal] [ner:ordinal] weakest [ner:date]
see still continue
yes
think sort rhythm
think rhythm marketplace
part budget_release [ner:date] always come [ner:date]
tone as_well_on [ner:organization]
change order_flow [ner:date]
also thought [ner:misc] market [ner:person]
think see much change [ner:person] go
overall would_say [ner:ordinal] see a_lot_of change [ner:organization] [ner:number] way another
expectation general market_environment economy continue temper recovery overall help segment
within biopharmaceutical think really drive new product_introduction
think biotech academic research_market continue move along fairly consistently pharmaceutical company really midst transition away_from big blockbuster_model specialize medicine_model
go restructure go_on industry period time
think therefore really drive around identify right growth_segment feed new product
think really recovery_mechanism segment think everything else get little_bit tailwind economic recovery
okay thanks
[ner:person] [ner:person]
actually [ner:person] [ner:person]
question go back neonatal screening_market
[ner:number] competitor [ner:date] also speak optimism market
wonder could comment competitive landscape capture growth neonatal screening

waters
actually waters partner go marketplace
agree optimism
look [ner:location] [ner:location] conjunction waters
supply tandem mass_spectrometer supply complete system
use tandem mass_spectrometer_instrument system a_number_of new program go state
think say parallel use instrumentation a_number_of installation
okay
secondly catch guidance interest_expense_line [ner:date]
could recap
interest forecast [ner:number]
would [ner:number] level [ner:date]
okay thank
operator_instruction [ner:person]
[ner:organization]
congratulation [ner:date]
a_couple_of quick question
[ner:ordinal] regard some_of fastest-growing market see [ner:duration] [ner:location]
comment growth_rate market
see change
mention earlier see [ner:location] [ner:percent] organically q4
little misleading [ner:number] thing impact photoflash business fairly significantly
think pull_that_out would grow [ner:location] probably high single low double digit
think go_forward think fairly optimistic
look specifically [ner:location] [ner:location] [ner:number] country spike_up grow sort mid [ner:percent] [ner:date]
grant still off_of relatively low base still see nice growth a_number_of area within [ner:location]
okay thanks
shift gear regard [ner:date] cash_flow intention continue pay_down debt
some_of use might free cash_flow [ner:date]
get point much debt pay_down
mention balance term_loan [ner:number]
beyond would subordinated note may know trade quite well market
would suspect will buy
therefore think priority really shift business_development acquisition_side
say [ner:date] think a_number_of opportunity would like make either productline extension technology_add-on
get number pipeline hopefully get conclude [ner:date]
okay thanks
last question regard digital flat-panel display [ner:misc] still pretty strong
talk briefly competitive advantage may particular product drive manufacturer product_area
largest marketplace industry-leading volume think industry-leading product
advantage will recall product codevelop partner [ner:organization] [ner:duration] [ner:date] really
significant presence will call manufacturer glass glass_panel in_addition_to complete detector
fully integrate supply_chain
kind unique respect marketplace
fully integrate supply_chain take complete detector_level significant volume
exclusive provider [ner:organization] provide a_number_of folk as_well
look a_variety_of technical measure term frame per [ner:ordinal] speed sensitivity_measure think product good
thanks much
[ner:person]_[ner:organization]
want ask little_bit tax happen [ner:date] could give sense expect [ner:date] would go slowly explanation tax_rate [ner:date] would appreciate
thing look might affect tax_rate [ner:number] way go [ner:date] please
think tax_area a_lot_of good thing technical difficulty [ner:duration]
[ner:ordinal] go [ner:date] lower rate [ner:date] largely drive better mix income geographically quite frankly profitable
become profitable foreign net operating_loss overseas therefore improve tax_rate
go think go sort [ner:number]
think get midyear feel closer [ner:number] maybe [ner:number]
q4 favorable resolution dispute [ner:organization] business sell number [ner:date]
result able reverse reserve set_up book back number [ner:date]
time sure aware pass new law allow corporation [ner:date] repatriate [ner:number] time foreign profit reduce rate
instead_of pay [ner:percent] [ner:date] bring_it_back [ner:number]
make decision point repatriate cash overseas
think [ner:percent] provide cost [ner:date] as_well
[ner:money] less benefit receive settlement [ner:organization]
therefore impact reduce rate [ner:date] something closer [ner:percent]
[ner:date] tax_rate will [ner:number]
material effect full-year tax_rate provide [ner:money] benefit q4
go_forward think because_of combination income as_well_as benefit bring_the_cash_back reduce rate think continue put downward pressure tax_rate
go [ner:date] fairly optimistic highest will [ner:number]
think opportunity maybe get [ner:number]
will see thing go enter [ner:date]
like say think a_number_of positive thing tax_side continue look try drive rate
could follow-up a_couple_of question term growth_rate_scenario
give growth_rate instrument within las
consumable say [ner:percent] normally consumable reagent category refer
[ner:percent] give specific hts drug_discovery_reagent
reagent across las growth_rate [ner:percent]
instruments [ner:percent] mention service [ner:number]
get las_growth little [ner:percent]
got
last quick thing digital imaging percentage opto
give number
think give [ner:percent] roughly
thank
operator_instruction [ner:person]_[ner:organization]
wonder give growth might difference [ner:location] [ner:location]
see difference pattern within [ner:number] economy geography guess
will ask [ner:person] comment well would_say economic recovery_standpoint think [ner:location] lag [ner:location] think sort depend business look
maybe could talk maybe industrial biopharma broadly
would_say relatively think las_business see stronger growth [ner:location] [ner:location] [ner:date]
look [ner:organization] [ner:misc] heavily dominate oem base [ner:location] course continue see strong growth [ner:location]
[ner:person] across corporation mention [ner:location] grow much stronger organic basis [ner:location] [ner:location]
however look within business [ner:person] mention [ner:location] fastest-growing [ner:location] [ner:ordinal] [ner:location] [ner:ordinal]
case opto fluid clearly [ner:location] fastest-growing significant measure
mention particularly opto because_of decrease see photoflash actually slightly [ner:date]
okay
great
thank much
[ner:person]_[ner:organization]
[ner:person] [ner:ordinal] question many [ner:duration] additionally [ner:date] [ner:date]
[ner:number] business_[ner:duration]
give sense work [ner:date] close [ner:date] [ner:ordinal]
[ner:date] close [ner:date] [ner:ordinal]
[ner:number] business_[ner:duration] want point_out [ner:duration] talk basically holidays
think holiday
think material_impact
fact go back test
really minimal impact product
reason impact service service_business contractual
amortize sort straight-line number [ner:duration]
fact [ner:duration] provide additional revenue
mention think less_than [ner:percent] revenue
fact case las even affect percentage_growth still round [ner:percent] even adjust service_revenue
fairly minor impact want make sure people aware couple extra [ner:date]
make sense
respect gross margin outlook [ner:number] basis_point gross margin_expansion besides absence some_of restructuring_expense [ner:date] close [ner:location] [ner:location] facility else lead type gross margin_expansion
ph [ner:duration] narrower gross margin
would_say [ner:number] thing
[ner:ordinal] point mention cost [ner:date] will repeat [ner:date]
think [ner:ordinal] aspect growth let say [ner:percent] organic generate variable cost_basis improve gross margin
think [ner:ordinal] aspect look expect grow [ner:date] whether genetic screening imaging consumer_electronics tendency higher-margin business
think growth work_out way expect [ner:date] [ner:date] actually think will favorable mix gross margin_line
okay
thanks
[ner:person]
look a_couple_of growth_rate las_division growth_rate really accelerate q4
example service_business pick_up
think gain share
look genetic screening thing happen
think some_of state get board [ner:number] test could lead revise intermediate-term growth_rate business [ner:number]
think take service genetic screening feel good competitive position
tend little_bit lumpiness particularly genetic screening base timing order forth
states move tandem mass_spec_arena big impact [ner:date]
really a_[ner:date] driver
would_say remain cautiously optimistic business will turn back [ner:person]
think go change forecast point
think [ner:person] point_out feel great momentum see q2 q4 growth_rate give [ner:date] probably little early start think take_we_forecast_up
momentum move right direction feel [ner:person] mention good competitive situation
little tough early people come_out number really decide whether take share yet
okay thank
appear question time
will turn conference back [ner:person] close additional comment
thanks everyone question
feel good progress [ner:date] optimistic prospects [ner:date]
go [ner:date] strong organization efficient operation strong balance_sheet clear focus growth_platform
mention increase investment r&d [ner:percent] accelerate innovation growth attractive opportunity
thanks time [ner:date] interest [ner:organization]
call adjourn
great [ner:duration]
thank everyone
conclude [ner:date] conference
thank participation
on_behalf_of [ner:date] speaker would like wish everyone great [ner:duration]
operator_instruction [ner:person]
[ner:organization]
could give capex_plan [ner:date] please
think will hand_over [ner:person]
good afternoon side as_well
[ner:date] total capex will exceed [ner:number]
[ner:money] rollover ph [ner:date] [ner:date] plan use less amount
sorry say more_than [ner:number] [ner:date] say something
say total capex [ner:date] will [ner:number] out_of [ner:number] [ner:number] rollover [ner:date] [ner:date]
see
[ner:date] say still [ner:number] [ner:number] minus
promise use more_than [ner:money] see overall situation improve
okay thank
[ner:person]
[ner:organization]
would like ask question graphic paper specialty_business
say loss still big mean even add back exceptional
question really paper_machine really need close unprofitable
[ner:number] thing cause pretty big loss moment operative efficiency cost_level forth good level indiscernible operation [ner:location]
announce [ner:date] pretty big restructuring_program operation indiscernible reflex ph mail ph
[ner:number] reason
also cleaning house_effect [ner:date] business_area big thing
need improve profitability coated fine papers
need improve cost_efficiency pretty much
also utilize capacity better way
still certain mill operate totally unsatisfactory operating_ratio
need pretty extensive cost_save_measure also increase revenue
cost-cutting measure take think mill give something like [ner:number] maybe [ner:percent] [ner:duration] will achieve cost capital
yes definitely target
mill like mention plan really get back reasonable profitability_level need major cost-saving major also increase revenue indiscernible
concrete plan make happen
term [ner:number] cost-cutting plan much relate market_improvement much relate actual reduction cost
[ner:number] main part something pure cost_thing cost_type thing
pretty_little relate market_situation operating_rate
expect amount cost take_out [ner:date] sort run_rate would see [ner:date]
extremely difficult estimate [ner:date] indiscernible cash_flow_effect [ner:date] internal target value measure will complete [ner:date] half [ner:number] target
thanks much
value measure
thanks much indeed
[ner:person]
[ner:organization]
question regard cost_savings_program as_well
much extra cost need take [ner:date] in_order achieve full [ner:number]
certainly will [ner:number] time_cost relate program clear number give
speak many ten_of million need make happen
certainly will cost_reserve make new program happen
publish some_of new program will publish ready publish
remind extraordinary item nonrecurr item book amount [ner:number] include indiscernible [ner:misc] will actually benefit will receive [ner:date] cost already reserve [ner:date] book
okay thank
[ner:person]
[ner:organization]
question graphic division result volume high delivery high sort growth record_delivery low operating_rate look like even bigger discrepancy usually [ner:date] typically mean destocking
happen
could explain difference big low high inventory moment division
take year-end inventory_situation magazine_papers coated fine papers normal level
okay
particular reason achievement high
related because_of ongoing price_increase explain
sort export
think perhaps stock effect because_of price_increase see major major effect because_of kind reason
okay
maybe final question theme differ view accord_to peer suggest think coated fine inventory fairly high might make difficult raise price coated fine papers
seem little_bit optimistic front
situation know get price_increase
mention [ner:percent] will achieve [ner:date] compare_to situation_quarter_number [ner:number] [ner:date]
probably will start discuss new round [ner:date]
accurate information
clear need plan let see proceed
okay
final question carton_deliveries steady growth volume
see continue growth continue will volume stabilize
also quality_mix think must change [ner:date] price_mix output
yes little bit_exceptional_[ner:date]
expect see kind growth_figure [ner:date] compare_to [ner:date]
growth expect happen sale_volume indiscernible boxboard
major change far sale_mix concerned regard different quality
thank much
[ner:person]
[ner:organization]
wonder clarify cost_savings say report increase estimate cost_savings still [ner:number]
mean will [ner:date] come quicker anticipate
right
notice right sell share present corporate story [ner:date] message will achieve [ner:number] [ner:date]
[ner:date] increase target [ner:number] so_that achieve [ner:number] [ner:date] still [ner:number] target [ner:date]
okay great
basically [ner:number] [ner:date] whole savings
sorry
basically [ner:number] [ner:date] total cost_savings expect multiple speaker
take consideration_[ner:date] [ner:date]
yes
full impact [ner:ordinal] basically [ner:date] full [ner:duration]
exactly
follow_up [ner:person] question competitor announce result [ner:date] talk coated fine paper_price basically stable uncoated pressure talk price be_up competitor also say bit earlier [ner:date]
could shed light say indiscernible sign contract already still sort estimate price_development
big extent fact
know go happen
agreement will get price_increase
estimate [ner:date]
say [ner:percent] [ner:percent] q1 versus end q4 average q1 versus average q4
end end
final question paperboard
talk [ner:percent] higher price roughly share paperboard_volume would affect
whole sale_volume
yes average change whole division_volume
certain agreement certain part business totally fix price [ner:date] [ner:date] part price_increase bigger forth
close_to [ner:percent] whole mix folding boxboard_product
[ner:number] final question attain positive result [ner:date] much price_hike need [ner:percent] coated fine paper [ner:percent] paperboard
need
grade
course mean also office_paper_price get least stable situation
thank much
[ner:person]
indiscernible
[ner:date] [ner:duration] major producer look get_they_coated_wood_free_price_up
succeed way
start process end [ner:date] meet pretty tough situation
get little_bit [ner:date] indiscernible main effect earlier mention increase will come will go [ner:date]
[ner:date]
would
intention much higher announce [ner:date] onward aim increase price [ner:percent] [ner:date] great success
[ner:date] look basically [ner:date] make announcement say look increase coated uncoated woodfree_price [ner:date] [ner:percent]
look
look promising
[ner:date] get percentage [ner:date] percentage less disappear
aim really stabilize situation part course major need all_of break trend
understand uncoated woodfree_price even stabilize drop [ner:duration]
success whatsoever coated woodfree_side
could manage get_you_price_up [ner:number] [ner:number] [ner:money] much success either
yes like say compare_to [ner:date] [ner:date] will get average [ner:location] [ner:number] close [ner:percent]
sorry coated [ner:percent] coated woodfree
uncoated sign stability think [ner:date] look unlikely well [ner:date]
almost impossible estimate
main target [ner:date] stabilize situation everything could begin price increase process
hopefully [ner:date] [ner:date]
hello
question would regard [ner:person] plan [ner:organization]
plan keep [ner:organization] long term
something look selloff [ner:date]
yes plan keep [ner:organization] start program improve quality so_that competitiveness [ner:date] would better [ner:date]
pretty much question
thank much
thanks
[ner:organization]
question merchant_division
check average [ner:misc] longer time_period close_to [ner:number] [ner:date] adjust non-recurring item ebit excess [ner:number]
wonder could shed light business perform [ner:date] expect [ner:duration] ahead
thank
pretty much business usual map_margin [ner:date]
nothing special happen
short history map guy able improve cost_efficiency part m-real_group
like notice [ner:date] publish new restructuring_program concern especially operation [ner:location] still problem_unit process go_on
aim improve operational efficiency map_merchants
main question whether anything_special_worth mention [ner:date]
pretty much business usual
profitability_level map
sort seasonality aware [ner:date] move [ner:date] actually expect good result move [ner:ordinal] [ner:date]
course [ner:date] good [ner:duration] like [ner:date] [ner:date] least half [ner:date]
[ner:date] affect also paper_merchanting
see major change compare quarter_number [ner:number] quarter_number [ner:number]
perhaps little_bit weak average quarter [ner:number] major change
talk generally restructuring_cost could also include [ner:organization] [ner:date]
talk [ner:duration]

kind thought kind plan would publish major new restructuring_program map affect cost
go_on [ner:location] reserve eur5 [ner:number] purpose book [ner:date]
[ner:number] final question
operation_line [ner:misc] could give guidance expect go_forward
vary quite significantly [ner:duration] [ner:date]
operation actually typical pattern tend change [ner:date] another
think take average figure think average see [ner:date] relatively close see [ner:date]
think structural change
structural change far operation concern get net income come forest_asset
profitability_effect transaction will [ner:number]
get net income sale forest get instead_of positive effect net financial item so_that profitability_effect will [ner:number]
excellent thank
[ner:person]
[ner:organization] question
[ner:ordinal] tax_rate [ner:date] [ner:date] exclude goodwill_amortization use
include actually disregard certain small tax-free income relatively good rate use [ner:percent]
okay
mention [ner:date] reduce [ner:organization] plan quite interesting almost couple [ner:number] combined [ner:duration] period
reflection desire maximize cash_flow pay_down debt farther reflection compare_to [ner:number] [ner:date] outlook weaker
reflect change far estimation [ner:date] concern
kind overall consideration good level next come [ner:duration]
like [ner:person] tell [ner:date] will close_to [ner:number] [ner:date] plan go_ahead also level
basically [ner:date] charge course conjunction ifrs_view turn_around company less cash spend sort view
want comment much basically need consider appropriate kind purpose
policy like tell really critical pick_up different project far capex concern
really concentrate short payback_type project
main reason
okay [ner:number] final question
[ner:number] dividend_policy
[ner:date] establish [ner:money]
view stable dividend go_forward would dividend_level sort will decide raise earnings go_up
yes
raise earnings go yes
yes kind take position stable level course
earnings get better course intention propose better dividend
everything comment
fair enough
finally incentive_program could say anything sort trigger_point
related [ner:misc] return capital_employ_target
kind target [ner:number] share award management
kind level need reach target [ner:date] specifically
go detail get full package share [ner:date] available need pretty pretty big improvement profit
would clearly clearly positive pretax profit major improvement also far return capital employ concern
target_level pretty high maximize share_amount come
ambition_level high
excellent thank
[ner:organization]
listen call talk restructure asset everywhere everything graphic side [ner:organization]
much investment need spend marchine_park ph good shape competitive would please
long-term process
totally impossible answer short sentence need get basis much greater shape moment
pretty happy level [ner:duration]
hear indiscernible obviously rebuild a_number_of machine say [ner:number] machine [ner:date]
rebuild machine way anyway costly i.e. actually hit p&l
expect see come kind rebuild will actually substantial negative effect p&l
capex mainly type debottleneck make different kind smaller change improve efficiency quality forth
pretty much potential kind thing
also little_bit utilize better [ner:date] framework increase little_bit capacity pretty many_of kind idea risk_level pretty low return_opportunity pretty good
major rebuild plan [ner:duration]
regard capacity_utilization obviously continue quite substantially behind competitor status relatively older machine_park would make good sense actually shut_down old machine refocus cash really need operate efficient machine higher rate
yes
true [ner:date] somewhat lower operating_rate competitor [ner:date] big difference
expect quite good operating_rate also [ner:date]
follow-up question
[ner:date] start
see sign consumer_stock towards [ner:date]
order_book weaker [ner:date] ordering strong
could comment would interesting
perhaps take [ner:date] situation order_book_situation bit bit weaker strongest [ner:duration] [ner:date]
kind change whole picture
good level still
compare period [ner:date]
much better
interesting
[ner:date] finally say expect still show small loss lose [ner:number] clean basis comparatively high cost_quarter [ner:date] tend good [ner:ordinal] somewhat higher price
make believe will loss [ner:date] oppose small positive
overall price_situation especially currency_situation
[ner:location] weak level pretty much dollar base business
cost-saving process take time seeable p&l
thank
[ner:person]
[ner:organization]
question actually ask last maybe could extend bit
dollar stabilize even strengthen bit [ner:date] expect [ner:percent] expect mean goodwill_amortization would p&l
cost will go_up q1 know
[ner:ordinal] question
question regard folding boxboard_price see tick_up bit graph q4
mix_issue market_price go towards [ner:date]
yes take overall cost_situation_q4 compare_to q1 major change negative direction
see major increase cost come latex_price oil_derivative_product use paper_product wood_price major change
little bit_freight_price perhaps higher [ner:date] [ner:number]
pretty accurate calculate profitability far price concern
like set price_level will higher end q1 compare_to situation end q4
average price_q4-q1 will big difference
go paperboard paperboard expect think sale_structure folding boxboard_product will major change_q1 compare_to q4
perhaps get little_bit positive affect final closing book paperboard_business
reserve little_bit kind sale_cost
[ner:date] little_bit need so_that revert little_bit kind thing q1_q4 effect minor [ner:number]
[ner:number] additional thing consider q1_result currency hedge impact
remember successful period q4 income derivative relatively good
closing_rate dollar high mean actually q1 will gain hedging_instrument
okay understand
thank
[ner:person]
good afternoon [ner:organization]
[ner:number] question
want come back capex make sure right guidance
say go spend [ner:money] [ner:date] [ner:money] [ner:date]
change prior guidance
perhaps little_bit little_bit worrying estimation
summertime say [ner:date] need [ner:money] think perhaps need [ner:date]
[ner:date] change message exactly like mr._[ner:person] tell [ner:date] [ner:number] amount [ner:date]
history message regard capex_amount
right
okay thank much
[ner:ordinal] bond_amortization due [ner:date] [ner:date]
give update come due
repeat question please
look bond_long-term_debt_amortization [ner:duration] update will appear [ner:set] report come_out please
actually start undrawn credit_facility actually renew [ner:number] facility replace [ner:number]
sense pressure
long-term debt_side totally [ner:date] [ner:date] [ner:number] together
okay
earnings cash_flow improve look like capex will depreciation
will pay_down debt_amortization perhaps service dividend guess worst-case scenario
would envision business_divestiture
list far divestiture concern carton_part carton say plant [ner:number] carton_plant
major thing still divestment_list actual situation study market_situation whether demand kind asset
otherwise divestiture will comprise smaller thing
course clean house seek opportunity divest kind noncore nonproductive asset
major single thing in_addition_to carton_plant
could ask follow-up
[ner:organization] [ner:location] talk pulp_mill [ner:location]
move forward would need contribute capital expansion
perhaps good repeat message regard participation [ner:location]
study positive way opportunity consider positive way capability moment go project
also strategic point view intention increase exposure market_pulp participate interesting project need pre_-lrb-_ph_-rrb-_some_pulp_capacity also make room balance_sheet type big project
consolidate [ner:organization] company possibly make project real get consolidation big part project balance_sheet indebtedness_ratio would risk so_that strategy regard [ner:location]
okay thank
[ner:person] ph
[ner:organization]
wonder cost_inflation_side expect percentage_increase overall cost_base [ner:date] give higher energy_chemical transport_cost
cost_savings_program
talk basic chemical like pigment example long-term contract mean maximum thinkable increase price more_than [ner:percent]
energy_side clear energy_price will go stage rain_most_[ner:set] [ner:location]
respect also think safe side
mr._[ner:person] already tell talk oil-based chemical like latex price_trend [ner:date] downwards upward [ner:date]
percentage [ner:date] whole look [ner:number] [ner:percent]
think average more_than [ner:percent] exclude labor_negotiation still open
typical increase labor
[ner:date] talk [ner:misc] side labor_negotiation part operation already sign contract normally [ner:number] [ner:percent] also sign contract overall cost [ner:number]
wonder capex_side thing work price start move upward prepare finance capex plan increase debt
target
target clearly example [ner:date] development net debt_amount target really increase absolute amount
would hold_back some_of project free cash_flow come operation
yes certain opportunity also speak operate networking_capital forth finance profitable thing
finally uncoated fine paper_market wonder challenging price fall need happen get market turnaround
course kind pretty healthy demand development need [ner:number] major thing need as_well
[ner:number] will help lot kind development [ner:number] pulp_price will go_up
market_pulp_price go upward course help kind process
also important especially speak [ner:misc] market [ner:location] appreciate value [ner:date] level support especially uncoated fine paper_price_increase_process

next_question_come [ner:person] telegraph
yes explain layman person involve financial market tax_situation [ner:location] affect operation [ner:location] particularly [ner:person]
whether tax_situation affect viability operation
let briefly comment would happy talk detail since think people line understand
right
[ner:duration] half ago [ner:location] increase tax_rate make less profitable [ner:location] as_well_as competitor
think best way operate take a_series_of operational change include reduce number [ner:duration] change mix gain as_well_as market
factor result net lower profitability really drive higher tax_rate mitigation action take
look forward industry [ner:location] bring tax back line certainly state think would result win-win situation
would happy call talk
okay thanks
please
next_question_come [ner:person]_[ner:organization]

therefore would expect spend useful life much greater [ner:duration]
yes
yes
laughter
okay
difference [ner:number]
approximately yes
upkeep property
sure
thing like
believe say earlier release think will close_to [ner:percent] want [ner:date]
essentially [ner:percent] [ner:date] exception [ner:organization]
okay
would expect spend rate [ner:number] slot slots-related activity [ner:date] would [ner:date] would different
slightly continue spend capital keep game fresh
okay
find best way generate revenue profitability
would likely lower go_forward almost [ner:percent]
always spend money slot_profit
typically always replace approximately [ner:percent] game [ner:set]
okay
super
thank
time question
thank join
management will [ner:date] additional question please call
thank
conclude [ner:date] [ner:organization]
may [ner:date] disconnect
operator_instruction [ner:ordinal] question_come line_[ner:person] [ner:organization]
[ner:person] question separation
mention complexity may delay timing
question
still feel confident structure transaction term dividend capital business
see delay administrative complexity
[ner:person] nothing_change term expectation timing
timing use word_[ner:duration] use word_quarter
complex transaction
work closely regulator
a_lot_of information impart
work diligently provide information fast humanly possible large volume information analysis go_on
result expect delay initial thought make many [ner:date] many [ner:date] term expectation around timing
[ner:date] get transaction see complexity associate see occur term amount work get make sure everything detail appropriately analyze appropriately
okay
helpful
question expense make sure head wrap around
[ner:person] understand flow strategic expense remainco would imply still another [ner:money] leave balance [ner:date] would come operating corporate
[ner:ordinal] question expense
also [ner:person] want get sense much kind annualize [ner:money] increase expense [ner:date] embed 1q_result
answer [ner:ordinal] question yes
would expect [ner:date]
could share [ner:ordinal] question
quite get
yes
form [ner:number] indicate [ner:person] expect go_up [ner:money] [ner:date] versus [ner:date] level
want understand much planned increase embed 1q_number
small amount
indication much 1q_number
probably [ner:money] q1
[ner:money] annualize basis

[ner:date] build like [ner:money] [ner:set] run_rate
yes
yes
yes
okay
little half
next_question_come_line [ner:person]_[ner:organization]
[ner:ordinal] question regard change make derivative_program expect impact ongoing benefit some_of low interest_rate_hedge would come would come operating_earnings
material change benefit get hedge
course rate higher [ner:date] get less benefit still essentially
okay
material_change interested interest_rate move
secondly come [ner:date] guide [ner:money] corporate loss exclude expense_initiative_cost
outlook_change [ner:date] lower consolidated tax_rate_outlook
yes
expect still within range expect lower tax_rate [ner:date] [ner:date]
next_question_come_line [ner:person]_[ner:organization]
[ner:ordinal] question derivative loss
obviously derivative loss decline significantly 4q still relatively large
little surprised loss interest_rate
rate generally flat lower depend part curve look
wonder cause
related sale some_of hedge position something else
gaap_loss hedge hedge program affect whether effect stat_capital
thing go_on [ner:person]
[ner:ordinal] although [ner:duration] treasury drop little almost flat quarter-to-quarter swap_rate little_bit
noise
asymmetrical noneconomic get [ner:organization]
will also strong equity_market [ner:date] get [ner:organization] as_well
also point_out hedge ineffectiveness [ner:date] impact total [ner:organization]
term change implement assume change swap swaption discuss correct
discuss some_of change make
whether change size hedge_program whether make bigger smaller
actually a_variety_of thing
able get statutory hedge_accounting type derivative change technique structure
move different instrument like accomplish primary goal make stat_capital remainco less sensitive change interest_rate
see number breakout remainco sensitivity across board
term equity relatively insensitive
mean always movement
every time look result [ner:date] lot go_on [ner:duration] derivative as_well_as variable annuity
time_decay derivative
age portfolio
basis_risk know va_hedge_ineffectiveness
get group together
sensitivity go
minimize always will always movement due all_of factor
okay
lastly mention strong sale [ner:location] [ner:location] think [ner:percent]
extent view sort turn sale since result pretty weak [ner:duration] versus maybe front-selling related discount_rate_change go effect [ner:date] [ner:date]
let try
[ner:person]
[ner:location] [ner:percent] year-on-year drive primarily foreign currency_life_sale_growth [ner:percent]
know make shift end_market probably [ner:date] [ner:date] [ner:date]
also strong growth [ner:location] [ner:percent]
foreign currency_business [ner:date] make_up [ner:percent] total life_sale think fairly consistent mix go_forward a_number_of competitor pool life_product change pricing follow reserve_discount_rate_change see customer agency push much towards foreign currency_life_product well position provide give breadth distribution get
see fairly consistent theme
probably benefit around inaudible sale_pre-repricing product reprice [ner:date]
know follow reserve_discount_rate sort financial [ner:duration] will expect sale sector fall_off [ner:date]
overall comfortable term [ner:location]
early sort list guidance sector moment
next_question_come_line [ner:person] [ner:misc]
group_benefits talk competitive environment
see best opportunity
give relatively strong industry result [ner:duration] see uptick price_competition
[ner:person]
[ner:ordinal] want say pleased group_sale result [ner:date]
competitive market
know always competitive
say would_say life disability rational
see little_bit intense competition dental especially downmarket overall feel comfortable market
probably see strong growth strong persistency
able get renewal_action overall rational market
get
[ner:number] thing clarify pace buyback expect slow receive dividend_payment [ner:person]
assume [ner:money] contingent transaction approve
also restriction market around time transaction
anticipate change program put place
exist cash_reserve earnings believe track program complete [ner:date]
next_question_come_line [ner:person]_[ner:organization]
follow_up [ner:person] question around share_repurchase
understand kind bright line_test [ner:organization] could fall [ner:percent] sound like whatever happen hedge loss [ner:date] bring close_to
[ner:percent] apply statutory entity relate remainco
all_of [ner:date] [ner:organization]
well [ner:organization] measure [ner:date] [ner:duration]
confident long-term projection
always know a_lot_of plus minus restructuring unwind reinsurance_transaction see piece move back forth
brighthouse_tentative_[ner:organization] debt_infusion yet
lot move piece look take account strongly capitalize across board business
okay
would great
[ner:organization] result stronger normalize basis would think
mean broadly speak think quarter see favorable equity_market_performance [ner:organization] will runoff quickly guide
well block vas [ner:organization]
favorable equity_market better fee ongoing basis will continue [ner:number] factor
next_question_come_line [ner:person] [ner:location]
question group_insurance_business
[ner:person] long time since remember sort start_off conference_call talk highlight business
give size scale particularly large case_market anything beyond economy scale think could gain large acquisition within business_line
relatedly think see success particularly jumbo case_market
competition decline
get bit aggressive
[ner:person] as_for [ner:ordinal] part question always look opportunity marketplace
group_business [ner:number] favorable view go_forward strong part company many [ner:duration]
opportunity marketplace make accretive acquisition certainly go quite interested look
[ner:person] want take [ner:ordinal] part question
sure
term invest group_insurance think see benefit investment growth
example invest voluntary benefit_platform
see large group as_well_as medium-size group really gravitate toward carrier core_benefit_program offer voluntary benefit employee toward carrier like [ner:organization] position
talk historically benefit example exchange
case nonmedical carrier health_exchange
think go_forward place really put investment ability ensure employee_record secure
a_lot_of work security_platform
helpful market look bring_on new [ner:organization] disability_business as_well
[ner:person] fair say talk really strong growth sale jumbo case_market good chunk actually voluntary employer pay
actually
would_say strong sale_quarter market double-digit growth jumbo market
high single-digit growth regional market know small market actually seasonally [ner:date] focus
even strong growth
growth core_business voluntary business
voluntary business double digit sale_perspective
overall strong sale_quarter group
question [ner:person] change hedging_strategy implement [ner:person] remainco
give sense as_to duration program put place [ner:date]
often some_of hedge need roll
try understand new instrument compare some_of older hedge
sure even still extend [ner:date]
remainco duration basically longer-term hedge mainly
[ner:person] like [ner:number] [ner:duration] type_restructuring hedge
make significant progress get hedging [ner:date]
think [ner:date] sensitivity point_out look form [ner:number] [ner:date] publish sensitivity [ner:organization] as_well_as ulsg see stat [ner:organization] special sensitivity go_forward
understand disclosure
try understand duration maybe risk roll
[ner:person] [ner:duration]
next_question_come_line [ner:person]_[ner:organization]
want start stat_capital
guess [ner:money] year-end despite take_any_dividend_out
[ner:person] walk mechanic term capital
[ner:money] [ner:money]
say [ner:organization]
restructuring cause less sensitivity reserve
total cte95 really hedge strategy still buffer take account transaction will happen
pro_forma_basis as_of [ner:date] see partway restructuring step happen
see sort low point say script significantly [ner:date]
would whole series transaction happen get
give sort pro_forma_view expect like [ner:number] [ner:number] [ner:organization] as_if happen as_of [ner:date]
okay
another question update form [ner:number]
[ner:number] change debt-to-capital [ner:person] [ner:date] go [ner:percent] cte95_buffer go guess around [ner:money]
discuss [ner:number] drive [ner:number] change
[ner:ordinal] form [ner:number] calculation value as_well_as core_assumption projection as_of [ner:date]
update form [ner:number] as_of [ner:date] thing change lot [ner:date] [ner:date]
a_series_of change think [ner:person] will dynamic company manage business reason
still strongly capitalized will provide good value time shareholder
okay
[ner:number] last clarification_question could [ner:percent] roe_target [ner:person] guidance sort out_of gate
longer-term expectation
think happen [ner:location] next little type range because_of kind gaap_work key focus build_up time reduce hedging_cost start get cash out_of company
key focus run mainly statutory basis
final question [ner:date] come_line [ner:person]_[ner:organization]
follow_up [ner:person] question regard kind appetite group_market_acquisition
give capital_position like size transaction will comfortable without kind seek external capital
[ner:person] well [ner:ordinal] certainly will capital reserve acquisition
please remember acquisition larger size like [ner:organization] deal back [ner:date] [ner:organization] [ner:date]
would access capital_market fund necessary beyond hold hold company important reiterate philosophy acquisition
make sense strategically term plan company go_forward direction business want
[ner:ordinal] accretive shareholder create shareholder_value
earn cost capital point time acquisition_opportunity will look capital_market would cost raise capital kind return would expect acquisition include synergy make determination term willing pay business
get
housekeeping question update regard dividend_stopper debt_cost [ner:date]
well believe will factor go_forward
step take need adjust
something plan need execute
time question
will [ner:date] turn call back mr._[ner:person]
thank everybody will talk throughout [ner:date]
goodbye

conclude conference [ner:date]
thank participation use [ner:organization]
may [ner:date] disconnect
operator_instruction [ner:ordinal] question_come line_[ner:person] [ner:organization]
maybe guidance_front sound like [ner:money] beat [ner:date] really reason guy raise low end
mean core see assumption change guidance
anything behind [ner:money] beat relative expectation
well relative expectation talk think [ner:date] accelerate vesting would roughly [ner:money] share wind_up [ner:money] share [ner:money]
actually round probably like little [ner:money] share differential
part operation part income
okay
nothing significant enough push either occupancy_assumption same-store
juncture
mean think mean same-store report kind middle range
think still comfortable range update
little [ner:date]
something will continue evaluate go [ner:date]
overall look [ner:date] range [ner:date] come_out feel comfortable increase bottom end range [ner:money]
maybe will add little
look core exceed core rent_performance guide [ner:date]
rent good [ner:date]
strong volume [ner:date]
terrific
a_bit_of uptick occupancy relatively candidly consistent think would happen [ner:date]
[ner:person] walk_you_through mean anomaly [ner:set] sometimes favor sometimes
[ner:number] thing would maybe higher end range
let let little_bit [ner:date] go will decide whether want revise assumption core
clearly comfortable feeling [ner:date] better [ner:date] in_than think go term revise_the_low_end_up
fair
guess [ner:number] thing see peer guy pretty good retention_rate occupancy [ner:date] even though push rate harder
curious conversation guy [ner:date] amount pushback get tenant rent increase versus maybe ability push even harder [ner:date] go_on maintain occupancy
yes
yes great question
fact recall [ner:date] think [ner:percent] retention forget [ner:percent] [ner:percent] rent_increase
like sort perfect right
keep good customer charge whole lot
sort work
answer many_of market customer a_lot_of option
get always like talk big number market big vacancy_rate much end granular
real question [ner:number] square-foot customer lease come option renew place move
many [ner:number] square-foot space submarket
none
[ner:number] [ner:number]
quite want plus cost move
would_say almost across board conversation would prefer see rent go clearly understand market kind play_out
yes
okay
helpful
[ner:number] clarification
new supp way look good
curious page [ner:number] [ner:number] same-store versus fully stabilize exclude fully kind give color fully stabilize really reflect
fully stabilize intend incorporate same-store plus property would shell-complete as_of [ner:number] [ner:date] would subsequently stabilize
look reconciliation back definition could see breakout same-store add adjustment fully stabilize property would stabilize since [ner:date]
something intend continue update go [ner:date] evaluate new property stabilize go throughout [ner:date]
next_question_come_line [ner:person]_[ner:organization]
[ner:person] thanks guy thanks commentary transaction_market
a_couple_of question relate
guy stand [ner:money] [ner:money] disposition guidance
[ner:duration] [ner:number] mention a_lot_of class_b_product market
make less inclined add product sale_pool
good question think lot [ner:date] market
will take crack [ner:person] want add
still comfortable [ner:money] [ner:money]
recall quite batch funding concept get development_pipeline go pay
create capital_need
acquisition_target would like see could

particular quarter even though [ner:location] example [ner:percent] industrial portfolio significant move exchange_rate think like [ner:money] dollar [ner:date]
recall drop_off pretty significantly [ner:date] [ner:date]
impact
happen couple item go direction [ner:date]
something would anticipate will continue
will probably see some_of [ner:location] [ner:date] less pronounced average would come [ner:date] [ner:date]
maybe broader picture
look lease_expiration_schedule industrial portfolio generally speak [ner:percent] come due exclude [ner:date] way given [ner:duration]

even though spread [ner:percent] hit enough lease get growth post growth [ner:percent] growth

explain investment strategic rationale deal
mean certainly outside_of core_market
southern_[ner:location] fundamental certainly healthy also super competitive ample amount supply [ner:location]
explain rationale thought invest market go_forward would good hear perspective
[ner:person] slowly grow probably little [ner:number] square foot [ner:date]
opportunity present buy entitle piece land
[ner:location]
building [ner:number] square foot
comfortable deal_size active [ner:date]
put ground buy ground think [ner:date] put production [ner:date]
think will selectively try would agree expensive play_out
would love grow asset_base selectively try prudently try add investment_base
next_question_come_line [ner:person] jpmorgan
couple_office_question
[ner:ordinal] notable change office_demand across portfolio market say [ner:date]
office_demand
would_say office_demand [ner:location] consistent
submarket always little_bit variability
probably somewhat prospects market [ner:date]
think think opening_comment talk little_bit sort general environment positive optimism pro-business world think people execute against
see [ner:location] sure
[ner:location]
think originally [ner:person] like [ner:duration] buildout
last building construction within less_than [ner:number] [ner:number] maybe
people really sort will use term sort consume product pretty rapidly so_that think still good prospect_activity
[ner:location] think little_bit little_bit wait see
mean obviously lot go_on [ner:location] [ner:date] shake_out yet little_bit know
fact manifest [ner:organization] go long-term
huge player market
get clearly sense maybe defense_and_security_firm might growth_space
[ner:location] decent tech_activity
always place organization need lobby pay_attention happen [ner:location] seem like active time pay attention happen [ner:location]
think also little_bit wait see
would put little_bit less robust
say soft
say less robust [ner:number] mention
okay
[ner:number] last question
look wholly market
[ner:number] market office_side
take guess [ner:duration] [ner:date] think number similar
smaller
potentially even
will smaller
simple answer
yes part would like transparent get
tell example [ner:location] single well actually [ner:number] asset
guess [ner:number] work contract [ner:person]
correct
[ner:number] contract sell asset large facility 40-acre right
approximately
approximately 40-acre site literally go put new transit_station part new mass_transit_line
hold property believe bigger redevelopment talk liberty could somebody else might well get up-zoned
sell part disposition [ner:location]
sort bulk sit
[ner:location] thing a_couple_of asset move some_of flex
yes mean a_couple_of asset may stay long-term
[ner:location] single building get lease would office_market [ner:location]
will shrink
will less market
asset various reason need get lease_up redevelopment play_out will
next_question_come_line [ner:person] [ner:person]
[ner:person]
question
subject shrink go great explanation good explanation [ner:location] go great explanation [ner:location] question ask really worth go_forward keep
[ner:number] question
[ner:ordinal] question [ner:person] great job [ner:organization]
much fix cap_rate expect full disclosure [ner:organization] bump_up people [ner:organization] per share analysis
[ner:ordinal] guess sure office_world happen see demonstrative trend towards turnkey_tenant_improvement pay move cost buy_up rental rate capital
relatively unique position [ner:number] office_industrial_reit leave
see trend towards excessive capital_cost buy_up rental rate industrial business
okay
will [ner:ordinal] yes will [ner:ordinal] [ner:ordinal] will turn_it_over [ner:person]_[ner:organization]
[ner:person]
[ner:location]
right mean lay_it_out go repeat sort see
think number [ner:number] industrial side actually complicate extension industrial side
fact [ner:number] customer within domestic portfolio
actually run customer
think synergistic
think problem
think reason land_development_issue
supply-constrained market almost supply-constrained country
healthy-type market like think provide growth
land_development_part business entitlement_and_planning_consent something learn
positive reputation
team
never really send capital side
fact send indicate send return back
think make a_lot_of sense leverage get return get handsome strong
think something get candidly [ner:person] kind expertise activity execute think difficult monetize
monetize building land really capability
think really good plan keep portfolio
question turnkey_industrial interesting question
right
part happen know happen construction_cost go ti become expensive become little_bit shock sometimes customer look
would_say industrial side though generally customer fairly minimal look term core look office break_room restroom et_cetera
customer come start expand [ner:date] start talk could give could help put mezz
could help put_in word part business_operation view consistent intrinsic value asset
candidly go able rent necessarily next time around
basically stop

generally kind work_out generally people take ti kind base_package speak
invest forward
[ner:person]
yes
[ner:person] might see little someone merchant-build mentality
high-credit tenant come need mezzanine_space testing thing somebody might willing finance within lease know will turn around flip building get much higher rental face_rental_rate get cap
mean marketplace
[ner:person] want talk nav_question
yes sure
[ner:person]_[ner:organization] mean try [ner:date] component
hopefully will get truer computation [ner:organization] particularly item transition
go transition development_property operate property might fully stabilize operation yet transition back redevelopment type thing as_well_as break_out tangible asset liability
hopeful information helpful folk actually come_up true calculation estimate nav
quick follow-up
[ner:person]
help people nav [ner:money] share [ner:money] share
ask question explicably
[ner:person] job
well already know answer want see know answer
go_ahead
go say yes know struggle generally gather information thing simple fully stabilize nuance transition different category
really try achieve
[ner:person] follow-up mention excessive ti excess project_cost merchant_builder
explain sort number behind [ner:location]
okay [ner:person]
okay
yes
next_question_come_line [ner:person] [ner:person]
[ner:number] quick one
[ner:ordinal] [ner:number] [ner:organization] give shift regulation [ner:organization] cable_company see change like view gross prospects [ner:date] maybe change time_line development [ner:ordinal] site
well time_line [ner:ordinal] site
look large company many thing many space
obviously core_cable_business obviously enter entertainment_world universal
ceo [ner:person] often say view company technology_company term go able connection place connect provide term platform roll_out various technology
talk get cellphone_business mobile phone add hard line [ner:misc] tv
think company much think growth could manifest lot_of way let see happen
get
helpful
next_question [ner:organization] deal company like [ner:location]
find focus price geographic location therefore little less price-sensitive
well let respond [ner:location] always protect confidentiality customer
ask interesting question generically
let talk generically
company will go market rfp_basis build-to-suit price-sensitive
fact might even want show picture building go look like
might want nothing fill_out rent_comp grid go make decision better rent_comp go see
people often generally locationally agnostic say [ner:location] somewhere need [ner:location] somewhere
let decide go charge base_on whatever land get hand
people specific logistic requirement logistical requirement could consumer_product_person make decision draw circle say need building within [ner:number] mile center circle [ner:location] need building somewhere [ner:location] wherever
could e-commerce_person last mile say way need travel_time hit [ner:location] need [ner:location] need [ner:location] need next_to o'hare something like
control site prone control price need site trump everything already decide logistical reason
may well liberty often build-to-suit will actually higher yield will spec development counterintuitive people think risk_profile
reason happen situation location control solution customer happy solve problem price think representative return get investment site control
totally game point [ner:person] make [ner:date] merchant_builder [ner:organization] reit [ner:organization] probably somebody go win basis build building turn_around strong market sell [ner:number] [ner:number] basis_point better yield get

business_model therefore will get deal happy get deal
consistent try
next_question_come_line [ner:person]_[ner:organization]
could comment maybe new supply_picture market maybe specifically [ner:location]
know broker report probably split market [ner:number] different market
maybe little detail like percentage [ner:location] versus [ner:location]
look seem like supply grow lot
realize media_company like majestic control a_lot_of supply maybe disciplined maybe little better picture happen market
yes yes
yes take some_of source [ner:date] will tell [ner:number] square foot construction
name [ner:number] market central_pa [ner:location]
actually [ner:ordinal] market sort [ner:location] [ner:number]
people give number take wider geography [ner:organization] will sort think core [ner:location] core [ner:location]
[ner:date] go submarket submarket [ner:location] [ner:number] square-foot market term quality_nav_product
[ner:number] square foot construction [ner:date] [ner:percent] pre-leased
much candidly [ner:number] building [ner:number] [ner:number] thanks [ner:person]
peer building like [ner:number]
[ner:number] building
entire construction available unleased inventory [ner:location]
hard-to-find site people go periphery_site
[ner:organization] away run issue like labor thing
site moment interested
[ner:location] [ner:date] [ner:number]
central_pa submarket [ner:number] square foot [ner:number] square foot construction [ner:date]
[ner:percent] pre-leased
building many
way [ner:location] [ner:date] [ner:percent] vacant
people think will break [ner:percent] [ner:date]
tight
central_pa like [ner:percent]
people think could go [ner:percent] [ner:percent] [ner:duration]
think over-building either [ner:number] submarket anybody concern
operator_instruction next_question_come_line [ner:person]_[ner:organization]
[ner:ordinal] comment land_bank general compositional land_bank
start creep_up little_bit term overall value
want get understanding plan monetize go_forward
yes yes
[ner:date] [ner:person] get [ner:number] acre wholly maybe another [ner:number] acre jv
make_up [ner:number] acre make_up land_inventory
capable develop [ner:number] [ner:number] square foot development various depend obviously land et_cetera
some_of land try actually market
actually long-term interest hold might try sell
could represent [ner:number] acre [ner:number] acre course [ner:date]
let see happen
also obviously [ner:person] indicate pretty strong development_market build-to-suits work et_cetera
could land some_of will eat_up inventory part
get little_bit kind bounce
market out_of land totally open consider acquisition see potential development whereas place land build_out
see [ner:date] [ner:location] new development start actually new site acquire [ner:person] yes
[ner:date] roughly
infill site think make a_lot_of sense
great success [ner:ordinal] infill_site add
whereas building start [ner:location] long-term development_project [ner:location]
still pad [ner:person] part inventory
degree successful [ner:number] inventory_building [ner:location]
surprise go start another [ner:number]
settle [ner:person] piece ground [ner:location] [ner:date] [ner:date] [ner:date] commence commence construction
will happen relatively quickly
generally would_say will generally trend partially sale_activity partially build_out some_of
related [ner:location] fair say some_of pre-leasing activity post-quarter end [ner:location] development_pipeline



oh okay
okay
follow-up question maybe [ner:person]
balance_sheet_goal
certainly seem go net investor [ner:date] assume issue equity leverage go creep_up
balance_sheet_target
obviously sort confidence credit_rating credit_rating_agency satisfy leverage_level
think creep head head lower point
think obviously comfortable balance_sheet [ner:date]
pay_down a_lot_of debt [ner:date]
lay_out [ner:date] least near-term plan
sit look [ner:money] [ner:money] [ner:duration] development maybe couple [ner:money] acquisition would likely look match-fund acquisition sale likely fund maybe [ner:percent] [ner:percent] development_pipeline sale officially either either available cash operation net dividend and/or borrowing namely line credit term time kind think balance_sheet_standpoint
start [ner:date] [ner:number] line obviously [ner:money] capacity
certainly let creep_up
maturity unsecured note [ner:date]
ample flexibility sale operate cash_flow think will kind manage around balance_sheet way
try keep net debt-to-ebitda_south [ner:number] yes mean net debt-to-ebitda come [ner:number] [ner:date]
obviously run [ner:set] basis even little_bit lower [ner:date]
try keep lever number [ner:number] keep leverage probably around [ner:percent] plus minus
6x_debt-to-ebitda_target still go still go target even industrial portfolio less office presumably industrial will lower cap_rate
yes mean think look
mean balance right
sit look leverage debt-to-ebitda try keep range could bbb type credit
try strike right balance make sure preserve credit_rating
question time
would like turn call back management additional close remark
well thanks everybody listen
appreciate talk [ner:date]
thanks
thank participate [ner:date] conference_call
may [ner:date] disconnect line time
operator_instruction [ner:ordinal] question_come [ner:person]_[ner:organization]
want start [ner:location]
trend relative expectation far [ner:date]
still expect same-store revenue_growth [ner:location] [ner:percent]
yes [ner:person]
would_say really right on_top_of expectation
would true market as_well
nickel worth difference end_up [ner:date] original guidance
give specific guidance [ner:location] think [ner:date] would sort low water_mark
still think likely true
give specific guidance [ner:percent] revenue
base_on everything see see [ner:date] think still right place [ner:location] [ner:date]
term store_revenue_growth broadly
know maintain guidance peak leasing_season maintain component as_well_that expect [ner:number] basis_point guess lower occupancy [ner:date] [ner:number] basis_point_benefit bulk internet_rollout
correct
think try get midpoint guidance sound like need see rent_growth throughout [ner:date] [ner:percent]
think [ner:date] come slightly
give amount supply see deliver [ner:date] give comfort term reach midpoint maintain rent_growth see [ner:date]
think go hit midpoint would change guidance
pretty good shape
mean full bottom-up reforecast_market market
detail approach
fortunate a_ton_of people market company many many [ner:duration]
get take great comfort
think kind big picture deceleration [ner:location] model basically offset improvement [ner:location] [ner:location] kind weighted average number percentage_concentration [ner:location] versus [ner:location] math [ner:number] market basically push [ner:date]
beyond get a_bunch_of market still continue see really good growth [ner:location] [ner:location] [ner:location] grow extremely well [ner:location]
still see pretty good strength across platform
guess would go back original guidance give letter_grade would change single [ner:number]
give [ner:date] [ner:number] market grade stable
[ner:number] improve [ner:location] [ner:location] balance decline
would change
say think still feel like good shape get midpoint guidance_range same-store noi
next_question_come [ner:location] [ner:organization]
[ner:ordinal] want touch [ner:location] little_bit occupancy_benefit [ner:date]
wonder view [ner:date] revenue_growth trend
would expect moderate bit give occupancy_benefit
additional color could provide pricing_power market head peak leasing_season would helpful
yes really good quarter line plan
slightly better noi overall really line expect see
strength occupancy carry_over certainly carry_over [ner:date] [ner:location]
see great traffic
folk optimistic commentary go_on market [ner:duration] [ner:location]
positive
[ner:percent] growth revenue [ner:date] certainly good start
think likely see part trend carry_out throughout [ner:date]
[ner:location] market rate improve
look like look like good shape achieve
great
want touch [ner:location] quickly
guy outline [ner:number] job [ner:number] new unit market
compare [ner:duration] [ner:date] think [ner:date] perhaps [ner:date] maybe same-store revenue [ner:percent]
curious job completion_ratio look like prior [ner:number] period see similar revenue_growth_decline project guidance
well probably lot worse
in_front_of [ner:number] prior period really significant job_loss [ner:location]
much different scenario deal [ner:date]
thing economy [ner:location] [ner:number] previous period fundamentally weaker anything see downturn
downturn almost exclusively limit standpoint job oil_business
really ever spread_over part [ner:location]
feel like happen apartment [ner:location] feel like good place
absent oil_patch process pretty robust recovery term price oil drilling_activity across all_of major mid major company
[ner:location] even though apartment_sector weak primarily supply-induced weakness [ner:date] market clear expect happen sometime [ner:date] get glut apartment find resident find home_and_market_rent go adjustment happen already process happen [ner:location] really well poise recovery economics will immediately spillover better support rental rate
different
would_say term supply similar job worse
economy feel like throughout [ner:number] prior period recession
tell feel like anything close [ner:location] term overall economic impact
say get [ner:number] apartment work way term delivery [ner:duration] [ner:date]
yes
let add a_couple_of point [ner:location] bit
look apartment_side equation obviously office probably office much worse apartment lease apartment apartment great price_elasticity
lower price fill_up apartment people need place live
need place work job job people fill job
[ner:date] [ner:location] [ner:duration] add [ner:number] new resident
[ner:number] people come abroad [ner:number] people come [ner:location] domestically
add natural birth_rate population_increase [ner:duration] [ner:date] [ner:number] people
inertia [ner:number] people live region
start actually completion [ner:percent] [ner:date] [ner:date] [ner:date]
will [ner:percent] [ner:date] [ner:date] [ner:date]
time [ner:duration] [ner:date] job_number somewhere around [ner:number] job
look actually produce job [ner:date] anybody_thought would happen
end still get supply_issue
good news manageable start look forward
fair say big difference level concession new supply
absolutely
competitive market_from_a_lease_up perspective energy_patch urban core [ner:duration] free
worst thing merchant_builder last [ner:number] get [ner:duration] free right
pretty much cap generally tend go much
think [ner:duration] free take [ner:money] rent [ner:money] [ner:money] something like increase ability customer pay
happen boom people want live highrise really great urban location
consumer really well [ner:date]
get option price great
[ner:duration] free translate occupied market though
look [ner:percent] projection [ner:number] occupy like merchant_builder open door willing cut price level
also a_lot_of product high-end product biggest problem rental high end
suburban location much better urban location
kind versus urban versus suburban kind story typical kind cycle
put number around [ner:person] commentary [ner:duration] free [ner:percent] rental decline merchant_builder market market [ner:date]
try different task
try get little occupancy something stabilize
portfolio end_up at_if end_up within range think will somewhere around [ner:percent] revenue [ner:date] mix flat
get believe still asset positive revenue_growth [ner:date]
big slight positive number
get [ner:percent] ask price number probably high
[ner:percent] ask price rent market_clearing_number
think kind end_up
end_up last [ner:number] cycle
will slug_it_out think achieve give guidance [ner:location] better [ner:duration] ahead [ner:location] dynamic place continue attract people domestically internationally as_well_as embedded growth population
think get clear [ner:number] apartment
next_question [ner:person]_[ner:organization]
wonder comment new versus renewal lease_growth 1q [ner:location] trend 2q
yes
[ner:date] [ner:location] renewal would flat new lease [ner:percent] plus minus
carry_over [ner:date]
think project balance [ner:date] get something less_than [ner:percent] revenue probably go pretty close_to flat try maintain flat renewal
overall lease come_down maybe [ner:percent] [ner:percent] end_up [ner:date] [ner:percent]
think likely will see next couple [ner:date] sure
get back half [ner:date] may get little better run little easier comp
some_of concession take rent already occur [ner:ordinal] [ner:date] comp get little_bit easier
directionally think head
wonder could also comment negative revenue_growth [ner:location] [ner:date]
maybe break midtown_asset versus asset maybe near energy_corridor suburb
yes sure
midtown_asset urban core would [ner:percent] [ner:percent] new lease roughly flat renewal
go_out market new lease trend flat [ner:percent]
big spread suburban asset urban core sure part cycle [ner:date] strategy diversify urban asset suburban asset actually help quite bit
next_question [ner:location] [ner:organization]
kind use segue urban versus suburban talk split portfolio whole same-store rent_trend see [ner:number] supply look look forward [ner:number] different segment portfolio
yes supply will start pretty straightforward
give number go guess order magnitude [ner:number] much supply come urban core suburban market across platform
large urban core_problem term supply
get out_of suburb city market like [ner:location] large spread_out unless somebody happen build right next door go kind impact large aggregation lease
term spread suburban versus urban asset suburban asset outperform [ner:percent] urban asset
across [ner:location] entire universe
[ner:location]
supply_challenge get new construction go_on market predominantly urban core
show_up spread way way [ner:duration] term outperformance [ner:percent] suburban versus urban
go back [ner:duration] [ner:number] straight [ner:duration] urban outperform suburban
kind cycle
[ner:percent] same-store revenue
correct
overall split urban suburban sorry whole portfolio
will get number
[ner:number] [ner:number] suburban urban will get exact number
okay
supply
guy think across portfolio [ner:date] versus [ner:date]
see slippage delivery_time_frame [ner:date] could leak [ner:date]
slippage delivery_time every market every sub_market
single merchant_builder talk folk [ner:misc] experience degree case pretty material delay
enough worker
enough construction_worker get job concurrently
go continue challenge
think [ner:person] know [ner:person] [ner:number] [ner:number] datum_provider
actually try incorporate longer construction/lease-up period forecasting multifamily completion
well capture think time will tell
portfolio look across [ner:location] market [ner:date] use [ner:person] number get completion_number across market [ner:number] [ner:date]
get drop [ner:number] [ner:date] forecast
[ner:percent] decline total completion
job_growth estimate across entire portfolio get job_growth [ner:date] [ner:number] across [ner:location]
get tick [ner:number] [ner:date]
number roughly equilibrium [ner:date] completion versus job_number
[ner:date] still many completion job
mean get really strong job_number [ner:time] maybe beginning trend
know fact [ner:location] market attract higher national average percentage get job_growth
next_question_come [ner:person] [ner:person]
continue supply_thing topic
recent conference talk private developer
say some_of big merchant_guy talk_down [ner:percent] reduction start
[ner:person] sound like supply_number hear say correctly sound like [ner:date] different [ner:date]
give update guy hear merchant_developer think supply expect decline think come [ner:duration]
sure
anecdotal information get largest merchant_builder talk thing lower number start
lower number start a_couple_of reason [ner:number] challenge get bank_financing give market
part issue stress finance get construction_loan get less construction_loan expensive cost
total cost capital go_up require equity mezz lending bridge gap
part issue
part issue because_of delay finish project able sell project
certain amount sort cap
cap need sell proper project new project
even though see number come feel like get come base_on discussion folk
[ner:person] look completion [ner:number] thing conversation merchant_builder [ner:date] book business guy probably likely thinking term go permit
look permit project [ner:date] [ner:date] [ner:date] axiometric number go [ner:date]
[ner:percent] almost [ner:percent] permit across [ner:location] entire platform start get range hear merchant_builder talk
okay helpful
switch go_out [ner:location]
guy announce [ner:location]
sort since hear much [ner:location]
sort give update market
[ner:number] purchase because_of yield relative may let say [ner:location]
something see [ner:location] make want put money work
well course market development_folk scour market try get figure deal work
difficult process
project merchant_builder yield start [ner:number] low [ner:number]
challenge
go go
[ner:location] unique opportunity market_transaction seller property little complicated structure
happy able
think [ner:location] [ner:location] real well
great [ner:location] lease_they_up create a_lot_of value
really like [ner:location] really like site market
compete developer really good
versus low [ner:number] yield yield look
well think either high [ner:number] low [ner:number]
next_question_come [ner:person] [ner:person]
talk little_bit south_[ner:location] see market different performance various submarket [ner:date]
overall [ner:location] plan think would
still still get challenge a_lot_of highrise_product build
fortunately stuff build pro_forma_rent bring market [ner:money] plus per square foot
get a_couple_of highrise midst reposition think ultimately will competitive new product
bulk stuff [ner:location] garden low rise mid-rise product
totally different price_point new supply
help certain extent
think original guesstimate [ner:date] [ner:location] stable
[ner:location] stable
still think sound right base_on [ner:ordinal] [ner:duration] operation
think reasonably well position hit plan [ner:date] market
okay
[ner:location]
mean continue strength multifamily guy
see
material_differentiation various submarket guy
portfolio spread_out [ner:location] unlike [ner:location] smaller
great [ner:date] [ner:location]
believe [ner:ordinal] [ner:ordinal] highest rate market [ner:date]
stable
still think right
still [ner:percent] occupy [ner:date]
think [ner:location] little [ner:percent] revenue_growth [ner:date] pretty track plan
get supply go issue [ner:location] [ner:date] [ner:location]
a_lot_of stuff bring market [ner:date]
probably go deal some_of supply_challenge [ner:location]
good mix [ner:location] suburban market ought serve well [ner:location]
next_question_come drew_[ner:person] [ner:person]
quick portfolio_management_question
talk [ner:date] bottom call [ner:percent] portfolio candidate pruning given [ner:duration]
amount cash balance_sheet change thinking with_regard_to whether sell asset maybe think put update capital

clearly cash balance_sheet best balance_sheet multifamily land [ner:date]
happy give cycle
go continue manage portfolio time
probably will go see [ner:money] sale like [ner:date] think kind_of hit market right perfect time sell older asset
will continue play trade think since [ner:date] sell [ner:money] asset roughly little [ner:number] affo_yield
think relative acquire develop negative spread acquisition disposition give sell 20-plus-year-old asset high capex negative spread [ner:number] basis_point trade
will tell business_career see spread tight [ner:date]
continue will
think acquisition [ner:money] disposition [ner:money] acquisition none [ner:duration] [ner:date]
mostly put money development get much better spread development_side equation
negative spread actually positive spread probably [ner:number] [ner:number] basis_point trade
will continue prune portfolio
get sort low-hanging fruit finish
[ner:number] thing think sort watch think supply_side amount merchant_builder_product develop [ner:date] [ner:duration] rise construction_cost see happen [ner:date] think think go happen go_forward development_spread profit developer narrow pretty dramatically
go able acquire property potentially go_forward replacement_cost
merchant_builder in_order reload portfolio go sell asset
already start see little_bit come market
think idea sell older property buy newer property small sort negative spread will old versus new something go continue
helpful
maybe next tier portfolio_asset necessarily sale candidate want portfolio might see directional pickup [ner:misc]
reposition asset pretty aggressively [ner:duration]
get another pool asset start reposition [ner:date]
anything level [ner:number] [ner:date] will continue look opportunity put capital back asset make make sense view long term hold
guess portfolio [ner:person] mention stuff want sell sell [ner:date]
exit [ner:location] sell [ner:money]
sell another [ner:money] asset across entire platform
represent asset see upside sufficient upside reposition
because_of age capex_requirement need become someone else someone else portfolio
stuff want sell get real aggressive sell [ner:date]
next_question_come [ner:person] btig
[ner:number] question regard [ner:location] really outlook [ner:date]
4q_call characterize kind expectation [ner:location] [ner:date] perhaps equilibrium although perhaps optimism could stronger
comment [ner:duration] think comment job_growth [ner:location] create job expect
look happen everybody expect course permit collapse low [ner:date]
make sure understand correctly incrementally positive forecast would_say forecast sense [ner:location] would [ner:date]
perhaps little optimistic achieve perhaps equilibrium equilibrium plus
think number come_in [ner:date] definitely better expect
start definitely fall_off edge earth
surprise in-migration number
generally speak people move market unless think get job
widely know across [ner:location] [ner:location] issue energy_business yet still great in-migration
guess real question will yes positive [ner:location] because_of [ner:date] in-migration number
hand [ner:duration] make [ner:date] make [ner:number] unit need absorb absorb
guardedly optimistic probably little_bit optimistic go [ner:date]
still see play_out
oil_price [ner:duration] even though oil_company add job little_bit job back dramatically think could surprise people upside [ner:date]
hand go wait see obviously
agree
think overall economy mention earlier feel like big big dislocation economy [ner:location]
really kind contain oil_and_gas_sector
bleed_over people apartment people office_building
rest work public people man street go [ner:set] routine [ner:location] [ner:location] seem restaurant full traffic everywhere feel like crazy time [ner:location]
boom_time still robust healthy overall economic standpoint
think [ner:person] point in-migration mean potentially game_changer
get [ner:number] people show_up
somehow another work way economy whether show_up stats
get place live
likely go fair high percentage will end_up rent something make permanent decision anything [ner:location]
think probably upside see continue throughout [ner:date] [ner:date]
probably get enough people slosh around go find way employment need apartment ultimately get [ner:number] plus minus unit [ner:date] [ner:date]
think probably upside
next_question [ner:person] capital [ner:number]
will limit [ner:location] [ner:number]
guess think cadence year-over-year comp same-store trend [ner:date] expect mean know talk [ner:date] bottom potentially [ner:date] get better
look [ner:set] timing_perspective expect inflection_point occur per_se
guess say context guy actually positive same-store noi_comp q4 [ner:date]
set_up exceedingly hard comp optically guy [ner:date]
yes pick inflection_point [ner:date] [ner:location]
see [ner:percent] [ner:date]
think still go able keep [ner:date]
think still feel pretty good keep contain [ner:percent] level
give readout progress will see
a_lot_of volatility around merchant_builder direct comp set happen
merchant_builder get close_to [ner:percent] number [ner:duration] free become [ner:duration] free [ner:time]
different world
people reach get closer stabilization behavior_change pretty dramatically
good embedded base portfolio
far read_out mean think would go say point still think [ner:number] [ner:date] look like bottom
[ner:number] thing think interesting people use sort job completion_ratio guide
use job ratio guide [ner:date] [ner:date] [ner:location] [ner:number] job
[ner:duration] absorb [ner:number] unit wait [ner:duration] [ner:number] job absorb [ner:number] unit
ratio make sense obviously
happen period [ner:date] [ner:location] [ner:number] job [ner:duration] straight [ner:date] [ner:date] [ner:date] [ner:date] [ner:date]
happen momentum large market take_up a_lot_of absorption marketplace
question inflection will continue happen migration better-than-expected job_growth
anybody guess go happen
will happen
know
get
regard expense_side equation obviously guy expense_pressure sequentially year-over-year comp
appear limit [ner:number] market
mean several market kind trend long-term level
could maybe talk little_bit property_tax utility property_insurance guy see trend cadence-wise [ner:date]
yes absolutely
property_tax_side think [ner:date] go end_up [ner:percent]
think [ner:date]
still think true [ner:date]
obviously sequential basis tough comp get quite a_bit_of property_tax_refund [ner:date] particularly [ner:location]
look insurance_side talk last call [ner:date] get refund approximately [ner:money]
way insurance_refund allocate across entire portfolio
certainly negatively impact comparison quarter-over-quarter basis
utility part increase drive rollout tech_package
[ner:date] tech_package think [ner:number] same-store unit get [ner:number] roll_out
start see impact expense_side decline go throughout [ner:date]
get helpful
last question know small portion portfolio
[ner:person] could remind go_on
think say low student_housing_asset
kind genesis investment
see asset long term portfolio
ask specifically student_housing_asset
[ner:ordinal] show_up same-store pool
oh
okay

[ner:number] asset store_[ner:number] [ner:number] asset same-store pool [ner:number] wholly-owned asset separate [ner:location] student_housing_product
student_housing_product great better plan far [ner:date]
part show_up number
decline [ner:location] primarily because_of hit oil_patch definitely affect [ner:location]
particular asset [ner:person] process pretty major exterior_renovation messy
hard drive right kind traffic close percentage need
small piece get attention deserve
think some_of market_condition some_of [ner:date] particular [ner:number] asset
[ner:number] asset same-store pool go pretty volatile around quarter quarter
next_question wes_golladay [ner:organization]
give view development_cost inflation [ner:duration]
already hear lumber_tariff potentially happen
infrastructure_bill implement will labor_cost
yes concerned labor_cost timber_cost lumber_cost
challenge think kind infrastructure_bill government talk look [ner:date] print [ner:number] unemployment_rate tough deal
see benefit [ner:number] thing think [ner:location] construction_cost come_down [ner:location] even though construction fall multifamily offset public sector_spending hospital_spending petrochemical_spending
think go continue pressure big pressure labor_shortage product_shortage especially government get infrastructure_bill [ner:date]
okay
want go back comment [ner:location] get [ner:percent] lease-up back_off concession
particular development_company particular project really compress market price_setter
[ner:date] get lease_up might see little relief
think
think across board
like like tongue-in-cheek comment earlier worst thing merchant_builder last guy get [ner:duration] free
immediately go fast
thing happen [ner:date] market stabilize
[ner:number] particular owner
dispersed group merchant_builder
might inaudible world a_lot_of project control market [ner:number] group really
pretty broad competitive set
really submarket specific
get [ner:number] new lease-up within 1-mile radius property try get lease_up go competitive get stabilize
will run really hard exit will kind_of smash door time
good news run really hard exit
think really good news price_elasticity great
consumer [ner:location] [ner:location] field_[ner:duration] lease_up
a_lot_of_the_product_that_be_build_and_we_be_talk_highrise_that_never_exist_in_a_lot_of_submarket_here_,_and_those_highrise good better sale_condo product see
open sudden cricket
[ner:number] walk door
ton_of people walk door lease_these_up consumer get great deal
[ner:number] concern move [ner:percent] discount fast move_that_up customer whether customer move_out new one able get high level
[ner:number] hand investor [ner:location] someone understand market kind_of like potential problem people could easily buy upgrade portfolio buy some_of asset replacement_cost
even cost go_up will continue go_up developer actually sell asset get_they_money_out maybe slight profit still able acquire property replacement_cost could build exist site
opportunity think really good
next_question [ner:person]_[ner:organization]
sorry keep go kind steal question [ner:number] question [ner:person] happen phase [ner:number] [ner:duration] concession_situation customer stay [ner:percent] rent_increase
maybe speak term history
go uptick turnover short term [ner:location] [ner:date] thing kind go plan
much delay ultimate recovery estimation
well think function economy whether job_growth in-migration stay right
look migration example [ner:number] [ner:number] people move [ner:location] [ner:duration] [ner:date] abroad
find foreign folk much use rent move a_lot_of highrise as_well
continue good news market big [ner:location] [ner:number] unit [ner:number] unit huge amount inventory
really remain see happen
clearly recession happen time [ner:duration] would good recovery [ner:location]
go along get along like [ner:date] probably fine
think psyche merchant_builder [ner:date] investor invest new project definitely change
view hope reasonable hope get_they_capital_out small profit
people approach example buy lease_up
discussion well prepare buy lease-up [ner:date]
idea merchant_builder realistic term pricing might [ner:date] think go good thing sure
okay
[ner:ordinal] question dumb [ner:number] blame tequila
look back [ner:location] [ner:location] success noma_ii look back say gosh wish maybe bit aggressive develop sooner deliver better market
case affect strategy development [ner:location]
supply-driven weight [ner:date] maybe would less inclined add development_project early deliver better market [ner:location] later
think definitely calculus look
question hold land get expensive [ner:set]
think construction_cost go go think might able deliver strong market [ner:date] a_lot_of competition different analysis make
[ner:number] look sure
question ultimately get math work view market obviously
well [ner:location] a_lot_of people pull back competitor glad
next_question [ner:person]_[ner:organization]
will keep short [ner:number]
curious context low levered balance_sheet share trade certainly estimate nav significant extent curious share_repurchase fit corporate finance_matrix point guy
well share_repurchase always forte
multiple cycle purchase share
real issue become issue volatility get kind scale
fundamentally believe think team believe nibble share let say think [ner:organization] make a_lot_of sense
get size sell asset [ner:money] main_street buy stock back discount wall_street
rational trade really good unless go size
challenge [ner:duration] stock volatile
get point think really good value
sudden market drive stock_price buy
[ner:number] kind interesting academic question
make perfect sense
question execute
execute really make difference
next_question [ner:person]_[ner:organization]
share average stabilize yield [ner:number] project either lease-up development [ner:date]
sure
stabilize yield average around [ner:percent]
[ner:date] rent
yes
[ner:person] mention reset underwriting [ner:set] pass
share occupancy new lease renewal_growth_expectation [ner:date] get [ner:percent] midpoint revenue_growth_guidance
go bottom-up reforecast every community
take number
look say progression
give progression new lease renewal already provide [ner:date]
far go_out quarter-by-quarter progression something ever prepare
comfortable go get midpoint guidance same-store
okay
comment delivery slip back half [ner:date] concern track [ner:date] delivery light will back weight
think stuff forecast deliver [ner:date] already mention earlier [ner:person] put pretty good effort around try time account delay project
inventory know [ner:location] good datum construction_completion_standpoint also lease_up
important reason [ner:person] mention earlier important know exactly go_on all_of inventory point need find new home [ner:percent] merchant_builder_product
ultimately prepare position asset long term
track closely
confident number use supply good number
conclude question-and-answer_session
would like turn conference back mr._[ner:person] chairman chief_executive_officer closing_remark
well appreciate time [ner:date] will see upcome [ner:organization]
thanks
take care
conference [ner:date] conclude
thank attend [ner:date] presentation
may [ner:date] disconnect
