CONFERENCE CALL PARTICIPANTS EILEEN DUNN BRUCE NELSON TRANSCRIPT Editor Operator Hello and welcome to the Office Depot mid-quarter update. I would like to introduce Miss Eileen Dunn, Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations, who will make a few opening comments. Miss Dunn, you may begin. EILEEN DUNN Good morning. Welcome to our mid-quarter update for the fourth quarter, 2001. Before Bruce makes his comments, let me remind you that except for historical information, the matters discussed in this taped message are forward-looking within the meanings of the Product Securities Litigation Reform Act. Forward-looking statements including projections and anticipated levels of future performance involve risks and/or uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed herein. These risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time by Office Depot and are filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which include and without limitation our 10 K's and 10-Q's. You are strongly urged to review such files for a more detailed discussion of such risks and uncertainties. Now, let me transfer this call over to Bruce Nelson, Office Depot's CEO. BRUCE NELSON Thanks Eileen. Thanks to everyone who is dialed in to listen to our business outlook for the fourth quarter which ends December 29, 2001. In a brief summary since we reported our third quarter results on October 17th, North America retail sales trends have somewhat improved via [unintelligible] sales particularly to our large contract customers have softened, and international sales and local currencies have held steady. As we previously stated, overall sales trends continue to be negatively impacted by a week domestic economic environment. However I am pleased to say that our 48,000 worldwide employees are continuing to find new ways to drive sales, manage and control costs, and increase shareholder returns. I continue to be encouraged by our consistently improving operating performance across all business segments. I will now make some brief comments about fourth quarter trends in each of our three reported business segments. First North America retail. Comparable retail sales so far in this quarter has slightly improved over third quarter trends, and the forecast we gave when we reported our third quarter results. Comp sales in October were in line with our estimate of high single digit negative growth, but we saw a nominal improvement in our sales trends for most of November. However, sales trends on the Friday, Saturday and Sunday after Thanksgiving were somewhat disappointing and mirrored the trends we have experienced all year. Which is weaker sales trends on weekends compared to sales during the week when most of our core small to medium size business customers shop. We believe this reflects the same weakness in consumer spending that we have seen throughout 2001. Technology and furniture rated categories continue to underperform while our core office supply business remains steady. We now anticipate compareable North America retail sales for the fourth quarter will finish in the negative 6 to 7% comp range. Which would be a modest improvement over the range we gave on our third quarters earnings call last month. On the gross margin side we are projecting gross margin improvement on a year over year basis but below third quarter levels as a result of fourth quarter merchandise mix changes, nd somewhat lower annual volume rebates from suppliers as our overall 2001 sales growth. We continue to keep tight control over expenses while at the same time improving virtually all of our customer service measurements. Turning to business services group. In our contract business, we continue to see sales negatively impacted by the weakening economy and employee layoffs in our large customer segment. In fact, contract sales have shown a further softness from our forecast last month as large businesses, in particular, have accelerated layoffs and are controlling expenses even more aggressively. Our catalog and E-Commerce businesses have been less impacted and continue to show positive growth. As a result, if current trends continue in this segment, we think fourth 2 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

NOVEMBER 28, 2001 / 1:00PM, ODP.OQ - Office Depot Mid-Quarter Business Update quarter compareable sales growth could decline to the mid-single digit negative range for this group. BSG growth margins continue benefit from disciplined contract pricing but will also be negatively impacted by somewhat lower supplier rebates as a result of softer sales performance. We continue to see improvement in productivity and efficiency somewhat offset by a lack of leverage in warehouse and delivery fleet fixed costs. Total BSG operating costs as a percentage of sales are forecasted to be well below last year's level, continuing the improvement we have shown all year. Interestingly, the number of customers orders is rising, total lines are increasing but average ticket is declining. We are growing the number of new customers, increasing our retention of existing customers but they are buying fewer units. We see these as continued signs of a deteriorating and difficult short-term economic environment. On the international front, quarter to date sales and local currencies in our international division have continued to hold steady with strength returning to Germany one of our largest European revenue companies. At this stage in the quarter we still believe sales in U.S. dollars will be in the low double digit range for the fourth quarter. Currency while somewhat neutral in the early part of the quarter has now returned to its negative partern of earlier in the year with the Euro dropping to the mid to high 80s and the British pound hovering around the 140's range which will negatively impact the reported sales in dollars. Our highly profitable international division continues to grow faster than the European economies generally, and remains in full control over selling margins and operating costs. We are on target to begin operations in Switzerland in early 2002 and will soon announce our entry into another new European country later in 2002. International continues to be the highest growth potential of all of our businesses and we intend to continue to invest in this high return on investment segment. To summarize our retail business is showing sequential improvement in comps for the third consecutive quarter, and total company growth margins continue to improve on a year over year basis. Our international business, while still plagued by currency issues remains a constant, steady performer.

Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO Thank you, John. I'm going to just briefly comment on the income statement. And then turn it over to Jim Andrasick to talk about cash flow balance sheet and other related issues. We did expect as we've noted publicly prior to this a poor first quarter at Matson and that's basically what happened. We did perform slightly better than our plan both at Matson and at A&B and Aggregate for the quarter. We are forecasting results to improve for A&B in the next quarter and for the remainder of the year. Let me first talk about Matson and talk about where we're going. First, we had deferred because of difficult economic circumstances in Hawaii, a rate increase that we would normally put into effect earlier in the year. We have announced a rate increase and it was effective April 14th at 2.75 percent. And that should help us as we forward in the year. I would also note second that we have just announced an increase in the fuel surcharge from 3.25 to 4.75 percent. There's a relatively unstable situation I'm sure as you know in the are of oil prices. We averaged $17 per barrel during the first quarter of this year. However, the last stop at the gas pump so to speak was at $26. We don't expect that it's going to stay at that level, but nonetheless there has been a very significant increase in oil prices recently. I would also just note, that on the positive side that volume trends at Matson are up. January and February were both quite weak, but March was better and April is starting our pretty well. In terms of the two components of our freight package, containers are doing pretty well which is most of our business, but the auto business that you will note commented in the report, it was down 23 percent year over year our shipment of autos. And that is still relatively soft. So those are just some top line things that are happening at Matson. I would also just for your information, note that we have implemented a reduction in the vessel serving Hawaii from eight to seven in January. We'll get the full benefit of that in the second quarter. If our cargo volume does return later on in the year, we may go back up to eight vessels, but for the moment we're down to a seven vessel fleet to Hawaii. We're seeing increased productivity at our Sand Island Terminal in Hawaii. I would characterize it as better but not good enough. Still a drag on Matson's performance. There are improvements that are occurring. The efficiencies are getting better, but we still have a way to go there. And that's going to be another area where we should expect to see improvement in both our efficiencies and our cost structure as the year goes along. Other than that, I would just finally note for Matson that we also expect to see gains at our affiliate for the rest of the year which should help our income. Just to summarize, we did have a very touch fourth quarter, a difficult first quarter. We expect that there will be some substantial improvement in the second quarter and beyond at Matson. And we're certainly working very hard to make that happen. In the real estate business basically everything is at or above our plans for 2002. I can say that just for prospective purposes that we've had 10 years of never having missed a plan in real estate. So I think that business is going to do pretty much what we think it's going to do for the year. In the leasing area, commercial properties, there's been some softness in occupancy, but again we've anticipated that. We expect that as the year goes along we'll probably see some pick ups there. We had a very good property sales quarter compared to a great sales quarter that we had last year, but it will still very good. We sold and industrial property portfolio in Dallas and a number of small Hawaii properties in the quarter. 3 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

APRIL 18, 2002 / 7:00PM, - Q1 2002 Alexander&Baldwin Earnings Conference Call The only area where there's a little bit of weakness is in some of the resort development activities that we have in Hawaii. If you've go a resort project and it's basically in a launch or a sale at least up phase things are slow, but that represents a small component of our capital in the neighborhood of about, 6, 7 percent of the total capital that's in the business. So it's a relatively small exposure but there are some short term reductions in meeting some of our objectives there but it's certainly containable. In the food products area the investment there is principally our sugar plantation on Maui. We have a residual, small interest now of about $12 million or so in C&H sugar refinery in California, but it's mostly the agricultural business on Maui in sugar. Sugar prices have dropped recently. However, we've priced forward about 14 percent of our crops so far at pretty good prices. We'll see what happens to the rest of the group as the year goes on. We think that prices will probably firm. But we're also no in the business of projecting commodity prices all that well either. I would say on a positive note, that the farming bill which is sort of the structure under which our sugar business operates, the expectation is quite positive. And high that there will be a renewal of farm legislation which will provide stability and probably a little bit of an improved pricing environment for sugar over a number of years in the future. It's still caught up in Congress right now, but that will probably be passed some time in the next few months. In terms of the company's development and acquisition activity. We continue to work on several large projects and activities. We are getting close to a decision on what would be the purchase of two vessels that are being constructed for our container operations to Hawaii. We're not quite there yet but we're relatively close to a decision on that. This would be in excess as we've noted before of $100 million per vessel but not too much in excess of $100 million per vessel if we were to make that decision. We are also expecting to complete, and when we do, announce a longer term real estate development venture with a partner in Hawaii. On the acquisition front, it's been publicly reported in Hawaii that Victoria Ward has reached an agreement to sell. We were apart of the process. We were not ultimately the party that they decided to go forward with. And partly, I guess that was because the price go to a point where we were not comfortable that it was a good investment for Alexander & Baldwin. There's a tendency to sometimes chase things beyond a point where it makes good economic sense, so we pushed away from the table at a point in the process. And it appears the General Growth will be owner of the Victoria Ward portfolio in Honolulu. We are also involved in some other acquisition activity which we're not able to really comment on at this time, but we're quite active in looking for value driven investments for the company. So with that, I would just make two final points. One, we've had a - there's an accounting change that has occurred which has not changed in any material way the results of the company, but it has changed in some respects how we report these results in real estate and Jim Andrasick will talk about that in a moment. I would also note that John Kelley is going to talk about the economy of Hawaii. And it certainly looks like the projections are getting much, much better. In fact, the gross product for the states there's been quite an optimistic upward adjustment to what the economic circumstances are for Hawaii for the remainder of the year. And John will comment on that. So with that, I'll turn it over to you Jim. Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - Senior Vice Presidnt, CFO Thank you very much, Allen. First, if I can just turn to the P&L on page five and comment on a couple of items. The treasury environment, of course is very favorable. If I could just point out on the interest expense line we are down 2.8 million in expenses, which is about 50 percent from the prior year's quarter. And we've had a following wind on this on rates as everyone is aware all year long. 4 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

APRIL 18, 2002 / 7:00PM, - Q1 2002 Alexander&Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Our average rate for the first quarter of 2002 is 4.2 percent. That's on all borrowings, fixed in floating, compared to a prior year's quarter of 6.6 percent. And about half of this is a result of the reduction in expense was lower volumes, $85 million in lower average balances and about half was due to rate. So good performance there. On the corporate expense line we're down 800,000. We had a non reoccurrence this year of the charitable contribution of stock in 2001, as well as about 300,000 in absolute reductions in G&A which the result of various management initiatives to control cost. Let me add, the income tax line, and I know many of you haven't probably taken the effect rate or computed that, but you will know that last year's first quarter we used an effective rate of 35.5 percent. This year, it's up to 38 percent. That's a pretty large increase, so I thought I would comment on that. Part of it is the result of not taking some large charitable deductions for low basis stock that was contributed last year. Part of it is a dividend received deduction that we got on investments last year which will not - since we have sold those investments, that will not reoccur. And also we had a roll off of various low income housing and tax credits late in 2001, which will not reoccur in 2002. At least we're not projecting that they will. I need to comment as Alan said on discontinued operations because for presentation purposes we have broken out properties and agriculture separately. And as our press release stated, the new standard of accounting for disposal of long lived assets now treats the sale of certain income producing assets, even individual building as discontinued operations if their earnings and cash flows are separately identifiable and they're material to results. I think, as everyone recognizes, the standards of materiality have gone down considerably, both in the SEC's eyes and public accounting eyes. We had two sales in the first quarter that qualified under these rules and that contributed 4.3 million which was treated on an after tax basis. And we've attempted to continue to give you information in the revenue and operating profit lines which shows comparable year performance and treated these discontinued operations as a deduct from both revenue and operating profit. But this will have an effect on our property sales activities going forward. In that we will have to declare in advance properties that maybe put up for sale and have buyers identified. The other thing I would point out is that in this first quarter's activity, the proceeds from those land sales sold about 30 million. You can see that as the deduction from revenues. And all of those monies were held in escrow pending reinvestment in qualified 10-31 replacement properties which has been A&B's long standing practice. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flows, really there were only three events that explain most of the account changes in the first quarter beyond the normal ebb and flow of seasonal working capital changes. The first was a payment of $38 million tax bill, U.S. federal tax bill which - in the first quarter which was the result of our bank stock sale late last year. This reduced current liabilities and of course impacted operating cash flow. Another event was the sale by Matson of two vessels to a minority affiliate. These ships had been under charger to that affiliate with an option to buy. That option was exercised. And at year end 2001 those vessels had been held in current assets for disposition. The cash proceeds of about 16 million from that sale were contributed to the capital construction fund which closed that account balance . And finally the third event, as I previously noted is property sales. That reduced the property net account by about $25 million. And the cash proceeds were placed in escrow for reinvestment which is carried in other assets that in term explains the $30 million increase in that account. Overall results was a net requirement to borrow about 44 million against that revolving credit facilities and which is shown in the increase in debt, and also as a source of funds and cash flow. 5 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

APRIL 18, 2002 / 7:00PM, - Q1 2002 Alexander&Baldwin Earnings Conference Call I would just comment on two other areas. Capital expenditures as shown in the cash flow were down considerable year-over-year. We spent 8.2 million in the first quarter. And most of the decline was at Matson where we have either - we have deferred equipment purchases and throttled back consistent with our earnings performance. The second point would be on, which we discussed at our last call, is on pension credits and debits. In prior years, the company has reported income from it's over funding in effect of it's pension obligation. That over funding continues - continues through the first quarter. However, it's not at the same level as previous years. And that in tern results in a lower level of pension credits year over year. So last year we picked up about six to seven million in favorable income pre tax. This year, we're projecting about break even to one million. So those credits which are none cash impact on earnings will decline. I would just make a final comment if I may on transparency. A&D has no special purpose entities. The full extent of our guarantees and other commitments is disclosed in our annual reported and in the 10-k on page 24 just as a reference. But let me just quickly restate what our position is. We do have letters of credit out standing and performance bonds. At year end 2001, those totaled about 26 million, that's been reduced to 22 million as a result of the release of various performance bonds against real estate projects. And we do guarantee the debt of two affiliate companies in the aggregate 46.5 million at year end 2001. That is unchanged at quarter end. So we finally report the company continues to be in excellent financial health. And with that, I will turn it to John Kelley. John Kelley - Alexander & Baldwin - Vice President of Investor Relations Thanks, Jim. In the all important psychologically as well as from a solid economic point of view visitor industry trends continue to improve. I think many of you have read some articles in the eastern press noting that mainland visitors are back nearly to normal, that is pre 9-11 levels. But visitors from Japan or other from other international areas continue to lag. In the January and February numbers which came out since our last call, the total number of arrivals were down 16.5 percent in January and about 9 percent in February. The March numbers aren't out yet. And if you split those in January, people on domestic sights were down 8.4 percent, and in February they are two-tenths of 1 percent. So a good trend there. International arrivals were down 28.8 percent in January. And now they've improved the decline of 24.7 percent by February. In the visitor days that is the more relevant economic measure that dwells high in the economic contribution, in January visitor days were down about 13 percent and that had come up to a decline of just 5 percent in February. If you look at the most recent period in the seven days ending the ninth of April, which is the most recent domestic data available, domestic rivals were at 91 percent of prior comparable period levels. And looking just at Japan in the seven days ending the 10th of April, Japanese travelers were at 82 percent of their prior year level and that's down from a 95 percent level they'd reached earlier in the month. So the domestic travelers continue to show strength. Japan continues to lag, but the improvement is gratifying. In terms of Hawaii's own economic measures, some of the leading indicators and other things we've talked about are still not reflecting all of the improvements. There's a lot of noise in the data. But if you look at some of the physical factors that drive demand and provide visitors, airline seats are probably one of the most noteworthy. And the employee visitor and convention bureau reported the other day that there are about 400, 000 new seats have been announced in calendar year '02. And that's in addition to about almost 190,000 seats that have been restored since suspensions following 9-11. And particularly - in particular Hawaiian airlines announced direct service to Ontario, California and Sacramento, and in October they'll be starting direct service to Phoenix. So some of the air carriers here are reaching out to mainland destinations. In addition, the more traditional carriers like united, just announced two weekly Denver to Honolulu non stops. And in June they're going to add two - a second domestic flight from San Francisco direct to Konan, the big island, with a 757. 6 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

APRIL 18, 2002 / 7:00PM, - Q1 2002 Alexander&Baldwin Earnings Conference Call In addition to American airlines in mid June it's going to add daily service, a second daily flight from Los Angeles direct to the island of Kauai. So I think what's happening is that the demands, especially from the mainland is being read loud and clear in the airline industry and they're responding. On the economic front, unemployment levels in Hawaii are improving slightly. February's most recent data available it's 4.7 percent unemployment rate. That was a slight improvement from 4.8 in January and five in December. Hawaii continues to look better on that measure than the U.S. February for the U.S. of course was 6.1 percent. I think if you step back from the numbers, let me read you a short overview from a set of economists at the university of Hawaii. I think this more or less says it all. And these guys are as an unbiased as you can get from the academic point of view. Headline is brief recession likely over. And they go on to say "outside of tourism, the state has weathered the current slow down fairly well. Job losses have been significant but the labor markets appears to have turned the corner. Hawaii will likely experience only a mild and short lived recession in real personal income with year over year growth resuming in the second quarter of '02. Economic recovery will strengthen as the year proceeds." And they go on in the article to say there are really only two significant risk factors, one is uncertainty over the state of economics affairs in Japan. And the second of course is the unrest in the Middle East, which could trip a lot of things going the other direction. And when you take these things together, the present forecast for visitor arrivals by the state agency responsible projections is for an improvement of 3.5 percent in 2002. And that follows the decline of 9 percent in 2001. On the personal income front, the state's projecting about a 1.3 percent real increase in personal income in '02. And that's an improvement over their prior figures. And in their real gross state product projection there, now as Allen stated 1.7 percent for '02. And then 2 percent and around 2 percent thereafter in '03. And that contrasts with about 1.4 percent projected for the actuals in 2001. So I think we're looking at relatively modest economic growth, but you've got to take into account that we've got one weak quarter in '02. So those numbers actually reflected fairly rapid and reasonably strong turnaround. I think the fact is from an operating leverage point of view that's exactly the kind of environment we can flourish in. So with that, I'd like to step back from our monologue if you will and open it to questions-and-answers. So operator if you would explain the ground rules for using the phones for Q&A. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Operator Certainly, sir. Thank you very much, Mr. Kelley. For those of you who have a question that was one-four on your touch-tone phone at this time. Now, please keep in mind, that if you're using a speakerphone, you must pick up your handset to press one-four to register in our question-and-answer line up. Once again, for those of you who have questions, please press one four on your touch-tone phone now. Thank you very much, sir. And it looks like our first question is going to come from a Mr. Craig Seroise (ph) . Please proceed, sir. Craig Seroise Good morning, to you guys. I've all ready had a long day, but good morning out there. One thing I'd like, if you can, qualify - quantify the 15 million drop in the operating income at Matson. Can you separate out what was ship operations? And what might have been due to the Sand Island pick up I guess it was? 7 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

APRIL 18, 2002 / 7:00PM, - Q1 2002 Alexander&Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO Yeah, I - this is Allen, I can give you some general direction - really all that specific, Craig (ph) . It's a good question. The terms of the variance for the quarter, market factors represented about $5 million of the variance strictly the market. That would be Hawaii and the Guam market. In very general terms there was about a $3 million reduction because of a share change versus the competition. And part of that had to do with the fact that our service levels are low. So it wasn't just a matter of pricing. It was just that because of some of the problems that we had we've lost some business here from what had been a historically share that the Matson had had. So that's about another three million. We've got about 2.5 million of inefficiencies at Sand Island. We have about $1 million of unusual bad debt, almost all of which is due to Kmart. We have about a $1 million, Jim mentioned the pension credit issues, about $1 million of the pension credit change year-over-year. About $600,000 reduction in our affiliate performance, which brings you up to about $13 million of the variances. You've got a couple of million dollars which is everything else. Inflationary increase is offset by improvements because we have fewer vessels and other benefits that have been achieved. Craig Seroise Thanks. That's good detail. That's more than I expected without your Matson guys there. Now ... Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO I don't know if that's a compliment or not. Craig Seroise It's a compliment. The Sand Island, what's needed there to improve the efficiency? It this is volume cargo thing or have other things been identified? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO It's really not volume driven. It's just after decades of using one approach is how the terminal has operated. They mad a conversion about two-thirds of the way last year. It turned out that it's been not only from a technical standpoint but management and labor standpoint much, much more significant transition than the company had originally anticipated. So the shake down period here is taking a while. We're seeing improvement, for example we had in the first quarter, just one of the ratios, and I mean it's not really very god right now. The first quarter we were getting off of our cranes about 17.2 moves an hour. We expected that we wanted to be getting about 21, that was our objective. But by the end of the quarter, we were operating at slightly above 18. So there was a trend upward, but as I in general terms indicated at the beginning, while we're seeing progress, we're still not hitting the objective that had been established. And it's not one or two things. It's a list of like 20 or 30 different issues that deal with different practices and how the shifts are unloaded and then reloaded when they leave. But we're making progress. It's the biggest change that this part of the company has had in decades. It also involved things like global positioning systems and things that just don't necessarily come all that easy to an operating business. So it's an absolutely, revolutionary change that we probably, certainly did underestimate the challenges of just launching as well as we wanted to. 8 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

APRIL 18, 2002 / 7:00PM, - Q1 2002 Alexander&Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Craig Seroise Thanks. Now you mentioned the bad debt due to Kmart. Did they - on the property side, did they lease any properties from you? I know Wal-Mart has a Hawaii property. Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO Yeah. The answer to that is that we sold approximately two years ago a Kmart property that we had owned. So on the leasing side, there is no exposure. On the operating side, we actually did pretty well relative to the size of business we have with Kmart in terms of our recovery of the receivables. It's just that we weren't able to recover all. Craig Seroise OK. And just the capital - the cap ex budget for this year. If you buy those ships that you were - referred to, would that be this year or would that be going into more next year? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO You can assume that there will be modest at best and perhaps zero but very, very little capital impact in the year 2002 from any vessel construction activity. Craig Seroise OK. Then what's the plan for '01 without that possibility? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO The plan for '01? Or the plan for '02? Craig Seroise I mean '02, excuse me. Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO Yeah. We have a plan that has about $120 million of capital spending in it. Craig Seroise OK. Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO That involves a massive and a fairly low level of 25 to $30 million. We got our real estate business in at about $80 million and our agribusiness in at about $10 million. Now of the $80 million we have in the real estate business, you can assume that about half of that or maybe even a little big 9 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

APRIL 18, 2002 / 7:00PM, - Q1 2002 Alexander&Baldwin Earnings Conference Call more is what we would call growth acquisition activity. So it's not replacement or project spending it's acquisition activity that we put in our budget for the year. Craig Seroise OK. That were - that would seem to indicate to me that there's going to be a lot more spending in the - as the year progresses than there was in the first quarter which was pretty low, but that's OK. Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO That's correct. Craig Seroise Yeah. And then for Jim, is that 38 percent tax rate good for the year? Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - Senior Vice Presidnt, CFO That is our latest projection based on everything we know about full year estimates, yes. Craig Seroise OK. One final one I have for you if it could. Let's see if I - I'm not an accountant I don't know if I understand this new rules here. Does this mean that every time there's a real estate sale that you might have to report discontinued operations for the quarter? This could get messy if that's the case. Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - Senior Vice Presidnt, CFO Well the technical answer is yet if it's material. And if, as we do with just about all of our income properties, we track them from revenues and cost standpoints separately. So yes, this is a very messy rule for a company like Alexander & Baldwin. Craig Seroise Right. Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - Senior Vice Presidnt, CFO I know the REITs are struggling with it too. And we're all going to be very interested and see how, you know, various companies interpret this who are in the real estate business. Craig Seroise OK. Me too. OK. Thanks a lot. 10 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

APRIL 18, 2002 / 7:00PM, - Q1 2002 Alexander&Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO I would just make one comment on that. Jim mentioned it earlier on, but the strange aspect of this is that we will sell a property for example for $25 million. We will then put the proceeds from that which we have done historically consistently into escrow, we will exchange it on a tax deferred basis into another property. So we consider the sale as a continued operation. But from a practical standpoint, we've had a history of reinvesting into other properties the proceeds from our sales. Craig Seroise Right. That hasn't... Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO So it's a very difficult accounting rule for us. Craig Seroise Yes, well that hasn't changed. My difficulty is trying to explain that to maybe some investors that don't understand but that's my problem. OK. So thanks a lot. Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - Senior Vice Presidnt, CFO It has the practical effect of making total operating profit far less meaningful than it used to be. Craig Seroise Yeah. Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - Senior Vice Presidnt, CFO But we have made an effort to provide you the information in a way that you can see it on the old basis and also see the adjustments. Craig Seroise Right. Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - Senior Vice Presidnt, CFO And as long as we're able to we'll continue to do that. Craig Seroise OK. Thank you very much and have a good day. 11 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

APRIL 18, 2002 / 7:00PM, - Q1 2002 Alexander&Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - Senior Vice Presidnt, CFO Thanks, Craig (ph) . Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO Thanks, Craig (ph) . Operator And our next question comes from Mr. Keith Hanson (ph) Please proceed, sir. Keith Hanson Aloha from Sunny, Columbus. Thank you for the additional disclosure. Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO That is Ohio. Keith Hanson It is Ohio, that's right. It's supposed to cool off by the weekend but I guess we're enjoying it this week. The question I had was is there going to be any impact on Matson from a potential work disruption in the west coast? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO Yeah, that's a good question, a very good question. I can give you the stock response we don't know and we hope not. From a practical standpoint, this is the every three year reopening of the contract with the IOWU first on the west coast and then in Hawaii. The big issue this year is the use of technology on the - at the terminals. And I don't think anyone really knows how difficult an issue that is going to be between the union and the various management organizations that are involved on the other side. We hope that there won't be any disruptions. Normally, what happens is that instead of a strike there have been some slow downs in the past. And those are difficult to deal with as well. So, you know, it's really hard to say what's going to happen. The hope is that everything will be settled in a reasonable manner as the contract expires at the end of June. Keith Hanson OK. Thank you. Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - Senior Vice Presidnt, CFO We do bargain as an industry, Keith. So it's the whole coast at once, one employer group, one labor group. 12 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from Mr. Tom Spiro (ph) . Please proceed sir. Tom Spiro - Spiro Capital Tom Spiro (ph) , Spiro Capital (ph) , hello? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO Hi, Tom (ph) . Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - Senior Vice Presidnt, CFO Hi, Tom (ph) . Tom Spiro - Spiro Capital Hello. Could you update us please on the potential entrant of one or more new competitors into the Matson line of business, yes, Pasha (ph) and the second potential competitor? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO Yeah, there's really - we didn't say anything about this. We've talked about this during the last two or three calls. And you're probably wondering why we haven't mentioned it in this call and that's basically because there is absolutely no new information. The ship that was partially - it was under construction partially built. It was involved in a bankruptcy action, a ship yard. And it's sitting at the same state of completion that it was about nine months ago. So we don't know whether that ship will ever be completed. There's speculation that it won't but we can't say. So that's where things are with Pasha which was the entrant into the Hawaii service that was most imminent. There's been an announcement made by a group, it calls itself Santa Maria. And we haven't heard anything about them in quite a while. So they had planned to secure financing relative to coming into the Hawaii market. The - what's happened with this Pasha vessel and also the fact that there's something called American classic crews which had $300 million plus of government loans that's going upside down on a cruise line that serves Hawaii. It might make it a little bit more difficult from a political standpoint for these things to be financed but we really don't know. So at this point, the reason it wasn't brought up today is that there's absolutely no information that would make for any changes. Tom Spiro - Spiro Capital Thanks a lot. 13 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

APRIL 18, 2002 / 7:00PM, - Q1 2002 Alexander&Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO You're welcome, Tom (ph) . Operator And once again, for those of you who have a question, that was one four on your touch-tone phone. Thank you. And our next question comes from Mr. Paul Patrick (ph) , please proceed sir. Paul Patrick Hi, good morning. Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO Hi, Paul (ph) . Paul Patrick A question on Matson, you talked about service difficulties and it sounds like it might be something separate from Sand Island. Is that the case? And can you talk about why it's going on? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO No, it's mostly Sand Island. I mean they're all - these are service disruptions. The service disruptions increase in the winter, but that's sort of you sail the same seas that everyone does. So your ship arrival on time percentage has a tendency to go down during the winter season, but that goes down for everybody. The principal problem is the Sand Island problem. Paul Patrick OK. And you also talked about pricing pressure from I guess it's the CSX is that - is there anything new? Is there any reason behind that? I know that they heard that they are getting - are looking to be sold. I don't know if that would have anything to do with it? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO Yeah, I didn't say anything about pricing pressure from CSX. Paul Patrick You said pricing pressure as a cause of the decline in the business at Matson. 14 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

APRIL 18, 2002 / 7:00PM, - Q1 2002 Alexander&Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO No, I really didn't. Paul Patrick Oh, you didn't? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO If I did I apologize for saying that. You know, in this business it's just about like every other semi commodity business, you've got a lot of punching and pulling going on an a day to day basis. They - CSX is pretty competitive now on pricing but that is not a principal factor for what is - what's happened on the performance side. Paul Patrick OK. Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - Senior Vice Presidnt, CFO And both carriers have made general REIT decisions recently. And both carriers have in their own ways redefined their bunker surcharges. So I think we're - that's really not a practical problem. Paul Patrick Great. And then one question on the property leasing, the margins were down considerably year-over-year is there any explanation behind that? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO Yeah, the margins are down a little bit. It's a little bit occupancy and we - it's a bit of a few one timers. Our plans for the year show that, you know, that we're going to be OK for the full year. That we're going to have a pretty good performance. We had about a 6 percent blip year-over-year decline in the first quarter. But there's really nothing that's all that remarkable or unusual happening in our portfolio. We're very diversified. But we're diversified on the mainland which - west coast, which has had it's own, you know, set of economic challenges until recently and then in Hawaii. So we're showing weaknesses in the portfolio but it's not that significant. And we're not - we're just not that concerned about. Paul Patrick Great. Thank you. Operator Once again, for those of you who have a question that was one four. 15 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

APRIL 25, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q3 2002 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call Operating income for the quarter was compared to operating and income of $2.4 million for the third quarter of last year, and a $1.8 million operating loss in the second quarter of fiscal 2002, excluding the results of Fithem (ph) and Ametron, which enter acquired effective October 1st, and October 30th versus 2001 respectively, and would have had sales of $17.3 million and an operating income of $1.8 million dollars, down 21 percent and 25 percent respectively from the third quarter last year, and up 16 percent, and 103 percent sequentially from the second quarter of fiscal 2002. Net income from the third quarter was $945,000, or four cents per diluted share, compared to $2.2 million or 12 cents per diluted share in the third quarter of last year, and a loss of two cents per diluted share for the second quarter of 2002. Prior to the extraordinary gain, the improvement in profitability over the second quarter was a result of increased ad sales and improved efficiency at a Syracuse operations. Manufacturing yields, and operating performance of during the third quarter were also better than anticipated. The growth in the third quarter, over the second quarter, was driven by group. Wireless group would acquire over $13.4 million, up 26 percent sequentially from the second quarter. Eliminating the impact of the acquisitions of Fithen (ph) and Ametron, Wireless Group net sales increased 30 percent sequentially from the second quarter. The growth of Wireless Group net sales was the result of increased marketing share of component products in several of our leading manufacturers. And resumption of demand for our Adrena-line (ph) for three G amplifier application. Wireless Group customer concentration for the quarter as a percent of Wireless Group net sales was at 18 percent, Ericsson at 17 percent, Lucent at 10 percent, and Motorola at 90 percent. We continue to impressively invest in new product development for wireless infrastructure, and wireless applications. New products last quarter have been well received in the market, and more than a dozen new ones have already been achieved. Sample requests for new design applications continue to be very robust. For the space and defense group, net sales for the third quarter were $6.5 million, up 14 percent from net sales of $5.6 million for the third quarter of last year. for the quarter with $5.9 million, driven by follow-on orders from jamming sub-systems and initial funding for Antennae Distribution Networks for a ground based radio program. March 31, 2002, was approximately $35.1 million. Third quarter made some substantial progress in establishing a presence in China to better serve the Asian market. We now have a facility in China, and the associated licensing to support our product's sales, design, manufacturing and distribution. We have also hired the management, sales and engineering team to support this effort. We anticipate initiating production at our China facility during the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Joe Porcello will now review the financial highlights. Joe Porcello - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - Vice President of Finance Good afternoon. The financial highlights of the third quarter income statement, the 50,000 through our column. The gross profit margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2002 was 32.1 percent. This is a 6.2 percent point increase from gross margin of 25.09 percent in the second quarter of this 2002, and a three point two percentage point decrease from the gross margins of 35.3 percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2001. The improvement of gross margins from the second to the third quarter of fiscal 2002 came from the overall increase in sales volume and from crafts and performance at 5M, whose manufacturing facility is now fully operational from the July fire. Including the private and the current acquisitions, growth margins were 39.2 percent for the third quarter of 2002 compared to margins of 36.2 percent of the second quarter and margins of 35.3 percent in the third quarter of last year. 3 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

APRIL 25, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q3 2002 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call Investment in research and development presented net sales with nine percent in the third quarter of 2002 compared to an ongoing three percent revenue in the second quarter of 2002 and 5.5 percent in the third quarter of the last year. Research and development expenditures have risen significantly due to an emphasis by the company on developing new standard products for the wireless infrastructure and local area network applications over the last nine months. This effort has culminated in a number of new purpose station product introductions over the last few months. We assume the same R&D spending will continue with higher rating over the next few quarters as we continue our new product development. Each comes from operations with 2.8 percent of revenue in the third quarter compared to a negative 10.3 percent of revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2002, and 11 percent of the revenue in the third quarter of 2001. Operating margins improved over the second quarter of fiscal 2002 just before providing the new sales level ended in the result of operating performance to . We currently do not expect missing an improvement in our operating income over third quarter 2002 while have volume and it will continue to increase in normal development level . Income before taxes was 6.4 percent for the current third quarter. This compares to a loss before the tax an extraordinary item will negative four point eight percent of revenue in the second quarter of 2002, and it comes before taxes of 19.3 percent of revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2001. Improvements from the loss in the second quarter was attributable to operating losses by the two point four million in quarter two for a loss of one point, operating loss of $1.1 million in quoted . Well, as the overall for the quarter with approximately 21 percent compared to 34.3 percent in the third quarter of 2001. The third, the current tax rate has declined as tax exempt income has grown as a percent of total income and due to the tax benefit resulting from the proposed buyer and . In connection with purchase by them in October 2001, we recorded a two point four million dollar extraordinary gain in the second quarter. Directed by the negative goodwill resulting from the transaction, during the third quarter, five of them had loss equal to tax benefits with approximately $1 million compared to a loss equal tax benefit of two point four million for the second quarter. The smaller loss defined them in the quarter three compared to quarter two was the result of the resumption in both out sourcing and clean up costs related to the fire and in the movement in manufacturing news. That income as a percent of revenue was five percent in the third quarter compared to 12.7 percent for the third quarter of 2001 and 17.7 percent for the second quarter of fiscal 2002, which concluded with the extraordinary gain amounting to 19.8 percent of revenue. On a per share basis, there wasn't a very (ph) per share for the third quarter of 2002 exploit them. This is compared to 12 times the diluted share in the third quarter of the previous year and 13 cents including the extraordinary gain of 15 cents per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2002. The balance sheet highlights include tag cash and quick work for investments for approximately $125 million in modern 2002, down $3.6 million from June 2001, namely to the all $12 million of the tab being used purchased by them and first half of fiscal 2002. We have continued to enjoy a positive cash flow of proper rations in the first nine months of net income.

Inventories March 31st, 2002, were 20 million compared to 18.6 million in the June 30th, 2001. The inventory increase was due to the addition of 5M into Ametron who had approximately two million dollars in inventory in March 31st, 2002. Inventory levels without the acquisition declined approximately three percent during the first nine months. Capital equipment, employees and services in the first nine months of fiscal 2002 amounted to approximately seven million dollars, up to five million dollars represents new equipment purchased by between October and March 2002 in replace of the that were destroyed in the July fire. Remaining additions were mainly production facility, automated production equipment for our power on Long Island and new and multi-layer manufacturing equipment at in Massachusetts. Accounts payable is March 31, 2002 to 5.1 million dollars. Up 2.8 million from June 30, 2001. The acquisition of side ends and Ametron amounted in $1.4 million March 31st. And a remaining $700,000 rise resulted from the current . Lawrence Sala - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - President and CEO Thanks Joe. At the previous quarters visibility from our given a current level of market visibility through projecting net sales to the inner range of $19 million to $21 million dollars and diluted earnings per share can be in the range of three to five cents for the fourth quarter. We're now taking questions. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Operator Thank you, sir. The question and answer session will be conducted electronically. If you would like to ask a question please press the star key followed by the digit one on your touch-tone telephone. We will in the order you signal us and questions as time permits. Again please press star one if you would like to ask a question. And we'll hear first from Mark Mischeka (ph) , Bank of America Securities. Mark Mischeka - Bank of America Securities Hi, yes. Larry good day, good quarter. The question was, is that really just stepped out. I haven't seen them on them on your customer lists in awhile 17 percent. This is all . Can you describe a little bit about what that is and I think pretty significant to the quarter though. Lawrence Sala - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - President and CEO Yeah, they went and tumbled for us in dollar sales as well for the quarter over our previous business levels with them. Mark (ph) , we had announced last quarter that we had gained market share in our businesses in this years volume purchase agreement negotiations back in December. So we had announced that and that's played out for us and we're seeing that. are falling off into heavy at higher rates than we were in previous quarters. 5 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

APRIL 25, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q3 2002 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call And we also saw this pick up of with them. It was business we probably haven't seen demand for in more than a year and it came back fairly robustly this quarter. So both those factors much larger customer purpose for it than they've been for the last year or so. Mark Mischeka - Bank of America Securities I understand. And then on your visibility you're saying it's, you know, it's still kind of limited them (ph) . Remember last quarter you said that it really increased from a couple weeks to maybe six weeks or so. Are you seeing the change? Are you still up at the six to eight weeks now or has it ticked down. Where are you at with the visibility going into June here? Lawrence Sala - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - President and CEO We can still see the people ordering out in time but it's the ordering that's still sporadic. The demand is not, you know, that's sequentially increasing every month. We go back, you know, we saw strong December, strong January, got a little linger in February and it kind of leveled out there in March, and April so far has been I'd say on the mediocre side. More consistent with February and March than it was with the strife we saw in December and January. So definitely still think people ordering out in time, making , you know, up relative to what we saw in October, November. But not consistently sequential . Mark Mischeka - Bank of America Securities Got you. And then one last question is, I know you didn't give guidance at court here but are you getting any kind of indications for the second half of the year? Are you expecting normal seasonality, seasonal spending patterns from the carriers, or is it too early to say? Lawrence Sala - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - President and CEO It's probably too early to say, Mark (ph) . I think the only guidance we can give you now is that anything out in time is relatively consistent with rates of use and order patterns. It's not dramatically up and it's not dramatically down. So , you know, when we were looking in negotiating and discussing with people back in December they saw appreciable pick up in the second half of the year. I think we found the first half to be stronger than our expectations in the second half to be a little lighter than their expectations. So we're seeing things be pretty consistent out in time with what people are consuming right now. Mark Mischeka - Bank of America Securities Got you. OK. Thanks, Joe and Larry. Lawrence Sala - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - President and CEO Sure. 6 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

APRIL 25, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q3 2002 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call Operator Our next question comes from Rich Alera (ph) of Edenman (ph) . Rich Alera - Edenman Thank you, nice job on the quarter, Larry, and obviously a tough environment here. In terms of the sequential this quarter it seems like you saw a fairly small pick up in the combined contribution from 5M to Ametron and I thought we'd hope in the June quarter, possibly both of them could kick in more significantly. Do you still expect this? And if so is the sort of sequentially guidance really, 'cause we're expecting maybe other parts of the wireless business to maybe not pick up as much. Lawrence Sala - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - President and CEO Yeah, that, we fully expect to see some pick up from -- both Ametron and 5M's production rates have consistently come up in the last, at the end of the last quarter and we expect that to continue. Not an obviously dramatic contribution but certainly a higher contribution than it's been. And we're just being cautious in this potentially small for what we've seen over the last couple of months. So, you know, obviously we'll need some contribution. We're at the high end of our range. We're expecting to see some sequential growth but if things back off as they've been during the summer, we just aren't seeing out that far yet. Rich Alera - Edenman Sure. Power Wave is a pretty basic customer. Could you characterize how much of that is unit driven and how much of that is new content driven? I think I understand that you've got some nice content on some of their newer platforms. Lawrence Sala - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - President and CEO Yeah, that quarter I'd say, is still predominantly unit driven. Just pick up and demand, you know, working off of inventory and using, you know, higher rates of compliment usage. This month we're starting to see more higher dollar product use more consistently from them. So I think a higher dollar content will show more this quarter than it did last. The Power Wave, you know, historically has been a larger customer of ours and they've been or so, you know, 12 to 15 percent more for quite awhile. Rich Alera - Edenman On the Ericsson business, and I know this is a tough one but do you have any feel, they obviously had a spurt in the beginning of last year where they ordered a bunch of three G adrenaline and that kind of went away for several quarters and it sounds like you've had another spurt here. Any feel for if it's going in inventory or if are being shipped out into the field? 7 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

APRIL 25, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q3 2002 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call Lawrence Sala - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - President and CEO No, we can never see that for absolute certain. All we can say is that the demand for goes out a long, long time. There's no, no appreciable holds, no demand right now that we've seen. pretty consistent week to week and month to month for more than a year. And they manufacture at multiple facilities now around the world. So all that we can see, the demand should sustain itself but we don't know where the equipment's going. We don't know if it's going out the door or not. We don't get that kind of visibility. Rich Alera - Edenman But right now their forecasts have been pretty inconsistent looking out. Lawrence Sala - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - President and CEO Yeah. Rich Alera - Edenman You mentioned the land products in your comments. Can you give us some more on kind of what you're doing in that area and when we might see some revenue impact on that? Lawrence Sala - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - President and CEO which we introduced last quarter as part of the multiple product introduction that we had. What we're starting to introduce and past more and more miniaturized products from what we've sold. So they're, you know, our traditional we're one dollar, one dollar and 50 cent ASPs sold into relatively high power applications. Some of these newer products are a quarter of the size or an eighth of the size of those high power products. And we're looking at ASP's of 50 cents down to maybe even 20 to 25 cents over the next couple of quarters. For products going into, you know, 2.4 gigahertz (ph) and five gigahertz (ph) wireless networking application. So that's near at the targeting and, and some of our product development and focus is miniaturizing some for the zinger types of products that we've been susceptible with and high power applications and targeting more feed and networking applications going forward. So we're pretty optimistic about our ability to begin miniaturization. but we're still looking at a quarter or two before we'll be introducing a product publicly with those implications. Rich Alera - Edenman Thank you. Lawrence Sala - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - President and CEO Yep. 8 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

APRIL 25, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q3 2002 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call Operator Our next question comes from Dale Faha (ph) of CIBC World Markets. Dale Faha - CIBC World Markets Afternoon, guys. Joe Porcello - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - Vice President of Finance How are you doing, Dale? Dale Faha - CIBC World Markets Good. A question here on your margins. In your commentary you mentioned that with the 5M and a brother acquisition that you would have had a 39 percent gross margin. Is that correct ? Joe Porcello - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - Vice President of Finance Yeah, that's correct. Dale Faha - CIBC World Markets So when we look into the doom quarter as , can we see that a total gross margin begin to pick up? And then maybe you can give me some idea of what kind of run rate you need at those guys to get us back up to some of your historical corporate gross margins. Joe Porcello - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - Vice President of Finance Well, going forward we're seeing somewhat of a change in the next very large in the third quarter. We don't see the same thing happening in quarter four. We actually see the margins I think will be some here. Dale Faha - CIBC World Markets At what level of revenue at Ametron and 5M do you think you can get their gross margins up to the corporate average, Joe? Joe Porcello - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - Vice President of Finance We need significantly lower coming up from the fire, and the revenues now are probably at a third of what they were at their peak. So we would see a significant increase probably in 5M facility. And probably pretty close to that is the Ametron facilities from the kind of margins we expect to see. Dale Faha - CIBC World Markets Do you have any hope of achieving those kinds of revenues rates during this calendar year? 9 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

APRIL 25, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q3 2002 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call Joe Porcello - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - Vice President of Finance Maybe towards the latter part of the year. It's really too early to tell at this point. Lawrence Sala - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - President and CEO You know just to give you a , in this last quarter revenues were pretty much sequentially flattened by them over the prior quarter. It's just in the prior quarter we were manufacturing an outside facility as well as their own. In this last quarter all of our production was shipped out of our facility. We're expecting an increase in revenue there this quarter from last, you know, off of the base that they had. But there's still a long way from getting back the revenue rate where they were. So we've got a ways to go. Actually next week we have a sales meeting at the 5M facility where we're going to engage our global sales force to start pursuing new business at 5M. And we think we have, you know, many opportunities to gain share. We're selling to the paying customers our to our application as we develop our other products. So it assimilates well into the sales force. But today we've just been getting back up to production with existing customers and the existing business that they had that had been put off after the fires. So we hadn't engaged our sales force yet because, you know, we would not be able to respond to it until the factory was fully running and we're back caught up on our customers . So we're pretty optimistic that sales could grow at 5M fairly rapidly once we engage our sales forces here. So I think by the end of next quarter we'll have a pretty clear picture as to how sales are going well because our sales force will have a couple months of activity in the marketing place to see how we can share. But it's a little early to say that it's the end of the year or it's, you know, a quarter or two quarters, three quarters away yet. But by the time we're in call on this quarter we should be prepared to answer that question more accurately. Dale Faha - CIBC World Markets And tax for next quarter and looking into the next fiscal year? Joe Porcello - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - Vice President of Finance Tax rate for the next portion would be similar to this quarter. we may see a one time come through here or if there's some territorial sales credits. I would say normally to 20 percent. Dale Faha - CIBC World Markets What about next year? 10 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

APRIL 25, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q3 2002 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call Joe Porcello - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - Vice President of Finance Next year's gonna depend on the income level and how the business comes back. If business comes back we'll be expecting up into the low thirties somewhere and the normal rate. Dale Faha - CIBC World Markets And one final question. Could you give me some indication of your core wireless business. What percentage of the business with components and was any of your business higher level assembly or point? Joe Porcello - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - Vice President of Finance Yeah, I mean we're always generating some business and historically it's been about 50/50, Dale (ph) . This past quarter was somewhere between component business and more custom types of products. It's probably more 55 percent components and 45 percent other stuff. And I'd say that mix is probably going to stay in that range. Dale Faha - CIBC World Markets Great. Thank you much. Joe Porcello - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - Vice President of Finance Thank you. Operator Once again, please press star one at this time if you would like to ask a question. We'll move now to Tom Laview (ph) with Robertson Stephens. Tom Laview - Robertson Stevens Thank you, guys. Good quarter there. You talked a little bit about the China announcement and what a little bit more meat on the bone in terms of when you believe production and general business proceeded . Unidentified Sure. We actually initiated that late last calendar year, about the fourth calendar quarter of last year, signed our business license and leased our facility in February, March time frame. And we have actually hired our agent's sale manager, our agent's operations manager and we're relocating from our Syracuse facility over to our China operations. So are hear training now at the Syracuse facility on production activities and sales activities that we'll be initiating over the next couple months. So they should be out of sight within the next couple months. The facility is being outfitted and equipped now. 11 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

APRIL 25, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q3 2002 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call And we're probably looking at something between $250,000 and $500,000 investment to get up and running. Mainly replicating some of the equipment processes we have here at . Nothing too new or too risk (ph) from what we do now. And so they should be on site during the middle of this current quarter to the end of this current quarter. So sometime between late May and June they'll be on site and up and going and we expect to have production initiated some time in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. So before the end of September we'd like to be up and running. we have a couple product lines we'd like to get going with over there. Some new product lines that we'd like to get started with an relocating some product lines and we're seeing some growth. We'd like to address that growth out of that facility because we believe we can be more competitive. Tom Laview - Robertson Stevens One question on the space and defense business. The operating is there. The last couple quarters have been north of 20 percent. Should we assume that that's continuing and working until the end of this year? Unidentified Those margins that are really dependent upon the at the kind of business level we would expect that we could probably maintain time margins, yes. Tom Laview - Robertson Stevens OK. And then by that estimation that would be the wireless business has made a dramatic gain in the operating margin. Could we expect even with sort of flattish revenue growth, getting back to almost a break even in operating margins? Sort of getting back to zero there. Unidentified Yeah. We're really . Yes. Tom Laview - Robertson Stevens OK. And , can you give me the operating income that you stated in the call excluding the Ametron and 5M? Unidentified It's . Tom Laview - Robertson Stevens Well I've got one question here while you're looking for that. With the break out ... 12 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

APRIL 25, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q3 2002 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call Unidentified Operating, I'm sorry, operating income without 5M and Ametron was $1.8 million. Tom Laview - Robertson Stevens In the break period of 2000 two products you obviously spent a lot of time this quarter introducing products. Can you talk a little bit about the vector modulator, the applications there? And then also some application where imbedding active devices. Unidentified Yeah, we've been doing this for quite some time, actually, building products that corporate . This is the first time though in a couple of years that we really aggressively started doing this again in partnership with some . The vector modulator was used at the front end of a power amplifier and actually can do the single manipulation required for linearization. So when somebody instructs it to or amplitude of the signal or improving the amplifier performance . As far as the technology, we can imbed just about any kind of active or passive component into our multi-layer strip line technology. And as I said we promoted it's sole product more than five or six years ago for wireless applications at that point. components. So the technology is not brand new but we're doing a lot of different and new things with it these days. You know, an example is our . Going forward we're looking to do a lot of different things from different types of amplifiers with applications as well as module applications with a technology from both transmit high power applications low power applications. So it's really a platform for us to do many different functions with the modulators. Just the first of those products. Tom Laview - Robertson Stevens OK, that's all. Thank you very much. Unidentified Thanks. Operator from Mark Mischeka (ph) at Bank of America Securities. Mark Mischeka - Bank of America Securities All right. a little housekeeping. Joe, did you have the customer mix for last, I guess not, yeah for last quarter?

Joe Porcello - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - Vice President of Finance Yes I did get and I have the Motorola Power Wave. But we were with Ericsson last quarter. Lawrence Sala - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - President and CEO The quarter before . Mark Mischeka - Bank of America Securities December, yeah. Lawrence Sala - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - President and CEO Yeah. Mark Mischeka - Bank of America Securities OK. Lawrence Sala - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - President and CEO Last quarter Ericsson was about 20 percent of our wireless net sales. Unidentified That's good because we had at 16. at 12 and Power Wave at 15. Mark Mischeka - Bank of America Securities similar patters in March or do you expect Ericsson to become next quarter? Joe Porcello - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - Vice President of Finance No I think we're right now seeing things stand relatively where they are. Mark Mischeka - Bank of America Securities OK. Got you. And then a question on the 5M acquisition. It seemed like, you know, your gross margin took a hit because of that. Can you explain, is there some amortization or accounting that's going on there that goes away at some point? How should we look at that? 14 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

APRIL 25, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q3 2002 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call Lawrence Sala - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - President and CEO Well, what basically happened was that all this business interruption insurance that we've received for the fire was what has basically covered the expenses of the company for probably after we bought them were recognized in the purchase accounting. we have plenty of cash and if you look at their balance now they're still sitting on about $3.6 million dollars in cash and we're nine months out from the fire. So they're covering their expenses with the resources they received from the insurance company. But it was all recognized in terms of the revenue gaining back when we purchased the company. So now we're basically having expenses with significant revenues to off set the expenses. That's where you're getting your operating loss. And going forward until revenues rise to the prior levels, we're still going to suffer some kind of operating loss. We had 2.4 million dollar operating loss which has dropped to about one million dollars in quarter three and we expected the smaller improvements in quarter four because most of the are between two and three to put the factory back together. When you look at, if you lay the two against each other, Mark (ph) , when we recognize the gain of somewhere in $4 million to pay at the end of last quarter, we had estimated that that gain would cover their operating losses through probably September with a fairly conservative assumption of how revenue is gonna come back again. This quarter was actually a little bit better than we expected in terms of performance. So we have, you know, things are coming back a little bit better than we expected them to so far. The real telltale will be how in selling our technology and getting the revenue level up from here. So far it's operating better than we expected but if we had to recognize it as a one time gain and now we're taking in the operating losses . Mark Mischeka - Bank of America Securities Got you. OK. And then just on what gets revenue going back there again. Is this picking up some of the them actually giving design that Nokia . Joe Porcello - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - Vice President of Finance That's exactly it. That's where we're focusing first is on our big amplifier customers. They actually had relationship with Nokia prior to our involvement. We believe they have some fairly unique technology in building very cost effective high power amplifier microwave circuit boards. So we think their technology applies to all of our customers and that they have some pretty unique capabilities to do things competitors and that's getting anybody introduced to the market place. So I saw shorter selling cycles than a lot of the other products that we offer because they can come in, take the drawing and get into production within a matter of a month. They don't have to wait for designing cycles to get in and get going. So there is better opportunity to get the revenue rate up quickly than say products that we introduce that have to go through a new design cycle. Mark Mischeka - Bank of America Securities OK, great. Thanks for the explanation there. 15 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Operator Mike Lawcid (ph) of RBC Capital with our next question. Cliff Maldonado - RBC Capital Yes, hi, this is Cliff Maldonado (ph) for Mike Lawcid (ph) . I was wondering if you could review the competitive landscape for the . Unidentified We really don't see a big difference in landscape around the world. We pretty much deal with the same global competitors everywhere. We've been competitively I think like anything we're seeing, you know, see competition. A lot of people try to get into different product areas and try to do anything they can do to get their revenue rate up. But not a lot changing quarter to quarter in the competitive landscape. We're still seeing this . Cliff Maldonado - RBC Capital How about pricing pressure? Unidentified Well, you know, continues to be strong. Customers are all looking to enhance their margins. I'd say that changes in the marketplace has probably been more frequent. Price and negotiations with our customers, some customers wanting to negotiate every six months or even every quarter versus annually. But, you know, certainly more pressure than we saw even a year ago. Cliff Maldonado - RBC Capital What do you expect for for the next quarter? You know you mentioned you had some pressure on the margin. Do you expect to be ? Unidentified Somewhere around 20.12 percent of the sales. Somewhere in that . Cliff Maldonado - RBC Capital OK, thanks. 16 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

We'll hear now from Judson Copland (ph) of Morgan Family. Unidentified Hi. for Judson (ph) . How are you guys doing? Unidentified Good. Unidentified A couple quick questions. We didn't talk about Nokia too much on your core wireless business. But you did have a lot with those folks. Have you got any business attached to that? Unidentified Nothing substantially different. We do have a volume purchase agreement, we gained some share but it's off of obviously a very small paced, small customer of ours in the past. So they've pretty much called off the products to their forecast today. And not yet a large customer of ours. We would expect them next couple of quarters. Unidentified From the core business or for 5M or both? Unidentified From a core business. 5M is qualified hopefully by Nokia in this current quarter. They're actually visiting our 5M facility over the next couple of weeks I believe and hopefully we'll successfully complete the qualification with them. But it won't be after that that we start to see any kind of pick up at 5M. Unidentified OK. Could you quickly talk about your revenues from new products? Unidentified Our new products, well I guess that's how you define new products. As far as any of the new things that we've introduced in the last quarter or these breaking products, we don't expect to see revenue from them for at least another probably two quarters. Maybe some in our late third or fourth quarter of this calendar year. But the status . For us it's typically a nine month cycle to get new products in. 17 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

APRIL 25, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q3 2002 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call We're seeing a little bit of revenue earlier than we've ever seen it before. But whether it'll start to be a impact within the next quarter or two is yet to be seen. So maybe six months from the introduction we might see some production but nine months is more of the typical. The only other new thing this quarter was with the 3G adrenaline our first production of that product and probably at least a year. Unidentified What ? Unidentified We're seeing, you know, we've actually shipped reels of thousands of products out already even though we've just introduced that product a month and a half ago. So to our surprise, yes, some of the lower line products and some of the zinger circulator products, we're actually seeing a little bit of . But still we expect it to be another quarter or two before we see any steady significant production there. But that's pretty . In the past we -- typically it's been a longer time before we see products procured in those kind of volumes. Unidentified Why do you think that is for those two particular products? delay line. Unidentified I think it's because they're brand new concept products that offer savings, you know, appreciable savings over alternatives. So the delay line is very unique. There was never to our knowledge a product like that in the marketplace and it's substantially lower cost than alternatives that were out there. And similar with the zinger circulator, it's something brand new and fairly weak in the market. And so I think people are looking at it as a figure . Unidentified OK, and last question. Andrew Corporation announced the purchase of a company called Quasar (ph) yesterday. products. Can you give a sense for what you think that purchase or that category of product is placed within the . Unidentified To my knowledge is a lot more competitive with some of our older traditional products, case products than with anything that we really sell into the wireless marketplace today. I'm not super familiar with that product line. We never that I ever remember in our history running to them as a competitor or even considered an alternative to the things that we focus on. . 18 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

APRIL 25, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q3 2002 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call Unidentified And how or your new with our amplifiers or other components within the base station. What's kind of happening from the perspective and ? Unidentified Well we're, you know, we're definitely seeing the desire from to buy higher levels of assemblies. But for us it's really a potentially into a different customer. It's not really worth creating more opportunity for us or less so where as, you know, today we might sell to an amplifier manufacturer and we might sell to a manufacturer and we might sell to another sub-assembly manufacturer. As we go forward it's looking like that might be one big customer instead of three separate customers. But at the end of the day where we play in this food chain, we're still typically selling our components be it at L&A or combiner or at power amplifier. Unidentified You mentioned that they only wanted to buy higher level assemblies and one of your comments back at the was that you started to get some more of the signaling of base band signaling protocols from the . Is this the way that they're indicating that they want higher level assemblies by communicating some more of those protocols? Unidentified Not quite sure I fully understand your question. We're just saying that some of our customers sub systems rather than just so we're finding that, you know, our customers who might have just been doing a before or combiner or power amplifier before are now dabbling in all of those technologies and product areas and going after assemblies as opposed to just one piece. Unidentified Is there some kind of parallel behavior here appearing at the OEM's that you from your volume purchase agreement that is with that behavior from your customers? Unidentified No, I mean, from what we've seen in our limited view of the world, you know, our customers, you know, before they out sourced our and they out sourced filters and they out sourced L&A's. They still are, just might be trying to go to the one customer, one supplier instead of three different ones. And our customers traditionally build their own PA's or build their own filters, build their own L&A. They're still doing that. We haven't what they're doing. It's just how they're doing it and trying to find maybe one source instead of three different sources. Unidentified OK. That makes sense. Thank you very much. 19 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

APRIL 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q1 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call Our DSO and our contract business hit record lows in the first quarter. Worldwide e-commerce sales reached 488 million, on track to achieve $2 billion in 2002. We had strong operating results across all of our business segments. We added two new executives to our key management leadership team, a new CIO Patty Morrison, and a new CMO, Jocelyn Carter-Miller. We remain comfortable with our 2002 EPS growth target of 30 plus percent. On a consolidated sales basis, total first quarter revenue increased one percent, comparable worldwide sales declined one percent in the quarter. Our company-wide customer complaints dropped by 35 percent in the first quarter, our customer service indexes across all of our business segments increased. We did experience some softness in our European catalog operations, which I'll comment on when I get to international, and we continue to face strong U.S. dollar currency translation, which has the impact of impacting negatively our reported international sales and operating profits. On the comparable sales basis, retail comp sales were negative 1.7 percent for the first quarter, representing the fifth consecutive quarter of improving North America retail comp sales trends. The decline was still driven by a decline in hardware sales, with desktop and laptop computers comps dropping 18 percent, and overall technology sales were down 13 percent. Comp sales decreased 2.26 percent in our business services group during the first quarter of 2001, an improvement of negative 4 percent, in a similar period in the fourth quarter last year. Comp sales were somewhat soft across all customer size segments in BSG, excluding our e-commerce sales. These soft sales largely reflect the economic slowdown in medium and large contract accounts in the West in particular, and portions of the Central region. We continue to experience solid growth in the North and Southeast regions of the U.S. in our BSG business. International comparative sales were, grew four percent in local currencies in the first quarter. The strongest performance were in the Netherlands, Germany, Austria and Italy, with particular softness in the U.K., France and Japan. As we mentioned in our release this morning, we now anticipate some slowing of our historical high comp growth rates in our European catalog operations for the next few quarters, as a result of softer European economies, but somewhat offset by strong sales growth in France retail, and in the four countries where we have launched our new Office Depot Business Services Group. Our consolidated operating profit basis, as I said earlier, operating profit rose 69 percent to 164 million, from 97 million in 2001. Our North America retail operating profit achieved 7.6 percent, versus 4.3 percent in quarter one last year, and 6.2 percent -- 6.02 percent in quarter four. Our BSG group had its best ever quarter with Office Depot, with operating profit achieved at 9.9 percent of sales, in spite of negative comps. International division operating profit was almost 14 percent, versus 14.83 percent a year ago, despite softer catalog sales performance. Gross margin improvement more than offset our comparable sales softness. The biggest impact was in our North American retail business, where last year in the first quarter we had SKU rationalization. I'll comment more on that in the retail section. Lower levels of technology sales in North America retail also translate to a higher margin mix. We have for some time now, had more rational promotional activity, and we continue our intense focus on large contract account profitability. The key drivers of the operating profit expansion the first quarter, in addition to the gross margin increases, were that our BSG selling and operating costs improved by 224 basis points in the first quarter. As I said earlier, our customer service metrics substantially improved across all of our business segments. We did experience somewhat higher G&A costs, associated with international expansion to new countries, higher security and insurance costs as a result of the aftermath of September 11th, the inclusion of our new business forsure.com, their G&A costs in this quarter were not in the same quarter year ago, and some higher professional fees related to supply chain and merchandising initiatives that we're undertaking to even get better at supply chain, and higher bonus accruals to reflect our continued improvement in our performance metrics across all of our businesses. On a diluted gap reporting basis, EPS is 32 cents versus a first quarter year ago of 19 cents. Now let's talk about each of the business segments. North America retail sales -- as I said earlier, our fifth consecutive quarter of comparable sales improvement. Supplies continued to show improvement with positive comps overall on our supply business. Our first quarter product mix had furniture down four percent in the first quarter, versus 11 percent in the fourth quarter, some sign of improvement in that business. 3 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

APRIL 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q1 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call Overall technology hardware sales was down 13 percent in the quarter versus 25 percent in quarter four. It would appear to us that we may have bottomed out our decline in technology. Our software sales continue to be flattish. Average ticket in our North American retail business grew slightly in the quarter, an encouraging sign, and our average transactions were basically flattish. Our customer service index was up in our retail stores across our chain, as the benefits of our focus on making this a compelling place to shop continue to make shopping at Office Depot a better experience, evidenced by store complaints down again this quarter. This is the fifth or sixth consecutive quarter of improvement as we intentionally focus on making shopping at Office Depot a better place, and our average outs per store in spite of our inventory turn increases, and our supply chain efficiencies, actually went down in the first quarter this year, versus the first quarter of last year. Our North American operating profit in retail stores was up 289 basis points over the first quarter last year. Gross margins improved 312 basis points. Almost two-thirds of this gross margin improvement is directly attributable to the 2001 SKU rationalization we did in the first quarter of last year. The other third is changes in our promotional activity, becoming smarter about pricing and demand, and the continuing reflection of our improving margins in this business over the past four quarters. The balance of improvement is related to the continued mix shift, with softer technology sales, which have dropped from about 25 percent of our retail sales in 2000 to about 15 percent so far in 2002. As I said, I think that category has reached its bottom, and we now think there are opportunities, particularly in the second half of this year, to grow our share in technology on a profitable basis and recognize technology carries with it a very important market basket to Office Depot. Our store operating costs rose slightly in the quarter by 23 basis points. We continue tight control over our expenses, managing our payroll in a very difficult sales environment despite significant wage and healthcare benefit increases. We have flexed our payroll hours in response to softer sales, but we believe we are investing more payroll hours in our store model than our competitors, we believe that's why we're getting higher customer service levels, and we believe that leads to a better shopping experience. We have completed the roll out of our new store label model in almost 100 of our stores, we'll complete that roll out in the next quarter or two. We do expect to get savings as we've talked about. We're reinvesting part of those savings back in to better customer service to go along with the re-launch of our brand, which basically says what you need, and what you need to know, and we're investing our people so they get what they need to know to help customers. At the end of the first quarter we had 857 North America retail stores. We relocated two stores during the quarter, and closed two previously announced under-performing retail stores. Turning to our business service group sales, total sales in this sector increased one percent. As I said earlier, our contract division had strong growth in the Northeastern Southeast regions, but continued softness in the Western part of the United States and some parts of the Central region, in particular, Northern California continues to be heavily impacted by the decline in the technology industries of Northern California. We had, and continue to have, a very large presence in that sector, and that's been particularly soft for the last two or three quarters. Our revenue per order is down a bit from last year's levels, but rose slightly over the course of the first three months of this year. Again, another small sign of encouragement in terms of our delivery business, as our average order value went up slightly during the first quarter. Domestic e-commerce sales rose 35 percent. Our customer service indexes out of our North American delivery centers were their best ever, and rose to the highest levels in the history of Office Depot. Our warehouse customer complaints are down. Our call center complaints are down. Simply put, we're servicing customers better than we have ever in the past, and we're doing it with lower costs and that's a result of higher quality. Our operating profit in this segment was 9.9 percent for the first quarter, compared to 5.8 percent of last year. It is simply the best operating performance in our history in this segment. It improved by 402 basis points year over year. We had 178 basis point gross margin improvement in this business, as a result of our continued focus on contract pricing and account profitability. We do expect to see a slight reduction in gross margin percentage as we move through the balance of this year, as our growing national account sales begin to filter in to our sales mix. 4 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

APRIL 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q1 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call Our selling and operating costs were down 224 basis points versus last year. That's the result of the call center consolidation we completed last year, in which we said it would give us higher quality, better customer service and lower costs, and it has. And we also invested heavily last year in warehouse technology to improve quality and efficiency, and those improvements continue to flow through our operating expenses in spite of negative sales. March was the 15th consecutive month of record expense percentage in our North American warehouses. Our expenses per order continue to move down and we still believe that we can reduce our total warehouse operating costs year over year, by 100 basis points. The results could obviously be offset by a lack of sales leverage, but we're pretty proud of our performance in this segment, given the fact that we've been up against negative sales the last two quarters. As I said, our DSO in this segment was its best ever. It improved by six days. We tied this measurement to sales compensation, our sales force has responded positively. It's one of the reasons why our cash, our balance sheet, and our operating cash flow continue to remain strong. Internationally, total international sales in U.S. dollars were flat, and comp sales were down one percent. In local currencies, international sales rose five percent total, and comps four -- five percent a total increase, and comps rose four. Currency is still plaguing us. The strong U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales in this quarter by almost $20 million, and over $2 million of operating profit. We did see, in the quarters, some softness across most all of our European Viking catalog operations, and as I said earlier, with the largest impacts in the U.K. and France. Japan continues to under-perform as a result of their economy which remains in our viewpoint, in disarray. While we are seeing softness in our international catalog businesses, our BSD contract sales are still meeting or exceeding our initial plans in each of the four new countries in which we have an Office Depot BSD presence. Our retail business in France continues to encourage us. Comps in our French retail business in local currencies were up seven percent. We will open eight new stores this year, down slightly from our earlier target only because we're making certain we find great retail locations. We did have negative retail comps in Japan, down nine percent in the quarter in local currency. We did open two new Japanese stores in the first quarter, bringing us now to a total of 11 stores in Japan. In spite of that softness, our first quarter operating profit internationally was 14 percent, albeit down 80 basis points from last year. Gross margins in this business are trending strong, up 51 basis points despite the addition of a growing retail business in France, our introduction of our BSD contract business in four countries, and our new prospecting efforts in our two newest countries, Switzerland and earlier this quarter, in Spain. We believe we'll continue to buy better throughout Europe as we leverage our supply chain, and we're making better use of our global purchasing, our global brand, and our emphasis on private label throughout international and domestic businesses. Our store and warehouse operating costs increased in this business 131 basis points in the first quarter, reflecting the addition of the start-up costs in Switzerland, which we opened in early January, costs associated with the launch of Spain, which we opened during the first week of April, and three new countries which we have an Office Depot BSD presence that weren't in our numbers in the first quarter year ago. While softness in Japan did result in negative retail comps, we did improve our operating performance in Japan, and our losses this quarter were about $800,000 less than in the same quarter a year earlier, as we get our arms around our operating model in Japan. We still generate losses, we're still optimistic about Japan in the long term, we opened two stores and we're making progress, albeit we're still losing money in Japan. As I said earlier, we began operations in Switzerland early January, with encouraging results. We launched Spain with a direct-mail Viking business the first week of April, and we are very encouraged by our first week of results. First week's not a quarter, not a year, but we've got some encouraging signs about Spain. And we continue to invest, and will continue to invest, in this high performing, high return on asset, high return on sales business, as it still remains a key growth vehicle for our company in the future. In summary, we simply had strong performance across all of our business segments. We believe this proves the sustainability of all the actions we've taken to improve our business model that began over 18 months ago. All of this consistently improving performance has been achieved 5 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

APRIL 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q1 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call during a very challenging and difficult economic environment. Our balance sheet has never been better, our operating cash flows are strong, and we now have more access to more capital to grow our business than we've had in the past. During the quarter we successfully completed a $600 million credit facility over three years, which gives us the ability to have cash and credit to grow and invest in our business. We've enhanced our executive management team through the addition of two new outstanding executives, a CIO and a CMO, and we also added two new impressive board members to our already great board of directors. The consistency of our earnings performance has proven that when revenue overall begins to grow, we are able and capable, and have the physical discipline and controls to accelerate our earnings growth capacity. As I said at the beginning of the call, we do remain confident in our ability to grow earnings in 2002, in the 30 percent range. As we look forward to 2003, we must see acceleration in our sales growth to sustain future earning growth and trends, and this organization is highly focused on finding new ways to grow. We have lots of new ideas, we have a number of new tests, none of them are at a stage where we're ready to talk about them, but we are focused on growing our business, growing market share in North America, continuing our market share growth outside the United States. We are seeing some early signs of small improvements in the domestic economy, somewhat offset by the softness in our European catalog operations. As I said earlier, in the quarter we saw a small up tick in our average order size in our North America retail stores. We saw our technology sales, while declining, to be the lowest level of decline in the last five quarters. We've seen a small improvement in average order size in our North America contract business, and we continue to make improvements in our cost structure in spite of lower sales volumes. In summary, we think we had a great quarter. We still are focused on improvement, we have an organization dedicated to make Office Depot the most compelling place to work, shop and invest, in our sector, and as I said, now almost two years ago, I wouldn't bet against this company in the long term, and I still wouldn't do it. On that basis, I'd like to turn the call over to all of you for any questions you might have about the quarter and the comments I've just made. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Operator And at this time we'll be in the question and answer portion of today's call. If you would like to ask a question, press star, one on your touch-tone phone pad. If you are using speaker equipment, you may need to lift your handset prior to pressing star one. To withdraw your question, press star two. Once again that is star one to ask a question, and star two to withdraw your question. And our first question comes from Bill Julian (ph) of Salomon Smith Barney. Bill Julian - Salomon Smith Barney Thanks. Good morning Bruce. Let me start just by asking for a point of clarification. When you talk about 30 percent earnings growth for 2002 with no improvement in the domestic economy, are you essentially saying you can do that without any sales growth in your North American businesses? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO No. What I'm saying is that I don't -- I think the 30 percent growth comes on with the outlook we have for the second half of the year. And that basically says we believe our North America retail comps, when we finish 2002, will be basically neutral. We had negative 1.7 in the first quarter. We believe that we're anniversarying (ph) some softer retail comps. We believe that technology has somewhat bottomed. We think we'll see an uplift in that in the second quarter. So we're saying if the economy stays the way it is, it doesn't go up much, and it doesn't go down, we're 6 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

APRIL 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q1 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call confident of our ability, given the sales levels we've anticipated in each of our business segments, that we will deliver this year the 30 percent plus growth in our, in our EPS. Should we get an uplift in the economy, we think it's more than that, I'm just not today ready to sit back and say we're ready to tell you that the economies turned itself around. As in the past, I plan on a mid-quarter update towards the end of May, when I'll give all of you more color and insight into our performance in the second quarter. And I'll give you a better feel again, but basically what we're saying Bill (ph) is the economy stays the same, this is the earning capacity of the company, if sales were to begin to accelerate, our earning capacity can accelerate. Bill Julian - Salomon Smith Barney OK, that's fair. You're obviously pushing up against old high-water margins, and pushing beyond them. Can you comment a little bit on how far you think those might go over the next couple of years? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Well I think that on the gross margin side, I think we've got one quarter left, this one, in which the delta between the quarter a year ago and this quarter will be fairly significant. Again, we're anniversarying the SKU rationalization we did in our retail stores, we very basically re-merchandised our entire chain in the second quarter of last year. I said that would lead to higher margins, better mix, a better market basket and it has. We anniversaryed that starting in the third quarter. We also have been more disciplined about our pricing, we've used our data warehouse to be smarter about our pricing, we've focused on our contract account profitability. I think our margin levels beyond the second quarter are sustainable outside of mix changes, either technology mix or some contract mix. I don't look for gross margin expansion after the second quarter compared to previous quarters. The -- any change will be a mix change. And be small changes. Bill Julian - Salomon Smith Barney OK, thank you. Operator And our next question comes from Dan Wewur (ph) of Deutsche Bank Alex Brown. Dan Wewur - Deutsche Bank Alex Brown Good morning. Question on the business service group, at the end of 2001 that division was generating a margin of about 7.9 percent which was always thought to be the high-water mark potential in that business. Clearly with the results you achieved in the first quarter we have to rethink the ultimate profitability in BSG. Now Bruce when you think about the art of the possible, you know, how high is high now in BSG? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO I think that Dan (ph) , that's a good question Dan (ph) . I think that clearly we had a great quarter performance. We're continuing to anniversary improvements that we started to make -- those improvements have accelerated so some of the improvement gets more difficult, second and third quarter, because we've made drastic changes in this company for the positive. I think this business is still, and I've said all along, I think it's an eight to a nine percent business. 7 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

APRIL 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q1 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call You say, well geeze it was 9.9 in the first quarter, well I've said all along, we're going to use some of our efficiencies and some of our leverage in improvements to try and grow our business. We backed a little bit away from the large account segment a year and a half ago, I wasn't comfortable about our ability to do it profitably. I am today. That tends to have a lower gross margin mix with it, and tends to come with it a little operating cross reduction compared to medium and smaller sized accounts. The other point is, there's a point where frankly, I mean you may not want to hear this as a shareholder, but this business can get too profitable, it creates an umbrella, I don't want to invite. But this is still, you know, a plus eight percent business, we've said it all along, I still think it is, I don't think it's a ten percent business. I think if we get it to that point we'll use our buying power which we think we have, our efficiency which we think we've got, and we'll be more aggressive on market share account by account, and do it smartly. But this is a eight percentage, eight percentish operating performance business. Dan Wewur - Deutsche Bank Alex Brown Well just if I follow up, just one question on that. You know in the past you've talked about being rational on pricing for contract accounts. I think they've been how you've talked about, you know, trying to get a 21 or 22 percent margin on that business. Given that you've made so much progress in reducing your cost structure, could you not get more competitive in pricing for the contract accounts, and thereby enhancing your top line? And still, you know, get that eight or nine percent division margin? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Pricing for contract accounts is somewhere between an art and a science. I've been in this business a long time, and you have to look an account by account basis in addition to pricing Dan (ph) you've got to look at the service requirements of the accounts, some accounts you can take lower margins and make money based on their service requirements, some accounts are higher margins. I just think this segment is an opportunity up for us to grow share in. As I said, we over the last year have been reluctant to go at it heavily. We've added some resources to it, it's partly reflected in our G&A costs, as we've added sales resource to this channel. I don't, I don't, I don't mean to portray we're going to get irrational on pricing, because we're not. This is a company driven to get return on assets, return on net assets and profitability. We'll do it wisely, we'll do it smartly, we'll do it account by a time, we'll do it strategically. And this is, this is a segment that we're investing in because we believe we can generate good margins, good roll (ph) up, but to talk about pricing strategy in a broad aspect beyond that isn't appropriate for a call like this. I -- rationality is important to all of us, but where we can, we want to grow our business, and we're focused on growing that business. Dan Wewur - Deutsche Bank Alex Brown Great. Thanks a lot. Good luck. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Thanks. Operator And our next question comes from Erin Rubinson (ph) of UBS Warburg. 8 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

APRIL 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q1 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call Erin Rubinson - UBS Warburg Hey guys, two questions on the sales side. Number one, you talked about, while the comps were down 1.7 percent at retail, you mentioned furniture was down four, technology was down 13, and then at least in the body of the release it says a number of core office supply category comps were positive. What was I guess, north of the minus 1.7 to have pulled it up that much given you've only given us the categories that were low? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Well, I would answer generally are -- first of all, just kind of a parenthetical for a minute, I think we tend to break out more details about our business than any of our competitors by product category. I don't want to go beyond what I've broken out. Furniture and technology are important because they're high-ticket items, they're somewhat indicative of the economy. Needless to say, if you do the math, and I'm now telling technology the way I define it, which is laptops, desktops, monitors, printers, digital cameras, are now 15 percent of our North America retail mix, down from 25 almost a year ago. I say if you do some math on that, you'll find that our, that over half our business is core office supplies, and by definition in totality, you have to be comping up. It doesn't mean every category is comping up because it's not, but the, but we got, but the core of our supply business, our basic supply business is obviously positively comping. It varies by category. As much as all of you would like to know exactly by category, I'm not prepared to talk at it more category than what I already do. It's already, as I said, more than most of our competitors do. Erin Rubinson - UBS Warburg OK. And then on the average ticket and transaction, you mentioned that your ticket was a little bit better. Is that average selling price, or reduction in deflation versus items per transaction, and on the transaction side would you have thought that your transaction count would be up, given your new ad campaign? And then I'm done. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO OK, thanks Erin (ph) . You know, because averages get you in serious trouble when you look across the chain of the number of transactions we have in retail. I don't think we've seen any real price degration in technology. The average items tends to be about the same as it's been. I think it's a very small encouraging sign at this moment, but in the aggregate, our customers when they aggregate up, are buying a little bit more. Two, as it relates to your comment about an ad campaign. We re-launched our brand, what we stand for, we're three months into that re-launch. I don't think that you can measure a brand and advertising in a three-month period of time, as to whether it drives transactions or traffic. Frankly one of the things about some, companies like Office Depot where we have multiple channels, our brand advertising has the impact of far more than just retail. Clearly it helps our e-commerce sales, clearly it helps our small to medium sized account sales. So I think from our perspective we're pleased today with the performance of our ads. It's still early in the process. We've got some new ones coming out for back to school and holiday, but I think branding and advertising is a long-term thing, not a month-to-month, quarter to quarter thing. Somebody once said you waste 50 percent of what you advertise you just don't know where you waste it. That's probably a true statement. But overall I think our advertising campaign is doing what we it to do, three months in to what we plan for it to do both internally and externally. Erin Rubinson - UBS Warburg Thanks Bruce. 9 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

APRIL 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q1 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call Operator And our next question comes from Matthew Fessler (ph) of Goldman Sachs. Matthew Fessler - Goldman Sachs Thanks a lot. Excuse me, good morning. Just a couple of quick questions here. First of all Bruce, to get a little more specific about your earnings potential of BSG, clearly you delivered expenses at a lower level than you've seen at any point in time recently. Is there anything seasonal about the rest of the year that would suggest that the expense ratio would need to be any higher than it was in the first quarter? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO The only seasonal thing is we get into leverage Matt (ph) . We do get our first quarter tends to be, in BSG, one of our higher quarters in absolute sales performance. One of the things that we said, I said, we would do 18 months ago, is we'd prove to all of you that there is such a thing in our warehouse's fixed and variable costs. 18 months ago all of our costs, up to 100 percent variable, revenue went up 20 percent, costs went up 20 percent. We do have a fixed element of our costs in our North American warehouses, and as the absolute sales dollars in a quarter decline, not necessarily in comps, but just in quarter, it gets more difficult to leverage and therefore the expenses as a percentage get different. If you're asking do I think we're going to keep our handle on absolute dollar costs, absolutely I do. And I still think there's improvement left in our North American business. This comes at a time by the way, when we're getting enormous pressure on delivery costs. I mean, delivery costs in the form of the aftermath of September 11th still means that the carriers that deliver packages for us, and our own delivery systems are more expensive and we've gotten this improvement even facing that pressure. So I think its impact is based on leverage, if you will, as quarters vary somewhat in their total revenue. Matthew Fessler - Goldman Sachs Now just to make sure that we understand the direction in which BS, business system moving, you talked about some softness on the West coast, but nonetheless it appears as if your same location growth in this business is a bit better than it was in the fourth quarter. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO It is an improvement over the fourth quarter levels. Matthew Fessler - Goldman Sachs OK, so ... Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO ...financial statement. Matthew Fessler - Goldman Sachs So it's not as if we have to fight the tide of eroding business condition in BSG as we think about the expense ratio? 10 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

APRIL 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q1 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Yeah, I think, this is a business I think that's significantly impacted by the overall domestic economy, and in particular, the outlook of the Fortune 300 accounts, Fortune three or 400 size accounts that either grow and add on people, or they continue to lay people off, and so this is still a business because of the large account segment, that's highly dependent upon a better North American economy, and I don't pretend to be able to understand the economy well enough to be able to give you more insight. I just think we've got some larger accounts that will come into our business now, beginning in the second quarter. These are wins that we got late last year. I think that's going to help our business somewhat. So we've got improving trends in this segment sequentially for each of the next three quarters. We believe the comps if you will, sequentially in the second quarter will be better than the first, third better than the second, and fourth better than the third. Part of that's the anniversarying and part of that's some things we think we're doing. Matthew Fessler - Goldman Sachs Got you ... Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO And that's not anticipating a huge benefit from an improving North America domestic economy. Matthew Fessler - Goldman Sachs Now, say that's what's in the contract business which you've been discussing, it seems like you are refocusing to some degree on the large national accounts. What kind of competitive environment do you find yourself stepping into in that business, and how does it compare with where it's been over the past couple of years? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO I would say it's a very strong competitive environment. We've got three very strong competitors that are good at what they do. I mean this is a scratch, dig and claw business. You've got to earn the business one account at a time, and you've got to do it with a total package that goes beyond price. I think it's a relatively rational marketplace in totality. You clearly get some marquis accounts in this business segment, that irrationally takes place on a marquis account or two. But overall I think the competitive nature of this business is that all of us want to deliver shareholder returns, at least it appears that way in the public stuff they all talk about, and I mean BT, or Corporate Express, excuse me, Boise Cascade and Staples. So I don't, I think it's a more consolidated environment than it was three years ago. Sure there's some people that aren't here, that were here three years ago. It's a tough environment, it's a competitive environment, we've got great competitors. And I think we've got to, I think we can, I think we can grow share in this segment. Matthew Fessler - Goldman Sachs My final question. You find yourself here at the end of the first quarter with an awful lot of cash. If your stock continues to do well, and your convert is not put to you later this year, you're going to find yourself sitting on more than you might have expected just a few months ago. You know, what is your plan for deploying that cash, it's certainly more you can deploy in the existing business, there's not a lot of, there's not a lot of bank debt to take out here, so are you thinking about buying back additional stock -- what would your deployment look like? 11 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

APRIL 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q1 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Well first of all I want you to know this is a very high quality problem. Matthew Fessler - Goldman Sachs Fair enough. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Somewhat different than I faced 18 months ago, had some other problems that weren't high quality ones. This one is a high quality one. Two is, it's not a long history yet, it's a couple of quarters. There is, without getting specific, I do think there are opportunities to grow this business both domestically and outside the United States that may require some use of our cash. Fourth, I am, and we are committed as a company to improve our credit ratings. I've said that 18 months ago, we have continuous dialog with the credit rating agencies. I want them to look at Office Depot and I want them to say these, this company has earned a higher credit rating. That takes a pristine balance sheet, cash. As it relates to the long-term thing, what you do with cash, the reality is as I've said before, this executive group of managers is committed to growing shareholder value. Period. If you want to see how that works, take a look at our proxy where we think we have aligned the interests of shareholders very much with the interests and the motivation of our leadership. And we will use that cash in one way or another, over a period of time, to drive shareholder value. Period. Matthew Fessler - Goldman Sachs Thank you very much. Thanks a lot. Operator And our next question comes from Colin McLanahan (ph) of Sanford Bernstein. Colin McLanahan - Sanford Bernstein Hey Bruce, was hoping you could give us maybe a little bit more color on Europe. What's the situation kind of look like on the ground there, any sense of when you think comps might improve? And then longer term, you know, kind of the BSD question as well, you knew you'd talked about that being a 13 to 15 percent operating margin business. Is there any change in the pace of investment you're planning that would impact that outlook? And then again, longer term any change in thinking the pace of the growth for Europe? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO OK, several questions. The first one is, when do I think comps are going to improve in North America retail. Colin (ph) I've been working at this for 18 months and haven't got it right yet. Colin McLanahan - Sanford Bernstein Bruce, international, not in A.R. 12 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

APRIL 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q1 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO International? Well, you know, first of all this softening that took place in the first quarter is really the first signs of some softening across the continent in Europe. And it's across most the countries so I know it's not operational, I know it's not executional. Our own view at the moment is that's at least for the next two quarters that we'll see that softness in our catalog business. As I, as we commented in our release, I think we can mitigate some of that softness through our growing BSD business. From our own perspective that softness is likely to put a two to three, two to three cent pressure on our own numbers about profitability to give you the magnitude of it. We think we can make some of -- by that, that includes the continued currency issues that we have. If you'd have said to me I thought we'd have a euro of 88 or 86 cents right now I'd have said no way. Colin McLanahan - Sanford Bernstein Didn't think so either. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Yeah, so, I don't like -- that continues to impact the translation results. So I think some softness, at least for the next two quarters in our own forecast throughout Europe and the rest of the world in the Viking catalog model. This had offset by the growing BSD presence. To your question about invest in the long-term, this is still a 13 plus percent return on investment, or return on sales business over time. We continue Colin (ph) to look for ways to grow in Europe. I've said all along it's a market that's larger than the U.S., it's more fragmented. I believe there are opportunities to accelerate growth in Europe, either by accelerating the entry of new countries, and/or looking at opportunities to maybe acquire in certain segments. Retail is not our primary strategy in Europe. We do have a retail strategy in France, that we're delighted and excited about. We're investing in it. So I think, I think we have a lever called how much do we want to spend how fast. We do have a commitment to grow shareholder value, we have to blend that always. And so we'll accelerate sometimes, we'll slow down sometimes, particularly our entry into new countries. I mean at one point we had plans to enter another new country late this year. We've moved that off a little bit, probably more until next year, as a result of the softness we've seen, plus our desire to continue to generate consistently improving results. This is a business we're proud of, it's a business we make a lot of money in, it's a high return on net asset business, it too has very positive cash flow. Our building cash balances are not only domestically, they're internationally. This is a good business segment, we think we know how to manage it and lead it. We'll grow our share in it over a period of time. It still represents a unique opportunity for Office Depot and frankly, differentiates us in terms of growth from our two primary superstore competitors in North America. Colin McLanahan - Sanford Bernstein Thanks Bruce. Operator And our next question comes from Gary Bolter (ph) of Credit Suisse First Boston. 13 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

APRIL 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q1 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call Brian Nagle - Credit Suisse First Boston Hi this is Brian Nagle (ph) for Gary Bolter (ph) . I just have a couple of quick basic questions. First off, your tax rate in the quarter was 35 percent versus 37 percent a year ago. Should we be using that rate going forward now? And what's the reason for the decline? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO The answer is, as Charlie Brown, my CFO just nodded yes. That is the neighborhood of the tax rate that you ought to use going forward. I'll let him comment as to why that is. Charles Brown - Office Depot, Inc. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer It's really the benefit from our international tax planning. And as our international income becomes a bigger part of our total income, that allows us to move our tax rate down, so this rate of 35 percent should be used for the year. Brian Nagle - Credit Suisse First Boston So is that 35 ... Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO I do, I might add by the way, that with the dramatic improvement in our stock price, we're getting a little more dilution that we planned in our calculation of shares outstanding. If you remember right, this is a company 18 months ago that had 85 percent of its options under water. As the stock has grown more rapidly than frankly most of us anticipated, we hoped for it but didn't anticipate it. We do have some offsetting dilution in EPS calculations as we've got more shares coming into the base as a result of, as the result of improving stock price. We do have to remind all of you an authorized $50 million buyback on our stock and we're at the end of the first quarter, about 20 some million into that buyback. We continue to buy that back incrementally, it's meant to offset dilution, we frankly have dilution in shares coming at a faster rate than our buying back stock, again it's another high quality problem. Brian Nagle - Credit Suisse First Boston So Charlie, you guys were planning for the 35 percent tax rate at the beginning of the quarter? Charles Brown - Office Depot, Inc. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes. Brian Nagle - Credit Suisse First Boston OK. 14 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

APRIL 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q1 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO In that neighborhood. I mean, appreciate you can't get a tax rate down to a basis point, but we were planning in the neighborhood of 35, 36. I mean you get done at the end of a quarter, that's a, I don't think you can be so finite to say it was 35. Were we planning for a slightly lower tax rate? Yes. Eileen Dunn - Office Depot, Inc. - Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations Brian (ph) it's Eileen. I think most analysts have 35 percent in their models now. Brian Nagle - Credit Suisse First Boston OK, great. Thanks. And the other question is, could someone comment on this, but could you talk about the trend of retail comps as the quarter progressed? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO The tend as the quarter progressed ... Brian Nagle - Credit Suisse First Boston The trend. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Yeah. Brian Nagle - Credit Suisse First Boston The trend in retail comps. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Yeah, if you look at January, February, March, progressive improvement. So each month was a little better than the previous month. So March was the best comp trend in the first quarter. Meaning less negative than the quarter in total. January was the worst comps in comparison. So improving trend. Brian Nagle - Credit Suisse First Boston Great. OK, thanks a lot. Operator And our next question comes from Danielle Fox (ph) of J.P. Morgan. 15 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

APRIL 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q1 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call Danielle Fox - J.P. Morgan Thank you, good morning. Could you comment on the 2Q outlook for EPS, and just your general expectations for comps by segment? You mentioned easier comparisons and I'm wondering when this year you expect the two-year comp trend to turn? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Yeah Danielle (ph) I think that, I'm not -- the thing, all of you as analysts have done your best job to take a look at the second quarter. The consensus of the quarter right now sits at 20 cents. I don't have any change from that direction to give you. I will, as I said earlier, we will, as I said earlier, towards the end of May give all of you our traditional mid-quarter update. At that time, I'll give you insight into comps across business segment, I'll give you insight into earnings trends for the quarter, I'll get more precise if I can on EPS for the second quarter, but I'm going to save those comments until the end of May. But needless to say, remaining comfortable with 30 percent growth targets for 2002 by definition I'm comfortable with the growth targets for the second quarter. Danielle Fox - J.P. Morgan OK, and just a kind of broader question about the full year, about you know, just the two year comp trend given the easing comparisons when we'll actually see an improvement in the, in the two year comp trend for the total company or any of the individual segments? Obviously international is a little bit weaker. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Well, yeah, I think what we sell, you have to do by business segment. Danielle Fox - J.P. Morgan Yeah. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO The second quarter retail will be better comps than the first. The third quarter could be about the same, maybe a little worse than comps than the second. We got a back to school anniversary we did extremely well on. That directionally is the same. We think our fourth quarter retail will be our best comps in quite some time, and they'll be positive. And that gets you to basically neutral for the year. We said earlier our BSG comps we anticipate quarter by quarter improvement in the BSG business. International, we in spite of the softness, we do anticipate better comps in the second quarter. That's got to do with mailing plans, holidays in Europe and a variety of other things, and a growing BSD business and the growing impact of our two new countries, Switzerland and Spain. And we think those comps continue to improve throughout the year, and when you get done with the year we think on comp basis for the year, we'll be in the neighborhood of, hold on a sec here. For year comp for the company. Yeah, a couple points -- well let me -- Danielle (ph) we'll get back to you off line on that. Danielle Fox - J.P. Morgan That'd be great. 16 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

APRIL 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q1 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO That segment and I don't, I haven't looked at how that rolls up yet. Eileen Dunn - Office Depot, Inc. - Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations Rolls up to a total sales growth for the year of around mid-single digits. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO A total sales growth mid-single digits for the company for the year. Danielle Fox - J.P. Morgan OK, great. Thanks very much. Operator And our next question comes from Jack Belos (ph) of Midwood (ph) Research. Jack Belos - Midwood Research Hi. Regarding the office supply business, just that category in total. What's been the trend in sales in that category this quarter and the past few quarters? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Well I think as our, as our negative comps have declined in North America retail, since we completed the re-merch and the SKU and the rationalization we completed in the second quarter in North America last year, we said that that would drive better comps and better margins, and our supply categories have positively improved sequentially third quarter, fourth quarter, first quarter. So we continue to see directionally signs of that business improving. I think that's a couple of things. I think one is that when we did re-merchandise our stores, we got adjacent fees better than we ever had them before. And that's when a customer buys a low margin item like a one inch black binder, they often buy some indexes or other labels to go with it that tend to be higher margin items, and that drives comps. Second of all, we've been focused on driving comps in our core business, and so improving trends sequentially to answer your question. Jack Belos - Midwood Research Would you quantify that in terms of being low single-digit improvement in this quarter? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO No, I won't Jack (ph) only because I said, I said earlier, we quantify far more than our competitors. Directionally our supply sales are positive, they're not positive in every category -- I'm not trying to hide, it's just directionally I'm trying to give you direction. As I said, I don't want to get into the point where we're talking about comp trends by category. 17 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

APRIL 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q1 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call I talk about furniture and technology because they're such high-ticket items, they have such a big impact on the company, they've had a negative impact far greater than anything else on comps. I'll continue to talk about those in the future, and lump the rest of our product sales in our retail into a large basic category called basic office supplies. Jack Belos - Midwood Research Regarding the roll out of the payroll scheduling. How many stores did you say that's in currently, and when do you expect to have the entire chain that way? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO It's 100 plus stores, and we'll have the entire roll out done by late May, early June. Jack Belos - Midwood Research Oh, OK. Thank you very much. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO You're welcome. Operator And at this time I would like turn the conference over to Miss Eileen Dunn and Mr. Bruce Nelson for closing comments. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Thanks for taking your valuable time to listen to our results for the first quarter. As I said, I think I'm encouraged by all the progress the company's made over the past 18 months. I think you can see it in consistency, I think you can see it in quality, I think you can see it in our results. We're still faced with some uncertainty in a domestic economy, some softness in the European economy, in spite of that we continue to do well. Our ability to accelerate earnings growth beyond the 30 percent is, as many of you pointed out, dependent on increasing growth here in North America. We see some signs of it, hopefully that will continue. We will give you more insight to that at the, towards the end of May. In the meantime, this is a management team committed to making Office Depot the most compelling place to work, shop and invest. We think we've done an admirable job of improving our metrics. We continue to focus on the things that drive shareholder value. That's what it's about. Thanks for listening and thanks for your support. Operator Thank you for attending Office Depot's first quarter 2002 earnings conference call, and have a good day. 18 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

TRANSCRIPT Operator Good afternoon and welcome to Noranda Incorporated First Quarter 2002 Earnings Results Conference Call. During the presentation all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question and answer session. At that time, if you have a question, please press the one, followed by the four on your telephone. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday April 24, 2002. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kerr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir. DAVID KERR Thank you very much, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to everyone. Joining me in Noranda boardroom today are Derek Pannell, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Aaron Regent, our Chief Financial Officer. There are also some other operating people in the room who will be available for questions and discussions as they go in that direction. As you may have read, Noranda reported earnings for the first quarter of $1 million, which is a loss of 2 cents per share, after taking into account-preferred dividend. And, while this is far from ideal, I would like to point to the turnaround that this represents when you look at the cash operating margin, which has increased despite lower metal prices. We've been able to record an increase an increase in cash operating margin because we have increased production across virtually all of our business. When compared to the first quarter of 2001, an impressive 73 percent increase in mined copper, 22 percent in mined zinc, and 8 percent in mined nickel. These were, in turn, as a result of the intensive capital investment of the program we've had over the past five years and are now making an impact on our bottom-line Also impacting our bottom line has been improved performance in American Racing Equipment and Aaron will just discuss the other new strategy is making this difference. We also raised $400 million cash in the past quarter, just past the end of this quarter when it will close through the sale of 45 percent of the Noranda Income Fund, which owes all of the CEZinc refinery. And, the refinery, as you know, has been a consistently outstanding performer. This allows us to raise a sizable amount of capital to enhance our financial flexibility while still maintaining an interest in an add-operative facility. We've been active in getting Falcon Bridge and Noranda to work more closely together on areas that make sense, such as with our copper operation and in certain corporate functions. It has been a period of intense activity at Noranda, and these efforts, combined with our improved asset base, have put in Noranda in an excellent position to benefit from an improvement in metal prices and the economy. On that note, I will ask Aaron if he would take us through the financial picture that he has. AARON REGENT Great. Thank you, David. If I could speak first of the net earnings slide, which is part of the presentation that has been distributed, the cash operative margin, as David highlighted was 252 million in the quarter compared to $199 million last year. Later in the presentation, I'll walk through a breakdown of the various components of the cash operating margin. Below that line, depreciation and amortization expense increased from where we were last year really reflects an increase in the production base of the company the corresponding higher depreciation charges that goes with it. Our other expenses increased from last year as well, many as a result of higher interest expense as we stopped capitalizing interest against a number of our projects, and, also -- which was somewhat offset by a lower interest rate. Overall, our earnings for the quarter were $1 million, compared to $24 million last year. If I could turn to the next slide, this next slide highlights the main variances between this quarter versus last year. You'll see that metal prices, on a comparable bases were lower than last year and reduced earnings by $32 million. This was offset by -- partially offset by increased volumes, particularly from the contributions from Antamina, Lomas Bayas, offset somewhat by the Falcondo operations, which were partially idled during the quarter. Foreign exchange was positive compared to last year. And, the other line, which are costs, was really higher interest expense compared to last year. The first quarter of last year there were also some unusual items we, in the first quarter this year, we really didn't have any notable unusual items. Last year, we just want to remind people that there was a U.S. tax recovery of approximately $39 million, which positively impacted our results in the first quarter of last year. 2 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

APRIL 24, 2002 / 8:00PM, FAL_pa.TO^G08 - Q1 2002 NORANDA INC Earnings Conference Call Similarly, the strike at Sudbury operations negatively impacted our results on a comparable basis, that cost the company about $30 million. Metal prices, compared this quarter versus last year, we're down significantly across the board. I think zinc was down 22 percent, copper down 12 percent, nickel down 5 percent and aluminum down 12 percent. So, you can see the impact that that has had on our results. If I could now turn to the slide which is headed the cash operating margin, I'll walk through the various components of these. Overall, our cash operating margins were 27 percent higher than last year. Turning first to the copper group, this includes the, essentially, the South American operations of the company, the Antamina mine, the Collahausi mine, Lomas Bayas mine and the Altonorte smelter. We look at the copper group; copper sales volumes and operating margins increased significantly, primarily as a result of the contributions from Antamina and Lomas Bayas. If I could turn to Antamina first to make a few comments, Antamina contributed 29 million to our cash operating margins, or $13 million to our earnings in the quarter. The contribution from Antamina was positive, but lower than we had anticipated for a few explainable reasons. First, the copper zinc production was below what we anticipated with the lower head grades and recoveries. Really a result of the discrepancy in the mining of different benches than planned, as well as the mining of additional but economic lower grade ore that was incognita from undrilled areas, which was previously assumed to be waste. Cash operating costs were 41 cents per pound, also a bit higher than what we had anticipated, because of, principally, because of lower byproducts revenues, really lower zinc revenues from lower zinc production and lower zinc prices were the main reasons. Collahausi contributed $32 million to earnings, which was slightly below last year despite a significant reduction in copper prices. This was due to a strong performance of the mine, both on a production side, as well as lowering unit cost, which helped to mitigate a lower realized copper price. Lomas Bayas also contributed quite positively to our first quarter results. A cash operating margin of 15 million, the earnings contribution was $9 million, what exceeded what our expectations were. Net operating cash costs of 46 cents per pound, which is very competitive with many other mines of the world. Altonorte experienced a formally known negative operating margin, which is -- always coming out positive, but it was better than last year. The operating margin reflected lower volumes but were partially offset by lower site costs. Our production targets were slow what we anticipated due to the delay in the start-up in the reactor and associated equipment related to the phase 3A expansion of Altonorte. This equipment began operating on March 13 versus our original plan of January 1, but I can see that that reactor start-up is proceeding well and it's expected to reach plan operating parameters in the second quarter. I'd like to turn to our zinc group. Zinc group had a loss of $9 million in the quarter, compared to earnings of $3 million last year. This is quite a significant achievement, particularly when you look at the fact that zinc prices declined by 22 percent over the comparable period and the zinc group were able to partially offset the substantial reduction in the zinc price by lowering the unit cost by almost 7 cents per pound compared to last year. Our primary aluminum operations margin were below last year, due primarily to lower aluminum prices, which was also partially offset by lower until costs. Indiscernible) volumes continuing to increase with the ramp-up of a single-piece anode project. We expect for this to continue throughout the balance of the year. In our aluminum foil our foil results were below last year. Shipments of foil were 8 percent higher than last year, but below what we had anticipated due the continued softness in the foil market. Fabrication spreads also declined due to a lighter gage product mix and also a softer market for value-added products. Turning to our nickel operation, nickel operating margins were $26 million compared to $1 million last year. Nickel sales volumes from I&O were significantly higher than last year. Last year, you will recall was affected by the strike in Sudbury. The ferronickel product was lower this year as a result of the shutdown of Falcondo. Falcondo has restarted operating in February and was in full operating in March. Our Canadian copper recycling business, this next slide highlights really the Canadian operations with the exception of Kidd. I have a separate slide on Kidd. When we look at our results our operating margins were essentially comparable to last year. Production levels were on or ahead of plan. Results continue to reflect the mix of feed materials, and generally lower realized margins due to a decline in recycle fees. However, we were able to partially offset this by the treatment of higher complex materials, which also has higher margins. The first part of the results were also positively impacted by our higher capital sales volumes and better copper prices. Kidd Creek, Kidd had an operating loss of $21 million in the quarter, compared to a loss of $1 million last year. Mine operations performed better than anticipated. However, the results were negatively impacted primarily as a result of lower metal prices compared to last year. Looking at American Racing, our first quarter results from a cash operating perspective were breakeven compared to a loss of $10 million last year. OEM sales volumes continued to decline while aftermarket sales are seeing steadily increasing. The major reason for the improved performance was a reduction 3 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

APRIL 24, 2002 / 8:00PM, FAL_pa.TO^G08 - Q1 2002 NORANDA INC Earnings Conference Call in costs, which resulted from a number initiatives, which we have communicated to you before. In particular, the closure of the Warsaw facility, significant staff reductions and overhead reductions. Also, energy costs were lower this year compared to last year, at the first quarter last we did have a number of disruptions due the energy situation in California. If I could turn to our consolidated statement of cash flow, make a few comments there; our cash flow before working capital changes was significantly higher than last year, $209 million compared to $118 million. That's all due positive on the part of the negative side, our working capital, also increased significantly by approximately $168 million. Particularly relates to a number of different things, first Falcondo restarting operations so there's natural buildup of working capital. Second, with higher metal prices, particularly in nickel, it also increases the value of working capital. As Antamina continues to ramp up there's a buildup of working capital on that business. And, as well, in general, there is some seasonal buildup of inventories and working capital as we go into the December season for a certain of our businesses. Our capital investments, capital is $189 million in the quarter, which is significantly below last year's number of $313 million. Of that $189 million approximately 60 million related to maintenance and the balance through capital projects. Projects such as the Altonorte expansion, the Kidd mine and so on. A brief comment on our balance sheet, our debt levels increased in the quarter and our debt to capitalization ratio is now approximately 45 percent. With the proceeds we'll receive from the Noranda Income Fund of approximately $400 million, we'll receive on closing, which is scheduled for May 3. This will help us to meet our objective of not increasing our debt level in 2002 from our 2001 levels. Hopefully, we can exceed that objective and see a decline in our overall level of debt. That concludes my comments at this point. DEREK PANNELL This is Derek Pannell, I'd just like to add one or two detailed remarks, perhaps on the operations to elaborate on the points that Aaron has made. On the aluminum side, operating results here generally improving. On the quantum leap project, continual ramp there. We're starting to see sales beginning to pick up on -- that's on our aluminum foil area. And, also, American Racing the strategy to emphasize the aftermarket rather than the OEM side of the business is progressing well and, in fact, is giving us the improving results that Aaron mentioned there. On Antamina, we're presenting in the completion test phase that will take some time. It's over the 90 days, but that is underway at the present time. Last month we produced the first magnolia concentrate at Antamina. And, one thing that I think that's worth noting and it was a concern to some people outside. And, that was the ease of transfer between the different ore types Antamina being our other 50 complex ore body. Switching between ore types and getting them down the pipeline. In fact, our experience to date has been that these transfers between ore types can be accomplished quite efficiently. And, that's very good news there and gives us a fair amount of flexibility. At Altonorte, as Aaron said, we did start up the reactor. The startup was late by about a month and a half. We also started up the slag mill. We ran it first on slag that produced from the rebook furnace. It's now running well on slag produced from the reactor. The reactor is running well. With the existing acid bump we're getting good sulfa fixations, well over the 90 percent, and the remaining part of the project, the acid plant and the oxygen plant that are due to be completed in 2003, we certainly appear to be on time and on budget for the remainder of that expansion. In Collahausi, again, as Aaron said, good results there. And, we're moving from the Ohenato the Rosereo Pitwe will be and have led the first two contracts for the major equipment in order to accomplish that transfer. That's the crusher and the overland conveyer, which will allow us to operate the Rosereo Pit and that's still into the original mill. At Gaspe we also announced the permanent shutdown of the Gaspe operation, that's happening this week, at the end of April. And have already begun to divert concentrates -- the concentrates contracts that we are maintaining, they have already been diverted to the Horne or elsewhere. The magnesium Danville the ramp up continues very steadily there as we have replanned we're up about 20 cells. And, we're now; I think at a level an operating level that is quite substantial. So, that enables us in terms of gas velocity through ducts operating ease at a level, an operating level that makes it somewhat easier to troubleshoot some of the problems that we might have in the future. So, again, things at the Magnesium plant are ramping up quite well. 4 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

APRIL 24, 2002 / 8:00PM, FAL_pa.TO^G08 - Q1 2002 NORANDA INC Earnings Conference Call On the nickel side I think everybody has, perhaps, seen the release that we had on the results at Nickel Rim, I think were very positive, spectacular even. The Raglan mine continues to operate very well. We're at a million tons there. And, we have contract negotiations underway. We're not at the stage where we have a recommendation from the union to the members to accept a contract there. So, that is looking quite positive. And, that contract expires at the end of this month. But, every sign is that we should get acceptance by the members over the next three weeks of a renegotiated contract. As Aaron mentioned, also, we hit a shutdown of Falcondo operation in Dominican Republic for approximately three months. That started up during the quarter and during March was operating at full capacity. The startup went very well. Finally, on the integration of Noranda and Falconbridge, that has moving at pace. We have the structure decided upon and communicated to employees that we will be using in the Toronto office, particularly for the back office corporate support functions, and, also in the Santiago offices as we bring the two companies together. And, so that part of it is certainly moving well and also we're starting to see some other areas for collaboration between the two companies and one of those examples would be the acid that is produced by Altonorte and consumed by Lomas Bayas. Again, quite a substantial savings can be made there. I think that summarizes the comments that I have on the operations. DAVID KERR OK. And, I think that (indiscernible) comments. Operator, you said to get back to you when we were ready to take questions, and we are. THE OPERATION Caller Aaron, for a change we didn't have any unusual items in the quarter. That makes it clean. The second quarter, I note that the CEZinc deal is down, what would the number that you're going to reporting on the book for your adjustment as a usual item or if any? AARON REGENT From an earnings perspective, Terry? Caller Correct, from PLO'spoint of view. AARON REGENT One of the things we need to sort out is what the working capital balance is going to be. But, I think in the press release we highlighted in the neighborhood of $50 million of net, net gain, that's after taxes and provisions. Caller Okay, so the (indiscernible) is still to be working capital is still to be adjusted between the assets, right, between the entities? 5 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

APRIL 24, 2002 / 8:00PM, FAL_pa.TO^G08 - Q1 2002 NORANDA INC Earnings Conference Call AARON REGENT Yes, we've got a pretty idea of what it's going to be. We just need to sharpen the pencils to put a pen in it. But, in terms of earnings, the anticipated gain in the order of 50 million. And, that's after transaction costs, taxes, things like that. Caller Derek, could you please talk about the upcoming production in the quarter in terms of concentrate grades and the head grades and your outlook for the second quarter and also for the year, what the number is going to be EPF? What about antidotal evidence from different sources here, what are the numbers going to be in terms of concentrate and the concentrate grades? What were the numbers in the first quarter too? DEREK PANNELL Well, I'm not sure I've got the numbers in the first quarter. Just to talk, perhaps, first a little generally about Antamina. What has happened, in the mine, the open pit, it's quite -- still quite tight in there with the number of benches is quite limited. And, that's normal at the beginning of a mine, particularly with the topography that is present there. And, with the additional ore that was found, it was assumed before it was being waste, there was just much higher in zinc then it left us relatively little options other than to do what we did. So, that's the main reason behind that. I don't have the details for the prediction, but we're looking during the first quarter the average grade was 1.3 percent copper, 1.4 percent zinc, which is about 20 percent lower than what we had planned. And, I don't have the detailed tonnages that are expected for the rest of the year. There's no reason to expect that they would be for the remaining three quarters any different than what we had previously predicted. Caller So, you're not changing your forecast for the year, whatever they were, despite the first quarter of the grade adjustment? DEREK PANNELL No, I think we won't probably catch up on the first quarter, but the remaining three quarters would remain the same as predicted. Operator Caller Regarding Brasscanwhat is there current ownership of Noranda and is there any reason to expect that this will either shrink or grow and which? AARON REGENT Brasscan owns approximately 40 percent of Noranda right now and they have stated that they intend to continuing owning the shares of Brasscan. Caller Status quo, then? 6 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

APRIL 24, 2002 / 8:00PM, FAL_pa.TO^G08 - Q1 2002 NORANDA INC Earnings Conference Call AARON REGENT Owning their shares of Noranda, let's correct that one. Yes, that is our understanding. And, we've actually gone up and spoken with the CEO of Brasscan just on that subject just so that we'd be able to answer this question as we're doing right now. And, he said we intend to keep on owning of Noranda. Caller And, he didn't say we're going to buy as much as we can get, then? AARON REGENT He did not comment further. Operator Caller First, you made the comment regarding lower recycling feed through the period. I wonder if you could add some color to your outlook and expectations as to what sort of recycling feed volumes you hope to put through over the next few years, particularly in light of the joint venture. And, secondly, how much interest was capitalized during this quarter? DAVID KERR The recycle the recycle volumes, at the present time we don't have concrete plans for any changes as a result of the coming together of Falconbridge and Noranda, say the two smelters. And, what I have said is that I believe there are a lot of opportunities for that. What we are seeing is the startup of the Hewlett Packard Plant in Nashville, Tennessee and we'll get the plant improvements through that. And, again, the continuing exactly the same, I think, from Rhode Island Micro-metallic in San Jose and the Sacramento Plant. But, on the recycle side, again, once thing that has affected us has been the issue that we've had with Beryllium and that has restricted the amount of feed we've been particularly careful on that. But, that is a problem that we're working on with our suppliers. And, I would expect that feed to increase again. Caller Has the beryllium source feed been coming from a specific source and is the Hewlett Packard joint venture likely to exacerbate that? DAVID KERR No, the Hewlett Packard joint venture is generally has been -- in fact, as far as I know, has been completely free, although, we have checked it. The areas -- we do know it's certain shippers. It's not just one. It's several shippers. It depends on the different feeds that they ship. But, as we become educated about this issue, they too are becoming educated and understand what sorts of feeds are likely to contain levels of beryllium that we cannot accept. So, the market, as well as ourselves, are becoming much more aware of this issue. I think industry in general is becoming more aware of it. 7 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

APRIL 24, 2002 / 8:00PM, FAL_pa.TO^G08 - Q1 2002 NORANDA INC Earnings Conference Call AARON REGENT The amount of capitalized interest in the quarter was approximately $11 million. Operator Caller That does pretty lean, I'm surprised, but in any case, actually, I don't know how wants to tackle this question, but using the 15 percent, parameter, we get these questions a lot by the way, help me out, what price would you use for Noranda to get that 15 percent number for metal. AARON REGENT Is this your return on equity number, Terry? Caller Yes. Just give me a combination number that you guys are using internally for instance that you can achieve that 15 percent number given the asset base, the expanding asset base you have to make. AARON REGENT The 15 percent ROE is a target number for us. We would not say that with the current asset mix and base we have today that we could at long-term trend prices produce a 15 percent rate of return on equity over time. We still have pieces of the puzzle, which we need to fill in to get to that level. However, I will say, Terry, that with the asset base we have today, we're probably capable of long-term trend prices of more than doubling their returns on equity we've had over the past 10 or 15 years. Caller One of the dilemma's that I have, David and Aaron, is that, I mean that this is going back to the -- showing my age here, going back to the 70s, looking at the Noranda balance sheet begin because it has delivered and there's not question about that, you agree with that. And, now we are, you know, now paying approximate net interest cost of about $150 million, and that's almost like, you know, it's about 80 percent or 60 percent of your operating margins. So, that itself is a result of REO on the table. And I'm sure you're addressing it. I'm just wondering what else you're addressing on beyond the prices in terms of balance sheet issues? AARON REGENT We can't ignore prices if you're going to use it as a percentage of margin you're talking about there, because what you're doing is looking at margins that have metal prices that are inflation adjusted terms the lowest they've been in about 60 years. So, that's not really going to help us much with answering your questions. Caller Okay, but the low-term target of Noranda of a balance sheet target of about 20 to 25 percent hasn't changed, that you guys traditionally promoted as the long-term target for Noranda for--. 8 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

APRIL 24, 2002 / 8:00PM, FAL_pa.TO^G08 - Q1 2002 NORANDA INC Earnings Conference Call DAVID KERR We would still like to have debt somewhere between 25 and 35 percent of our total capitalization, yes, that's correct. And, there are times when we are above that and time when we are below and in both cases, we need to take appropriate action to the get back to the more modest levels, or the median levels I should say. AARON REGENT Terry, I also had a comment about our debt in the way we manage our liquidity. We've always had a policy to have a significant undrawn bank lines to support the ebbs and flows of the cash flows of the company. And we continue to do that. And have those available. Second, if you break down our debt, well over or close to half of it would be, really project debt or debt of Falconbridge. So, on a corporate level, our debt levels, I think it's important to sort of isolate or understand that that difference as well. Caller No question Falconbridge carries a lot of debt into the consolidation, no question about it. Okay, thanks Aaron, thanks, David. AARON REGENT Just a last comment, it is obviously above the thresholds that we are very cognizant and have as an objective a desire to reduce that significantly. Caller But, I mean, the question really is, do you want to use metal prices as your leverage to reduce that or do you want to do more asset oriented balance sheet deals, thereby can reduce it, or both? AARON REGENT I think we have to look at, look, I'm the finance guy, so it's my job to look at all those things. Operator Caller Derek, could you talk a little bit more about Magnolia production forecast for this year, and whether or not any of the planned production has been spoken for or sold, thank you? DEREK PANNELL We have Bob Sipplein the room here whose Senior Vice President for Magnesium; perhaps Bob can give you a fuller picture on Magnolia. Bob? BOB SIPPLE The production plan for this calendar year is 30,000 tons of products and at this time, roughly about 70 percent of that is firmly contracted. And, as we ramp up production during the year, the remaining tonnage will be sold on a spot basis. But, so far this year, we've had no difficulty in placing 9 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

We have excellent relationships formed with dye casters in the aluminum industry to place the tons. So, we're still pretty much on plan for the 30,000 tons for this year. Operator Caller Most of my questions have been answered, but one final one, Derek, as you look around the various divisions Noranda on a scale of say one to 10, how would you rate your level of satisfaction with the performance of these divisions? DEREK PANNELL Well, one's never satisfied, so I think this will -- I see a lot of very good people, but I see a lot of room for improvement and I see a lot of opportunities for growth. On a scale of one to five, I'm reluctant to put them on a scale. I think this whole variation. And, I think there are some very positive plants since I've come onboard, we've shut two of the plants down, so I put them on a scale of zero right now and I think the Kentucky Will Plant and the Gaspe smelter I think there are some that are really excellent, Lomas Bayas, which has done -- exceeded far beyond our expectations I would rate it 10, let's say five and that gives us a lot of scope for work. Caller And, you would say that was the same, what, across the divisions, or--? DEREK PANNELL No, I would say it was very varied across divisions and across assets. Operator Caller Just when you mentioned on magnolia that you're selling some of your magnesium spot, I mean, what type of pricing would you be realizing for spot magnesium in the markets, or are you still selling it, although you're selling it into the spot market, are you still selling at a significant premium? And, maybe, sort of when we're on the same topic, could you maybe just refresh my memory if you've capitalized anymore costs at magnolia what the current capitalized cost of that project is? BOB SIPPLE The terms of the prices that we're realizing within the magnesium industry, we tend now to disclose the prices because there's not a LME reference price, so it's very much a negotiate feature between the supplier and the consumer. But, a lot of this spot tonnage, the small amount that we haven't firmly contracted. We would certainly look to place it just with additional business with existing customers as they tend not to be fully contracted for their own requirements to leave some for spot. So, it would go, really, just with increased sales with our strategic accounts as the first choice and if necessary just sold spot to other customers during the course of the year. 10 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

AARON REGENT I'm sorry; I was about to answer that. On a 100 percent basis the project cost is probably just in excess of a billion dollars, which 80 percent is Noranda's.

CORPORATE PARTICIPANTS Howard Green Unilever - Head of Investor Relations James Edwardes - Jones CONFERENCE CALL PARTICIPANTS Graham John HSBC Andy Smith (ph) Julian Hardwick ABN Ambro Tim Potter Goldman Sachs Silvan Masso (ph) Morgan Stanle David Lanf (ph) Invest Tax Security Julia Bannon (ph) Arnold Langwa JP Morgan Robert Yanbas ING Bearing PRESENTATION Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations Ladies and gentlemen, good morning and welcome to this presentation of Unilever's the first quarter results. A transcript of this presentation can be accessed via our website. That transcript contains the usual formal disclaimer as to forward looking statements within the meaning of relevant US legislation, and this presentation and discussions are conducted subject to that disclaimer. I propose not to read the disclaimer, although we take it as read into the record for the purpose of this presentation and conference call. So now let me turn to our results for the first quarter, and I remind you that unless otherwise stated the financial numbers used in this presentation are in euros at constant rates of exchange, that is average 2001 rate. On chart one, you will see the key features of our results for the quarter. Firstly underlying sales growth was in line with our expectations of 1.8 percent. In the leading brands, sales growth was 4.6 percent of last 12 months with 3 percent in the quarter. We've seen good momentum through the quarter with underlying sales growth of the leading brands of over 6 percent in March. Secondly our operating margin before exceptional items and goodwill amortization moved ahead strongly by 250 basis points to 14.9 percent in the quarter. This progress is being driven by substantial increasing gross margins which are ahead by 160 basis points. Thirdly, net interest of 320 million euros is 26 percent below last year, reflecting the combination of lower (ph) rates, benefits the strong cash flow from operations, good management of capital employed and proceeds from our disposal program. As a result of the strong increase in operating profit and lower interest, earnings per share before exceptional items and goodwill amortization advanced by 37 percent in the quarter. Compared to pre-close, we saw stronger progress in gross margins. Expenditure on advertising and promotions and associated costs was also slightly low because of activities rephased in quarter two. This re-phasing contributed six percentage points to the EPS BEIA growth. The amount of advertising and promotions involved was 30 million Euros, equivalent to less than two percent was spent in the first quarter. Let me now put these results in the contexts of our operating plans of 2002. The value creation culture embedded in Unilever and shows that our focus is on growth which is profitable growth. The surest way of securing profitable growth is to work at getting the business fundamentals right. So, let me illustrate what this is meant for us as we implement our path to growth strategy and how it has influenced our quarter one results, the ninth quarter of our 20 quarter program. As we implement our strategy, different products of our business will have different priorities at any 2 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call for Europe particular moment. Those priorities are, however all consistent with the building blocks of our strategy and in combination, they will get us to our 2004 target. Let me turn to chart two and try and go behind the numbers to tell you what I mean through a few examples. Firstly, near 10 billion euro annual turnover skin, hair and deodorant mass (ph) market businesses grew by a little over 7 percent in the quarter, by over eight percent per annum over the last three years. With good growth and excellent operating margins, we certainly have a good example of sustained value creation. We've had a good start for the year and it is only the phasing of innovation for the slightly diluting out quarter one growth rate. Secondly, within our six billion euro plus annual turnover spread in cooking product business, our leading brands which account for over four billion euros of sales grew by more than three percent in the quarter. The emphasis is on proving that we can sustain growth on the back of our proven track record of generating attractive margins. The second part of our strategy is about finding value enhancing strategies to exit from our oils businesses. The sale of refineries in Europe and Mazola are good examples of what we are doing. The third example is our near seven billion euro annual turnover laundry business, which shows fast growth in the quarter with around a 350 basis point increase in operating margin. We have a regionally differentiated strategy. In Western Europe, we have regained share compared to a few years ago, and we have improved profitability by building on our market strength through innovation. Even in a very competitive market of quarter one of this year, we've seen two percent volume growth. In the US our strategy is to be a profitable number two and with a top comparison sales growth in the previous year, we have given up some share that significantly stepped up profitability. Watching the rest of the world where we lead the market, the emphasis is being on improving profitability as we continue to move share forward. Incidentally, our total laundry business has got on an average of four percent plus over the last three years and grew in mid single digits in March month as the emphasis on improving profitability, particularly in our rest of the world market turn back towards growth. I'll now turn to our near ten billion euro annual turnover savory and dressings business, which includes olive oil. Our leading brands are 90 percent of this, and we've seen underlying sales growth in them of around 1.5 percent. Here the emphasis is being on ensuring that we have created the firm foundation from the best foods integration, particularly with regard to brand understanding and sales force integration on which - on which the leverage, a regular flow of innovation. We have secured that sound foundation and again we've seen momentum through the quarter with underlying sales growth of approaching three percent in March. We have a strong innovation program scheduled for the rest of the year. It is here that we've, also the world class brands that provides, the vehicles for accelerating the growth of our foods business and developing an emerging market. These brands, plus our own parallel and experience, representing exiting growth from profit opportunity as we move forward with our plans. Now for tea based beverages, our 2.5 billion euro plus annual turnover business saw a smooth decline in sales, but this discarded two very different phases in the implementation of our strategy. On the one hand we saw a low double digit growth in Lipton Ready-to-Drink tea in both Europe and North America as we continue to expand our brand into the 350 billion euro soft drinks market. In North America, there has also been a particularly positive response for the March launch of Lipton Brisk Lemonade. On the other hand, in the leaf tea we see - we see two factors of faster growth and action which in this quarter produced an underlying sales decline of around 10 million euros. Firstly, we continue to see strong growth in Central and Eastern Europe, particularly in Russia, as we extend the reach of our leading brands. Secondly, however, this growth has been offset by deliberate reduction of unprofitable volume in our business in India as we continue to focus on improving margins which are ahead by some 320 basis points in the quarter in India. Lastly, ice cream and frozen foods businesses with annualized turn over of over 7.5 billion euros grew underlying sales by very close to four percent in the quarter, and also moved operating margins ahead by 270 basis points. In many ways, these businesses show the power of faster growth, cutting of tail brands, exiting from certain countries or finding different business models, a rapid implementation of restructuring initiatives and a focus on innovation, have all contributed to a rejuvenation of businesses where we have strong market positions. Again, we have to sustain this performance with all the building blocks in place to do just that. I hope these few examples give you a flavor of the different aspects of faster growth as it gets implemented in our business around the world. 3 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Earnings Conference Call for Europe Let me now turn to the overall sales growth for the quarter by focussing on the common themes within these strategies and there implications for our first quarter growth rate. These are showed on chart III, within the sales - within the three percent leading brands growth for the quarter, foods grew 2.6 percent and Home and Personal Care grew 3.5 percent. In March month, we saw leading brands growth of over 6 percent with both foods and HPC contributing strongly. In foods, the majority of the growth came from volume whereas in the Home and Personal Care, there was a high proportion of price. The greater contribution coming from price in the Home and Personal Care reflects the high proportion of business in developing and emerging markets which have experienced devaluations. This takes us through to our first common scene. In a number of developing and emerging markets, we're in the process of restoring margins which have been affected by the devaluation led cost increases. As is normal at this stage of the cycle, underlying sales growth slows. This happens because pricing action is offset by an increase in the rate of underlying volume decline as consumer markets shrink. Our focus is on maintaining the strength of our market position and coming out of the crisis stronger than when we went in. We know from experience that this trend starts to revert itself, we would expect to see this as we move through 2002. We also know our approach works for the long term health of the business. In 2001, the developing and emerging market sales were 34 percent of sales, up from 20 percent in 1991 and the growth rate before acquisitions in current euro is around 9 percent per annum. Operating profits has increased slightly above this rate. Our second common scene is that we've a very different phasing of innovation this year compared with last year, particularly in Asia-Pacific and North America. In 2001, as we said at the time, we had well over third of our big hit innovation in the market in the first quarter. Just to remind you, this included innovation in spreads and cooking products, the launch of N-joi (ph) in the UK, launch of the Ready-to-Drink tea partnership with Santori (ph) in Japan, the launch of laundry tablets, and innovation in Surf liquid in the US, the launch of easy to use wipes under the Lever 2000 and Dove brands in the US. The launch of Sunsilk branded as Sedal in Mexico. The different phasing of innovation in 2002 is simply that, phasing, not the lack of initiative and it is not that last year's initiatives have run out of steam, a number of factors have to be taken into account in the practical reality of an upgrading plan when it comes to the timing of innovation. This year, our program of market initiative is more backend loaded, but it is also as least as intensive as last year, with a sustained rate in home and personal care and a step-up in foods. The impact of margin recovery and innovation phasing on the growth of the leading brands is well in excess of our 150 basis points. In the to the business, we have a fast attrition in the non leading brands with the decline of around 4.3 percent in the quarter compared with the growth of 80 basis points in the first quarter of last year. We've always said harvesting of value from the non-leading brand part of our business will vary quarter by quarter, that's the most important issue for us just to make sure we extract the value and it is not to worry about consistency of sales delivery. I think we have shown that we're in control of this process and our margin progress and the momentum in our restructuring programs provides the supporting evidence. Tail attrition has impacted underlying sales growth by some 80 basis points. In respect to amend the tail of our business, we also see that the effect of disposals is to reduce sales growth by 300 basis points to give reported sales of 12.3 billion Euros, a decline of 1.3 percent from the prior year. Let me wrap up the section on the sales growth by reconfirming that we remain comfortable with where we are in terms of the business cycle in those markets where we have suffered economic dislocation, our innovation plans for 2002 are on track and we continue to manage the tail of our business to maximize value. We also remain confident of achieving our objective of sustaining the growth of our leading brands and that - and that these brands will represent approaching 90 percent of total sales by the end of 2002. Let me now turn to how we've continued to drive forward our operating margins, this is shown on chart four, the basis point quotes are all expressed as an effect on total Unilever operating margins. Gross margins moved ahead by 106 basis points in the quarter. The key drivers of the improvements in gross margins have been firstly continued benefits from our procurements and supply chain restructuring programs which contributed some 160 basis points of gross margin. Secondly, improved mix contributed some 60 basis points through disposals on a larger proportion of higher margin categories. 4 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Earnings Conference Call for Europe Thirdly, good progress with recovery of devaluation led cost increases through pricing actions. There is still a short fall between cost increases and price of around 60 basis points, a substantial improvement on the 130 basis points we saw in quarter four of last year. We increased investments behind our brands in the quarter not withstanding the relatively high spent, rate of spent in the first quarter of last year, while advertising promotion as a percentage of sales was 50 basis points below last year, this is more than offset by higher investment in trade and consumer price promotions which we call above the line expenditure of a 150 million euros. You remember that we deduct above the line expenditure in order to arrive at the reported sales. Continued savings from both low medium rates and media efficiency measures are also estimated to be worth some 50 basis points of sales in the quarter. In advertising and promotions, we saw a step-up during the quarter as we introduced innovations to the market. In March month, advertising and promotion as a potential to sales with 30 basis points ahead of last year, lower associated costs at 20 basis points for operating margin progression with an additional benefit of 20 basis points from lower overheads. Let me turn to chart five to highlight the other key financial indicators for the first quarter. Operating profits before exceptional items and goodwill amortization rises by 282 million euros or 18 percent EBITDA before exceptional items which is in current money is 2.1 billion euros in the quarter. Exceptional items for the quarter were a 197 million euros which includes 222 million euros of restructuring and 25 million euros profit on disposals. Associated costs include in operating profits BEIA, were 40 million euros in the quarter. Interests payable is 320 million Euros, 26 percent lower than last year with approximately half of the reduction coming from a lower debt level through cash flow from operations and disposal and the balance from lower rates. Cash flow from operating activity was 1.1 billion euros in the quarter and if we look at this on a moving annual total basis, it has gone up from 5.6 billion euros in quarter four of 1999 to 7.6 billion euros in this quarter. Net debt of the quarter end at current rates exchange was 23 billion euros compared with 27.8 billion euros a year ago. Net gearing is 72 percent. Profit before tax of 962 million euros is 62 percent above last year, reflecting the improved operating margin and a lower interest charge. Effective tax rates for the quarter was 44.9 percent reflecting the non-tax deductibility of Bestfood goodwill amortization. The underlying tax rates for normal trading operations and excluding the goodwill affect is 33.9 percent. Now let me turn to chart six which shows how our reporting currencies have developed in the quarter and shows the impact on EPS of current exchange rates. When expressing current rates of exchange EPS before exceptional items and goodwill amortization grew about 33 percent in the quarter. In the quarter, we saw a strengthening of the Pound Sterling against the euro by 2.8 percent and of the US Dollar against the euro by 4.8 percent compared with a year ago. The current exchange rate results also reflect a 50 percent devaluation of the Argentinean peso. Chart six shows the current exchange rates EPS and the EPS BEIA on the percentage change for the Euro, the Pound Sterling and the US Dollar. I'll now review the quarters results and performance by region beginning with Europe on chart seven. Sales growth was broad-based across categories and includes the continuing strong contribution from Central and Eastern Europe. Underlying sales growth was 2.4 percent with a hundred basis points coming from price. Key highlights in the development of our business have been in Western Europe, underlying sales growth of 5.2 percent in branded spreads and cooking products, driven by the sustained progress for our innovation. Good growth in Savoury and dressings of 3.6 percent fueled by continued strong growth in Amora, growth of over 4 percent in Knorr and a strong contribution from Hellmann's in the UK. In our Home and Personal care mass (ph) consumer businesses underlying sales were ahead by a little over 4 percent. We have seen good growth in skin, hair and deodorants with the key drivers being Dove, Rexona and Axe. Dove shampoo and conditioner is now available in over 10 markets and the initial purchase pattern is encouraging. In laundry, volume growth has been only partially offset by competitive pricing environment. In Central Eastern Europe, we have seen growth in low double digits driven by particularly strong growth in Russia in tea, savoury and dressings, skin and hair and in savoury and dressings and household care across the rest of the region. Operating margins are 190 basis points, ahead of last year, reflecting the benefits of supply chain restructuring and Bestfoods synergy. I'll now turn to North America on chart eight. Sales were 3.5 percent lower through the effect of disposals. Flat underlying sales reflect the tougher comparator through later phasing of innovation this year, the impact on turnover of increased commercial investment in foods and the one off effect on trade stocks of K-Mart store closures. In foods underlying sales grew two percent with good volume growth partly offset by negative pricing impacts of 30 basis points. ice cream continue to grow very strongly, our leading spreads brands also performed well. Ragu Express continues to make progress and Lipton Brisk Lemonade was launched successfully in March. 5 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call for Europe However, overall sales growth was held back by the impact on turnover of trade investments behind a Wish-Bone product launch, the migration of Five Brothers Bertolli and promotions behind the Hellmann's brand in response to competitive pricing. Harvesting of tale brands reduced the underlying sales growth by a 140 basis points. We've gained market shares in spreads including Skippy and spoonables with Hellmann's and in Wish-Bone salad dressings. Shares in pasta sauce and side dishes are marginally down due to the phasing of competitive initiatives relative to our own innovation plans. We have an active program to counter this, going forward. In home and personal care, underlying sales declined 2.5 percent with good growth in skin being offset by a number of factors. Firstly, our innovation program is phased late - to later in the year, while the first quarter of last year benefited strongly from launches under the Dove, Swan (ph) , Caress, and Wish (ph) of brands. The effect of this is some 300 basis points to sales growth. Secondly, in laundry, we are focusing on improving profitability and margins have moved strongly ahead. Some loss of share means that overall sales growth was pulled down by some 130 basis points. Innovations in laundry are backend loaded in 2002 compared to 2001. Finally, K-Mart's program of store closures produced a one-off reduction in trade stocks with an effect of some 150 basis points on home and personal care sales growth. Operating margins increased strongly by 390 basis points to 15 percent driven by supply chain savings and Bestfood synergy. Margins were also boosted by lower advertising and promotion as a result of the different phasing of innovation and lower media rates. Lower media rates contribute 40 basis points of this. I'll now turn to Africa, Middle East and Turkey on chart nine. Underlying sales growth of 5 percent is driven by price increases in particular to restore margins in a number of countries where there has been devaluation. This has enabled us to protect operative margin at 9 percent not withstanding tough economic conditions. South Africa performs strongly with good volume growth across dressings, spreads, tea and personal care. Sunsilk was successfully launched building on our experience from Latin America. In Turkey, we continued to see consumer down trading and declining markets reflecting a difficult economy, but market shares and key categories were at least maintained, we have seen underlying sales decline by 10 percent. However, we have also significantly improved profitability. Good sales growth in Egypt and Arabia was offset by difficult trading conditions in much of West and sub-Saharan Africa. I'll now turn to Asia-Pacific on chart 10. Underlying sales growth in Asia-Pacific moved ahead by 40 basis points with a rapid acceleration through the quarter. In South East Asia, we continued to see strong growth in Indonesia across foods, home care and personal care. However, this was partly offset by both the Philippines and Thailand due to tough competitors in the previous year from phasing of innovation. In Japan, we continued to see high single digit growth in home and personal care, driven by Dove following the launch of shampoo last year and Ponds. However, in foods, we see a decline in sales against the strong quarter in the previous year which included the initial sales associated with the launch of our Ready-to-Drink tea alliance with Santori (ph) . In India underlying sales in the quarter declined five percent. This reflects destocking of the trade as we introduced continuous replenishments to our distributors, the impact of the budget where duties had been reduced on skin and hair products, and we have given rebates to the trade for duties already paid, and the continued impact on sales in foods as we focused on improvement in profitability. Our innovation plans were also phased later in the year as we get our housekeeping out of the way. Taken together, sales reduced by 35 million euros which is the equivalence, nearly 200 basis points on the growth rate of the Asia Pacific region. However, these initiatives also have important benefits for our business going forward as we have structurally improved our capital efficiency, strengthened our margin structure and thus further enhance that competitiveness. In the second quarter, we expect to see good top line growth in the region as we build on the innovations launched in March. Further - launched further innovations in the quarter, all markets across the region, I see a pick up in demand in India as the benefits of lower prices in skin and hair seep through to consumers. Operating margins of 300 basis points ahead with a strong improvements in results in both China and India, and 60 basis points of lower advertising promotions, reflecting phasing of innovations, media efficiencies in almost equal proportions. I'll now turn to Latin America on chart 11, sales grew by 1.3 percent with underlying sales ahead by 3.5 percent. Pricing is still the main drivers, we recovered the evaluation led cost increases, harvesting of the tail refused underlying sales growth by 220 basis points. Mexico continues to show very good growth particularly in personal care through Sedal which has now reached the share of almost ten percent through Axe and Dove and in Savori (ph) through the successful launch of Knorr Sazonisimo last year. We also see good growth in Andina led by the launch of Sedal. In Brazil underlying sales moved ahead strongly, deodorants Rexona and Axe and hair through Sedal both grew at more than 20 percent.

Earnings Conference Call for Europe also performed well from Dorianna (ph) and Becel including Becel Proactive. And profitable volume entailed businesses has been shed as we managed them for value. The current situation in Argentina has severely reduced consumer demands, volumes have been affected as a result. However, our management has deep local experience, we are taking the appropriate actions to preserve the long term value of the business. Market shares are firm in declining markets. Our laundry market shares in Brazil, Argentina and Chile remain firm. Operating margins increased by 200 basis points for the benefits of our savings programs and pricing actions to recover devaluation driven cost increases. That completes my review of the regions and I'll now be happy to take your questions. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Operator Thank you Mr. Green, now we will poll for questions from analysts. If you have a question please press the number one on your telephone, if you are listening to the conference call on a speaker phone please use the handset while asking your question, should you wish to cancel your question please press the pound or hash button. Our first question is from Ms. Annie Bonow (ph) , of CFSD. Please ask your question at this time ma'am. Hello? We'll move on to our next questioner, will be Ms. Dominique Bassian (ph) of Banque NSMD, please ask your question at this time please. Unidentified Good morning. Move on please. Operator We will try with our next person. That would be Mr. Graham John of HSBC. Please ask your question . Graham John - HSBC Good morning, Howard I'm here. I've got a couple of quick admin questions before going to the main question. Can you confirm what the - I think it's in the three percent leading brand growth in Q1 and also can you confirm when you expect the to close. Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations we continue to expect to close in the second quarter and in the leading brands, pricing is just about two and a half percent Graham John - HSBC OK, thanks. In terms of your interest charge for the full year, clearly you got a substantial reduction in Q1, based on lowest debt levels and lower interest rates, actually if you're through 2002 you - so the cash generation you got certain level of cash coming in. Since, there is nothing implied, sort of you know if you're going to get to your 15 percent operating margin target for the year and you got such strong reduction in interest charge that you're being a bit conservative on your EPS outlook for 2002. 7 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

I mean, let's just try and look behind the progress of interest. Most of it is said in the speech. Compared to last year round about half of it comes from rates. If you got to look at the yield curve, which I guess is available to most of you, going out, then there is certainly an indication of an uptake in that, and within our outlook for EPS we have taken into account the general shape of the yield curve. We will see how life develops, but as you would have expected from us we have fully considered all the information and the inputs that is available to us. I mean the other part of the interest line is as you rightly say the benefits from disposal program and yet there are the benefits of those flows to come including Mazola when those transaction close. We have - we have also factored those in. I think in looking at overall EPS, you also got to remember that as we exit from those businesses, that there is a dilution effect on EPS. As we said with the outlook statements, that dilution on EPS (ph) BEIA is around 300 basis points, and we got 300 basis points, was based on an assumption of the closure date for and Mazola in particular and the known previous disposals and that timetable is now different to the assumption that went into the outlook. Graham John - HSBC OK thanks and then, I mean just very briefly Howard, can you give us more detail on what's going in Argentina than you - obviously noted in Latin America, volumes down 7.4 over Brazil seems to be stabilizing, Mexico still seems to be falling in all cylinders. What is the volume decline in Argentina at the moment and are you managing to get any price margins for that? Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations I mean - lets take the two separate issues, because you asked two questions. If they go - I think you're asking two questions. What's the condition effect and then specifically what is happening in Argentina. The issue first, the whole of Latin America was that - the Argentina was struggling with its economic conditions for a long time, and the rest of the regions effectively were taking actions to the mitigate what was going to happen in Argentina. And that's part of the reason, I guess why we actually saw such a record devaluation in Brazil during 2001. So it looks at the moment as if contagion will be limited. In respect of Argentina itself, then we have seen underlying volume declines of above 20 percent and we have successfully recovered part of that in pricing, not the full effect, you can imagine that the other consequence of that is that you actually more carefully managed some of the other variable parts of the equation in terms of what you are doing in the market place and other discretionary spent items and all of those things are being managed very effectively, I mean the chairman and the CFO of Argentina are both Argentineans, have both been in their jobs for over ten years and managing very confidently and strongly through the current situation. Graham John - HSBC OK thanks, Howard. Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations OK. Operator The next question will be from Mr. Andy Smith of Schroeder Mark Sullivan Forney (ph) , please ask your question at this time sir. 8 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Earnings Conference Call for Europe Andy Smith Good morning Howard. Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations Hi, Andy. Andy Smith I've got three questions, firstly can we comment on the phasing of your AMP (ph) spent during the balance of the year and are you sticking to your 15 percent AMP to sales target by 2005, that is the first question. Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations Right, the - let me deal with the AMP target, what we - what we said as fast growth was the investment in advertising and promotions would increase by an underlying 200 basis points, they happened to be 13 percent at the time and it was - that mathematically gave you 15 percent. We still expect that we will be spending that additional 200 basis points. There are of course changes that happen in portfolio, but anything that happened so far would not bring you to anything more than about 20 basis points on a good calculator difference of 15 percent. So yes, we are sticking with that as an integral part of the fast growth direction. In terms of the phasing and shaping of AMP as we move through the - through the year, then obviously that reflects the pace of marketing, marketplace activities and that is stepping up as we - as we move through the year. I am not going to give you a quarter by quarter phasing, but what I can tell you is that the step-up in marketing is consistent with our low double digits, EPS outlook and as I said in the speech in March month itself we actually moved ahead of the prior month by 30 basis points. Andy Smith Thanks, the second question is just a guidance from the chairman that 90 percent of group sales in leading brands by the year end implies rather disposals are likely. Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations As we've always said the management of the tail and extracting value from the tail comes about through two distinct processes within the business. We would by much prefer to achieve get disposals and get the process out of the way. I think it makes a cleaner for us and it certainly makes it cleaner for our investors and everybody else out there. So we will make sure that consistent that our value creation criteria that if disposal is the right way to go then that's the way that we will go. We will equal - equally ensure that the where disposal is not possible that we follow a harvest strategy, and a harvest strategy means that we will trade off volume for the price and reduction in support expenditure in order to, as the words says "harvest the cash from it" and that is why we said as interdentally as part of fast growth that actually looking at the overall top line number is nothing indicative of where we're actually going with the strategy because those declines as we harvest the tail, actually you know, sort of reduce the rate of underlying sales growth in the business. And in quarter one of this year, you've seen the impact of that because we had 4.3 percent reduction that was against the quarter where we had seen in fact an 80 basis points increase, not reduced the overall Unilever top line number. So it considers both of those parts and they - and we also remained confident by 2004 the leading brands will be at 95 percent, close to 95 percent with the business. 9 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Earnings Conference Call for Europe Andy Smith Just one final question, obviously your personal care business, hair, skin and deo, you know, it's continuing to perform reasonably well, but can you comment to that the performance in overall , both in the quarter and over the past 12 months or so? Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations I mean, just let me say, it's not often I get a chance to do the advertising, but I think skin, hair and deo is a 10 billion business growing at a rate - that it is grown consistency of rate is grown and with operating margins close to 20 percent is a little better than just performing okay. I think it's stellar example of value creation. So that's my advertising slot over and done with, and incidentally shows how you can grow and produce profits at the same time. In respect of overall, we actually have a very differentiated strategy by region. In respect of Europe, we have some significant areas of strength which we focus on, the - one of the issues as we look at the figures is that we actually in the prior year changed the distribution arrangements in key countries for part of the overall category, and so was showing (ph) an underlying sales decline in overall - in Europe. It is purely the effect of the change in the distribution strategy, because of stocking up with our new distributor in the prior year. So a focus strategy based on countries in Europe and one where we are growing share in those countries. In Latin America, we have a very powerful business in Chile, we have a strong number two position in Brazil focused around the Closeup brand, and we have also areas of strength in North Latin America particularly in Andina and Central America. If I move to North America, that is very clearly an area where we have taken the decision to make sure that we get the right balance between our market position and profitability, and we've been ensuring that that we enjoy exceptional value by taking profit out of that business. If I move to other parts of the world so Asia Pacific, then we have grown a significant number two position, in the overall category in India the market shares of nearly 40 percent. We have a fabulously strong position in Indonesia based around the Pepsodent brand and we have other pockets of strength, so the oral care category is very much one of a differentiated strategy according to region and even by country and one where we've gained enjoy exceptionally good operating margins. Andy Smith Thanks, Howard. Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations OK. Operator The next question will be from Mr. Julian Hardwick of ABN Ambro, please ask your question at this time sir. Julian Hardwick - ABN Ambro Hi, good morning to you. Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations . Julian Hardwick - ABN Ambro I reckon thinking that you had one fewer trading day in this quarter? 10 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call for Europe Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations Yeah, that's absolutely correct, but of course, we also had Easter. I mean, I've seen other people writing about trading days, I think, we have generally not talked about trading days, and it really affect the way that consumers consume our brands, so that - that in a mathematical sense yet there was one fewer trading day, but I think it is important that people realize that there was also Easter. Julian Hardwick - ABN Ambro Yeah, tell me. Would you think that they were pretty again each other then? Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations Yes, I mean, I would be, you know, happy with that as an assumption, I think that is a fairest presentation of what actually went on. Julian Hardwick - ABN Ambro And in both, the fewer trading day take place in 18th (ph) March? Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations Yeah, no, it in fact happened in January, yeah, just the way that the Unilever calendar were, I mean you got 13 weeks in the quarter, we work on the basis of a calendar that goes 5-4-4 and this year, the - well we balanced it out in the January month. Julian Hardwick - ABN Ambro OK. Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations And by the way, just so that you can look forward in that, in 2004 quarter 1 of 2004 there's going to six fewer - six more trading days in the first quarter of 2004, compared with the third quarter of 2003, just - then we might actually explain that as being something that, but one day, no, I don't think so. Julian Hardwick - ABN Ambro OK, and how much would the early Easter contributed to the strong growth we saw in March on sale line? Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations No, this is -this is related mainly to the phase of innovation, I mean, I've said a number well in excess of six, you know - you know, how we describe these things. It's primarily through the launch activity, I mean I just, you know, we have to take these things in balance, I think it's wrong to get, you know, through, totally focused on one quarter particularly in the case of Unilever when you got in through the implementations or strategies that we are going through just as in quarter four of this year will in fact get one extra day in the - in the calendar. If I have to estimate it, then the leading brands were growing as I said by well over six percent and it might be upto about one percent with my bringing back down to six percent, 11 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Earnings Conference Call for Europe the leading brands growth. I wouldn't change the six percent leading brands growth number in - what you are thinking about is just because of Easter. Julian Hardwick - ABN Ambro OK. Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations Add a six in front of it, that's what I am saying. Julian Hardwick - ABN Ambro OK that's nice, but I hear you, and could you also just talk about the strong increasing profits and the health and wellness in beverages business in this (ph) quarter. Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations Yeah, sure, I mean possibly it is - what we were talking about under the Asia - Asia Pacific region and that is the shedding of unprofitable tea business in India, you'll also know that, by the way the tea prices have been falling and that has reflected itself down into, that's a pass through for the consumer as well, which also impacts on the beverages sale - sales line as an aside. So the shedding of the unprofitable tea business in India, the lower commodity prices - lower - low tea commodity prices had a margin benefit in Europe, we've been able to retain part of that benefit and also in SlimFast which is - which is in that category, you see the benefits of scale (ph) and also some changes in sorting for the market extensions, marketplace role-out in Europe. We were bringing in products from the US and local European sourcing is in place, that is being done through a third party co-packing arrangements as we would call it, so it has also a good benefit in terms of the capital employed in the business. The other issues would all be common to the other general trends, but those are - those are three areas specific to help them well in this and beverages. Julian Hardwick - ABN Ambro OK, thanks so much. Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations Thanks. Operator The next question will be from Mr. Tim Potter of Goldman Sachs. Please ask your question at this time sir. Tim Potter - Goldman Sachs Good morning Howard. 12 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call for Europe Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations Hi, Tim. Tim Potter - Goldman Sachs You apparently gave us an indication of the sales trends in Central and Eastern Europe, could you give us an indication what happened in Western Europe please? Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations Finally I'll give it every quarter, certainly in Western Europe the - our lines of sales were ahead by two percent then with over three percent in the - what we'll call the Ambien (ph) foods round about two and a half percent, oh sorry that's including ice-cream and frozen foods by round about two and half percent and the difference you can find in home and home and personal care. Tim Potter - Goldman Sachs Thank you. A second question, if I may, can you give us indication of how long it may take the company to get their margin in the right sort of position in US laundry? Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations OK, let me just - let me just take a brief history talk, I mean in the early 1990's laundry margins in the US were in the very very low single digits. We went through a process of supply chain simplification, overhead reduction with the objective of getting the operating margins back into low double digits. This we had done as we left the 1990's. There was some slippage on that in 2001 including the investments in some marketplace activities, those margins fell back down into single digits. As we look at the operating margin now, we have got them back into the double digit territory, that's been a process that was ongoing through the second half of last year and into the first quarter of this year, that again has come from supply chain initiative. So the that's - and also being more selective about the specific segments of the market in which we're going to - going to operate. So we are comfortable with where the margins are in the first quarter where we got them to and as I said in the speech we have an innovation plan for the second half of the year moving forward, so you know, good job done so far, and it's creating the - has created the funds for us move forward. Tim Potter - Goldman Sachs Thank you, can you remind us how big that business is, by the way? Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations Well, the laundry business in, if I told you that the market share is just under 20 cents, I am sure that you got market values that would enable you to work it out. potter: OK, Howard, thank you. Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations Thank you. 13 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call for Europe Operator The next question will be from Mr. James Edwardes Jones of CSFB, please ask your question at this time sir. James Edwardes - - Jones Morning Howard. Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations (Inaudible). James Edwardes - - Jones Two questions if I may on chart four, excuse me, in your presentation, the first is the overhead savings of 20 basis points, looked to have reduced quite sharply from the second half of the last year, is that an indication that the cost saving program is starting to slow, may be the impact of low volume on your cost ratios, and the second question is, I think you've mentioned that in the leading brands, most of the growth in food was from volume and from HPC was in price, but on page four you've got very similar level pricing numbers of both HPC and foods, how do you reconcile those two? Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations OK, the - I mean the reference to the greater proportion from volumes was a specific comment to do with March month. The chart four result is the something - it's not something, the chart four is to do with the full quarter. And so that's the issue there. James Edwardes - - Jones . Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations In terms of the overhead issue, then one of the things that you get when you actually make a number of disposals is that you obviously get some uncovered overheads as you exit from those businesses, and those as part of the restructuring programs, take a little time to get out, and that is the - that is the main effect of the overhead rates. In terms of the savings programs, then everything remains on track and we are quite comfortable with where we are. There will also be some elements of what shall I call them variable pay type awards get accrued as we move through the first quarter. James Edwardes - - Jones Right. Thank you for that. Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations Thank you. 14 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call for Europe Operator The next question will be from Mr. Silvan Masso (ph) of Morgan Stanley, please ask your question at this time, sir. Silvan Masso - Morgan Stanle Good morning, Howard. Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations Good morning, Silvan (ph) Silvan Masso - Morgan Stanle You just said that the restructuring saving on , I mean and at the same time one of the surprise in the quarter compared with the trading statement is gross margin exemption, sir could you elaborate on that volumes in gross margin, and where is the price coming from, that's my first question. Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations I mean the, what we said in pre-close was that we expected gross margins then move ahead by in excess of a 100 basis points. We actually ended up at a 160 basis points and that really is a result of the good momentum that we have got in overall turns of margin - of margin, the coverage particularly in the evaluation current- devaluating currency. The other part of it is that we actually got a higher proportion of higher margin categories within the - within the overall sales made and that has had a leveraging up effect. So we just done better and structurally we are in a better position than we expect it to be and we have gained some degrees of freedom as we move forward. We think that we have created some headroom for ourselves. Silvan Masso - Morgan Stanle OK. And my second question is given that the advertising spending is again lower than expected, is that not an indication that the innovation is pushed back, sort of back on what you were expecting. Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations No. Let me just go through the various issues. First of all specifically in the March month which was when number of the innovations that we kicked through advertising promotions, this was up 30 basis point compared to the prior month. As you look at advertising promotions which was 50 basis points down. You should also bear in mind that we have still got media efficiency and media price benefits of 50 basis points. So in terms of the bang to your buck if you want to describe it then we are quite happy where we are and the third issue is that we have spent an additional 150 million euros in terms of what we call above the line expenditure which is deducted in terms of the reported sales number. So as we look at the total investment behind our brands that has increased in returns, admittedly parts of that has been money that has been dealt back to the trade to ensure that we can get at least price changes to actually stick. But, you know that's part of the - part of the process and part of the negotiation that goes on. We are happy with where we are as I said in terms of the overall economic cycle and we are also happy and can confirm that our innovation programs for 2002, our own track and that there is a step up in foods and the program in HPC is the least of intent as it was last year. 15 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Earnings Conference Call for Europe Silvan Masso - Morgan Stanle OK, could do you just tell us whether March last year, you said, I mean AMPs up on last year the few basis points in March, was not last year high or low months of AMP?. Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations It was a high month. Silvan Masso - Morgan Stanle Thank you. Operator The next question will be from Mr. Greene of the Capital Group. Please ask your question at this time, sir. We will continue with Mr. David Lang of the Invest Tax security (ph) . Please ask your question at this time sir. David Lanf - Invest Tax Security Good morning Howard. Can You hear me? Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations Yes, I can. David Lanf - Invest Tax Security I want to ask about the ice cream business, it had a pretty good quarter comparatively. Could do you just flush out what - what was behind the turn and you mentioned inventories, but could you talk about the European business and perhaps the European frozen food business and then moving on to the developing and emerging markets, what's been going on in Latin America particularly Brazil where I think weather has been pretty filthy in the early part of the year end, what's the performances been there and perhaps in some of the other developing the emerging markets where the companies has been loosing money? Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations We will come on to whether the company has been loosing money, David . David Lanf - Invest Tax Security Thank you. Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations Yeah, lets go on a quick tour as we quality of the ice cream was. One thing that I - I think is worthwhile saying is that we now got an ice cream business where it made a profit in the first quarter of the year. Now that might sound a bit strange, but actually in terms of history and other peoples 16 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call for Europe ice cream operations, the regular flow of profitability is sometimes a concern. We have clearly focussed on improving overall efficiency in the business, making sure that we have got a balance and very effective approach to the home marketplace. If I look in Europe, ice cream is ahead, oh sorry, a total ice cream let me start with. Ice cream is ahead in Unilever by seven percent in underlying sales growth in the first quarter. I think it is also quite dangerous at this time to actually draw any immediate conclusions on the prospects for Europe, given that yesterday it was glorious and today is not quite so bright at the moment. We have certainly made a good start for the European ice cream season and we have a number of important innovations that are going into the market and are being extensively rolled out. So we've also been gaining share in grocery. So overall in Europe, strong sales, yes it's being implored by good weather, but we were making a very good progress. In North America, we continue to perform extremely strongly. We've got underlying sales growth in low double digits, good grew very very well, Ben & Jerry also continued to grow well. In Brazil, your weather forecasting colleagues or weather observers in your extended network have given you the right information, the weather has been extremely difficult and we've had a difficult first two months in ice cream in Brazil, but it was pulled back in the March month, but we have certainly seen underlying sales decline in terms of the ice cream business. Just to - just to reassure you in terms your overall profitability in Brazil however, you know that we use EVA measures charge in the full amounts of the capital employed, and on the EVA calculation ice cream in Brazil is strongly positive. It's a - it's a positive number and it's positive against last years, the variance is positive. Mexico has performed extremely well. So overall in Brazil, in the ice-cream world, we've had a successful start of the year. Let's wait and see how it develops, we are confident about the innovation plans as we move into the European season and in the rest of the world we've got a power house in America in terms of of Ben and Jerry and we have taken actions in the rest of the world to focus on profitable opportunities, we have exited from some countries, we have entered into new business arrangements, new business models in order to make sure that we have got profitable roots forward and that is showing in the numbers. David Lanf - Invest Tax Security Thanks Howard, could you just tell us about the European frozen food?. Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations Yeah. David Lanf - Invest Tax Security Thanks. Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations European frozen food, we of course came up against, when I let out the list of innovations, we came up against the very strong comparator in the prior quarter from the launch not only of N-Joi (ph) , but I think it's went into other markets as well. We actually see underlying sales decline against that comparator, but that is - that is just that. It's up against a tougher comparator. In terms of the overall profitability of the business, we have again improved the profitability of our frozen foods business in Western Europe. We moved our trading margin ahead by over a hundred basis points, and we have got innovation programs in the higher value added, what I would call meal solutions and on trend foods later in the year. They will happen towards the second part of the year, but we again have got an exiting innovation program in that area. David Lanf - Invest Tax Security Thanks very much. 17 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call for Europe Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations OK. Operator The next question will be from Ms. Julia Bannon (ph) of . Please ask your question at this time ma'am. Julia Bannon Good morning Howard, it's Julia here. Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations Hi, Julia. Julia Bannon Hi. Howard, I've got three questions. The first one is concerning the restructuring and the phasing of it throughout 2002. If you could comment on that and whether your guidance for full year restructuring has changed at all? Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations Is it in terms of the savings or of the charge? Julia Bannon No, sorry I've the charge. Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations No, it hasn't. I mean the slight difference that there is between the charge in the quarter one in the preclosed guidance, is simply a couple of projects have fallen over into April month of - in accounting terms, that's when they actually get booked. I think the other thing is that I should actually clarify is that when we do the pre-close, I have been tending to give the, not tending I have been giving the gross restructuring number and because the profits on disposals and the closing of transactions is not strongly enough predictable or is not predictable enough to tool ways, we've to include that. So I have been tending to give the gross number. So the number that compared to the 350 that we've given is the 222 that I gave in this page. So no change on our expectations of spent and no change on the total amounts of benefit that comes from the restructuring items. Julia Bannon OK, fine, thank you for that Howard. The second point is actually on the comment you made about the progress of leading brands in the month of March, I think you said Howard that the sales were up there, sort of a six percent. Can you - would you be kind enough to split that up between volume and pricing and talk little bit about the launches that have taken place, I think you said that it was because of the pace of innovation that you have seen a very smart movement upwards in March. 18 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Earnings Conference Call for Europe Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations Yeah. I would be guessing if I gave a volume and the price for the - Julia Bannon Guesses are fine, Howard. Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations Now, the guess is - all the things that then get reported and then I get . I got people scurrying around here doing some calculations. So I will talk about innovation. Julia Bannon OK, fine. Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations The length of the talk about innovation would depend on how quickly to calculate. Let me you just talk about innovation as we - as we move through March, March quarter and March month in particular. I mean, just to say, first of all, that on the food side, we continued to see throughout the quarter, a strong performence from the previous innovations in Pro.Activ and Culinesse. The product, we have rolled out into Central and Eastern Europe, into Poland. I have just talked with David about the roll out of - in ice-cream, Cornetto Soft and the soft ice product. That obviously was a significant impact into March months particulars. There is another ice cream product called Solero Smoother which also has gone to market in March. The new varience on Iglo Pizza went to market, end of February, beginning of March and there are a number of innovations in Slim Fast. We have - we have extented into new powder in the US. We have launched Slim Fast suits in the Netherlands and earlier in the quarter, there was the full relaunch of Slim Fast in Germany. In terms of the rest of the foods, a type of Lipton Brisk Lemonade went to the market in the US, in the second quarter and also wish dressing of marinade. There are a large number of others that I could talk about but, that's give some sense of the momentum that we've got there. If I look at home and personal care, then the continued roll out of Dove has picked up momentum as we have -- as we have worked through the quarter and incidentaly, there is also under depends (ph) the national growth that we are getting in personal care in the Japan market, where our growth rate was in the very high single digits. That I might as well say 9 percent in the first quarter. The normal set of (ph) Dove range extentions rolling. There has been a launch on the Pond's range at the end of February ,running into March month under deodorants. In Prestige, there was a lauch of Wera Vang which I think might have been a February launch. That is - but there were in Europe of scrores of Wera Vang and then, a grouping of sedal and Sunsilk. If I was to have a guess at the price elements of the leading brands, then, I would think that on average, it would be in line with the 2.5 that I gave to Graham Jones . You know, I mean and that really does represents a best guess. In terms of the foods volume part of it, then, that will be higher than the HPC part of it. Julia Bannon Okay, thanks, Howard. And just to say that the perso. Aloe Vera that's being launched, is that - is the UK the first market for that? Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations Yes, as far as I know. 19 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call for Europe Julia Bannon All right. OK. And my third question, Horward, is on laundry. If you could flush out comparative pricing statement you were talking about and talk about if there is any particular country and on what shares they are doing in those market as well? Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations Probably and the most intensely competitive market, at the moment, our markets are in Europe. The competition is extremely active, in particular, in France, and both on pricing and in terms of the amount of promotional space that has been - has been booked by competition in the French market. The German market also continues to be extremely competitive, but we are under represented in laundry in the - in the German market. In terms of the - of the UK, then there is also a fair amount of battling going on. But I have to say, there is nothing beyond what we would normally - normally expect from good healtier - good healthy competition. There is nothing that stands out with the normal amounts of a towing (ph) and throwing. Julia Bannon And what's happening to market share? Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations Overall in market shares in total Europe, we have given up some share. I think that we are round about 20 basis points down on the market share in the - in the top performance categories within the things what we would call fine wash which is way of caring for delicates or colored items. Then, we have got a marginally increased market share and there is some trading at what I would call the bottom end of the market where all the branded manufacturers are loosing a bit of space to retails and brands, but that is because, innovations are not there in the market place and that is their fault. Julia Bannon Howard. Thank you very much indeed. Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations OK. Operator Our next question will be from Mr. Arnold Langwa (ph) of J.P.Morgan. Please ask your question at this time, sir. Arnold Langwa - JP Morgan Good Morning, Howard. Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations Good Morning, Arnold. 20 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call for Europe Arnold Langwa - JP Morgan Just in three questions. First of all, could you give us a Life's life sales growth in foods and personal care. I know you have just given us numbers already, then, it would be very useful? Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations The lifes life growth in personal care, let me see. Let me say, what is a folder or another sheet, it's five percent in total personal care. Arnold Langwa - JP Morgan OK. And in foods? Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations In total foods, it is just under two percent. Arnold Langwa - JP Morgan OK. Thank you. My second question is related to raw materials. You mentioned that key prices came down and had a positive impact. My question is really, did raw material price have a positive impact on your gross margin and if so, how much does that explain the 160 base point improvement we saw in your - the gross margin level? Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations I couldn't possibly rate that out for you. I think that the -- that the whole area is one way. You got to look at the total -- the total impacts of all the actions that are going on. I mean, for example, we have got edible oil prices that are going up, we have got tea prices that are going down, we have got some mineral oil prices which are up although, up and down all over the place and they are influenced by what I would call currency effect. The commodities overall for total Unilever are slightly up from last year. It's not as much it was in quarter four. The - let me give you some other flavor for it and that is that if you are operating in, let us call a representative developing and emerging market region, where you are subject to the devaluation. So let me take the whole of Latin America and weight the currencies by GDP. Then in fact, you need some thing like a 15 percent price increase to get your margins restored. At the moment, we got about 12.5 percent increase in Latin America, equivalent and so, the commodity elements on it's own is only one part of the mix that we are actually trying to -- trying to manage. So, I am not trying to be unhelpful, but that's what's - that's what's in the numbers. We are trying to manage commodities, exchange rates, competitive issues on pricing and a 160 basis points that represents the structural improvement in our profitability and the additional flexibility in degrees of freedom that we have given ourselves. Arnold Langwa - JP Morgan OK. And last, why is the AMT he mentions that you had an increased rent in consumer price promotions. How did you reconsize it with the fact that you have seen relatively low volume growth in Europe, I mean that would have expected to see more volume growth based on actually the impact of - the positive impact of trade and consumer price promotion increase? 21 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Earnings Conference Call for Europe Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations Well, there is a number of number of issues - number of issues again. I mean if I run through some of the - I mean you asked, in particular, the personal care numbers in total. I know why you asked for those numbers. Let me just say that in the fragrance area, for example, there is a heavy innovation program last year. Fragrance sales happened to be down about 15 million euros in Europe in the first quarter against last year, but purely to do with phasing of innovation. If I look at the overall category, then, the changes in the distribution arrangements of which I mentioned to Andy Smith, earlier, actually give a comparative 10 million euros reduction on on sales. So they are just a large number of issues that are -- that are going on in anyone quarter, that impact the number. Let me give you perhaps a good illustration of what I mean. If you pay listing fee for the launch of a new product. Those listing fees we deduct from sales. That eliminates the intial volume growth number in the -- in the calculation. So, as innovation goes in to the market place, listing fees get recorded as above the line expenditure and we get a small number recorded as sales in our results as we report them. So, in the overall balance of the business as we move through quarter one, is why I say that we have remained comfortable with where we are in terms of the innovation plans, at the way that we are spending the money, the health of the brands and that we will sustain the growth of the leading brands in line with our outlook statements which the Chairman made in February with the full years results. Arnold Langwa - JP Morgan OK. Thank you very much. Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations OK. Operator The next question will be from Mr Robert Yanbas of ING Bearing (ph) . Please ask your question at this time. Robert Yanbas - ING Bearing Yes, Hello, good morning. I have two related questions. You mentioned the six percent plus growth for leading brands in March. Can you - can you say whether this occured in particular region? You have already talked about categories but can you talk about regions or did it occur in all regions, is the first question. Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations One of the - of the strongest areas of growth were in Europe and that was broad based in terms of category and geography. In Asia Pacific, particularly in India and South East what we call South East Asia, that came through particularly strongly and in fact in Asia Pacific, growth was in high single digits in the March month. We also saw a good growth in North America and again, that came in both the areas of ice cream and in our personal care businesses and also positive growth in laundry. Robert Yanbas - ING Bearing OK. Thank you. The second question related to that is, to what extent do you think this could be a pre-loading effect in March in anticipation of a possible price increases in second quarter? 22 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Earnings Conference Call for Europe Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations We do not load. We - there of courses action that is taken by the trade that might be in anticipation of price increases. There certainly are some price increases that are going on inEurope, but there is nothing that's that would be a distortion on the underlying, you know, the performance of the business. We would certainly not enter into practices which distroted those. Robert Yanbas - ING Bearing OK. Thank you. Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations OK. Thank you. Operator This concludes the question and answer session. Once again, we will hand over to Mr. Green, for closing remarks. Howard Green - Unilever - Head of Investor Relations Let me say a few words in summary. We made a sound start to the year. Our operational plans are directing the improvement in profitability in key areas of our business such as laundry, tea and ice-cream. And there is a continued focus on extracting value from the tail of our business. In addition, we have taken pricing action in countries where they have been substantial devaluations. A continuing expansion in underlying operating margins reflect our determination to grow our business profitably. Operating margins moved ahead by 250 basis points in the quarter with the key driver being an improvement of a 160 basis points in gross margin. Margin gives us the space to step up planned investment for the remainder of the year and we have enforced our plan delivery of low double digit growth in EPSDIA for the year. Through the quarter, we have also seen an increase in sales momentum which is line with our target for the year of sustaining the growth of our leading brands. We are confident of delivering our innovation of market place activities for the year which support the stronger growth plan for the rest of the year. In foods, we have a step-up in market initiatives, while in home and personal care, we continue with the strong innovation program. Finally, as we extract barrier from the tale of our business, we forsee the leading brands approaching 90 percent of sales by the end of 2002, up from 84 percent today. That leaves me to say, thanks for your interest and for your questions. The IR team will of course be happy to take the course, should you have further questions. I think you know the number, thanks and good bye. Operator This conference has been recorded and will be available in one hour.

We will shortly hand you over to Mr. Green. Howard Green - Unilever - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations Ladies and gentlemen, good morning and welcome to this presentation of Unilever's first quarter results. A transcript of this presentation can be accessed via our website. That transcript contains the usual formal disclaimer as to forward-looking statements within the meaning of relevant US legislation and this presentation and discussions are conducted subject to that disclaimer. I propose not to read that disclaimer, but that we take it as read into the record for the purpose of this presentation and conference call. So now let me turn to our results for the first quarter. I remind you that, unless otherwise stated, the financial numbers used in this presentation are in Euros at constant rates exchange, that is average 2001 rates. On chart one, you will see the key features of our results for the quarter. Firstly, underlying sales growth was in line with our expectations at 1.8 percent. In the leading brands, sales growth was 4.6 percent over the last twelve months with 3 percent in the quarter. We have seen good momentum through the quarter with underlying sales growth of the leading brands of over 6 percent in March. Secondly, our operation margins, before exceptional items and goodwill amortization, moved ahead strongly by 250 basis points to 14.9 percent in the quarter. This progress has been driven by substantial increase in gross margins, which are ahead by 160 basis points. Thirdly, net interest of 320 million Euros is 26 percent below last year reflecting the combination of lower rates and the benefits of strong cash flow from operations, good management of capital employed, and proceeds from our disposal program. As a result of the strong increase in operating profit and low interest, earnings per share the before exceptional items and goodwill amortization accounts a 37 percent in the quarter. Compared to pre-close, we saw stronger progress in gross margins. Expenditure on advertising promotions and associated costs was slightly low because activities rephased into quarter two. This rephasing contributed six percentage points to the EPSBEIA growth. The amounts of advertising and promotions involved was 30 million Euros, equivalent to less than 2 percent spend in the first quarter. Let me now put these results in the context of our operating plan (ph) in 2002. The value creation culture embedded in Unilever ensures our focus is on growth, which is profitable growth. The surest way of securing profitable growth is to work at getting the business fundamentals right. So let me illustrate what this has meant for us as we implement our path-to-growth (ph) strategy and how it has influenced our quarter 2 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Earnings Conference Call for the US one results, the ninth quarter of our twenty quarter program. As we implement our strategy, different parts of our business will have different priorities at any particular moment. Those priorities are, however, all consistent with the building blocks of our strategy, and in combination, they will get us to our 2004 targets. Let me to turn to chart 2 and try and go behind the numbers to show you what I mean through a few examples. Firstly, our near 10 billion year annual turnover skin, hair, and deodorant mass market businesses grew by a little over 7 percent in the quarter and have grown by over 8 percent per annum over the last three years. With good growth and operating margins, we certainly have a good example of sustaining value creation (ph) . We had a good start for the year, and it is only the phasing of innovation that is slightly diluting our quarter one growth rate. Secondly, within our 6 billion Euro plus annual turnover spreads and cooking products business, our leading brands, which account for over 4 billion Euros of sales, grew by more than 3 percent in the quarter. The emphasis is on proving that we can sustain growth on the back of our proven track record of generating attractive margins. The second part of our strategy is about finding value enhancing strategies to exit from our oils business. The sale of refineries in Europe and Mazola are good examples of what we are doing. My third example is our near 7 billion Euros annual turnover laundry business, which saw flat growth in the quarter, but around a 350 basis points increase in operating margins. We have a regionally differentiated strategy, and thus in Europe, we have regained share compared to a few years ago and we have improved profitability by building on our market strengths and through innovations. Even in a very competitive market of quarter one of this year, we have seen 2 percent volume growth. In the US, our strategy is to be a profitable number two and with a tough comparator on sales growth in the previous year, we have given up some share, but significantly stepped up profitability whilst in the rest of the world, where we lead the market, the emphasis has been on improving profitability as we continue to move share forward. Incidentally, our total laundry business has grown on average 4 percent per annum over the last three years and grew in mid single digits in March month as the emphasis is on improving profitability, particularly in our rest of the world markets, turned back towards growth. I now turn to our near 10 billion Euros annual turnovers savory and dressings business, which includes olive oil. Our leading brands are 90 percent of this and we have seen underlying sales growth of around 1.5 percent. Here the emphasis has been on showing that we have created a firm foundation from the Best Foods integration, particularly with regard to brand understanding and sales growth integration on which to leverage a regular flow of innovation. We have secured that foundation and again we will see momentum through the quarter with underlying sales growth of approaching 3 percent in March. We have a strong innovation program scheduled through the rest of the year. It is here that we also have the world-class brands that provide the vehicles for accelerating the growth of our foods businesses in developing and emerging markets. These brands, plus our unparalleled reach and experience, represents an exciting growth and profit opportunity as we move forward with our plans. Now to tea-based beverages: a 2.5 billion Euros plus annual turnover business saw a small decline in sales. This is described as two very different phases in the implementation of our strategy. On the one hand, we saw a low double-digit growth in Lipton ready-to-drink tea in both Europe and North America, as we continue to expand the brand into the 350 billion Euros soft drink market. In North America, there has also been a particularly positive response to the March launch of our Lipton Brisk Lemonade. On the other hand in leaf tea, we see two facets of path-to-growth (ph) in action, which in this quarter produced an underlying sales decline of around 10 million Euros. Firstly, we continued to see strong growth in Central and Eastern Europe, particularly in Russia, as we extended reach of our leading brands. Secondly, however, this growth has been offset by deliberate reduction of unprofitable volume in our business in India, as we continue to focus on improving margins, which are ahead by some 320 basis points in the quarter in India. Lastly, ice cream and frozen foods. Businesses with annualized turnover of over 7.5 billion Euros, grew underlying sales by very close to 4 percent in the quarter and also moved operating margins ahead by 270 basis points. In many ways, these businesses showed the power of path-to-growth (ph) , cutting the tail brands, exiting from certain countries, or finding different business models, a rapid implementation of restructuring initiatives and a focus on innovation have all contributed to rejuvenation of businesses where we have strong market positions. Again, we have to sustain this performance, but the building blocks are in place to do just that. I hope these three examples give you a flavor of the different aspects of path-to-growth (ph) as it gets implemented in our businesses around the world. Let me turn to the overall sales growth for the quarter by focussing on the common themes within these strategies and their implications for our first quarter growth rate. These are shown on chart three. Within the 3 percent leading brands growth for the quarter, foods grew 2.6 percent and 3 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Earnings Conference Call for the US home and personal care grew 3.5 percent. In March month, we saw leading brands growth of over 6 percent with both foods and home and personal care contributing strongly. In food, the majority of the growth came from volume (ph) , whereas in home and personal care there was a higher proportion of price. The greater contribution coming from price in home and personal care reflects the higher proportion of business in developing and emerging markets, which have experienced devaluations. This takes us to our first common theme. In a number of developing and emerging markets, we're in the process of restoring margins, which have been affected by the valuation led cost increases. That is normal at this stage of the cycle. Underlying sales growth slows. This happens because pricing action is offset by an increase in the rate of underlying volume declines as consumer markets shrink. Our focus is on maintaining the strength of our market position and coming out of the crisis stronger than when we went in. We know from experience that this trend starts to reverse itself, and we would expect to see this as we move through 2002. We also now are for the long-term health of the business. In 2001, developing and emerging market sales were 34 percent of sales, up from 20 percent in 1991, and the growth rate before acquisitions in current Euros is around 9 percent per annum. Operating profit has increased slightly above this rate. Our second common theme is that we have very different phasing of innovation this year compared with last year, particularly in Asia Pacific and North America. In 2001, as we said at the time, we're just over a third of our big innovation in the market in the first quarter. Just to remind you this included innovation in spreads and cooking products, the launch of Enjoy (ph) in the UK, the launch of the ready-to-drink tea partnership with Sum Toi (ph) in Japan, the launch of laundry tablets and innovation in Surf liquid in the United States, the launch of easy-to-use wipes on the Lever 2000 and Dove brands in the United States and the launch of Sun Silk (ph) branded as Cidal (ph) in Mexico. The different phasing of innovation is simply that - phasing. Not a lack of initiatives, but is not that last year's initiatives have run out of steam. Any number of factors have to be taken into account in the practical reality of an operating plan when it comes to the timing of innovation. This year, our program of market initiatives is more back-end loaded, but it is also at least as intensive as last year with a sustained rate in home and personal care and a step-up in foods. The impact of margin recovery and innovation phasing and the growth of the leading brands is well in excess of 150 basis points. In the balance of the business, we have a faster rate of attrition in the non-leading brands with a decline of around 4.3 percent in the quarter compared with a growth of 80 basis points in the first quarter of last year. We have always said that the harvesting of value from the non-leading brand part of our business could (ph) vary quarter by quarter, but the most important issue for us is to make sure we extract the value and it is not to worry about consistency of sales delivery. I think we have shown that we are in control of this process and our margin progress and the momentum in our restructuring programs provide the supporting evidence. attrition has impacted underlying sales growth by some 80 basis points. In respect of managing the of our business, we also see that the effects of disposals is to reduce sales growth by 300 basis points to give the sales of 12.3 billion Euros, a decline of 1.3 percent on the prior year. Let me wrap up this section on sales by reconfirming that we remain confident with where we are in terms of the business cycle and those markets which have suffered economic dislocation. Our innovation plans for 2002 are on track and we continue to manage the tail of our business to maximize value. We also remain confident of achieving our objectives of sustaining the growth of our leading brands and that these brands will represent approaching 90 percent of total sales by the end of 2002. Let me now turn to how we can continue to drive forward our operating margin. This is shown on chart four. The basis point are all expressed as an effect on total Unilever operating margin. Gross margins moved ahead by 160 basis points in the quarter. The key drivers of the improvements in gross margins have been, firstly, continued benefits for our procurements and supply chain restructuring programs, which contributed some 160 basis points of gross margins. Secondly, improved mix contributed some 60 basis points to disposals in a larger proportion of higher margin categories. Thirdly, good progress with recovery of valuation led cost increases through pricing action. There's still a shortfall between cost increases and price of around 60 basis points. This is, however, a substantial improvement on the 130 basis points we saw in quarter four of last year. We increased investment behind our brands in the quarter, notwithstanding the relatively high rate of spend in the first quarter of last year. While advertising and promotion was up (ph) , essentially the sales were 50 basis points low last year, it was more than offset by higher investment in trade and consumer price promotions, which we call above the line expenditure, of 150 million Euros. You will remember that we deduct the above the line expenditure in order to arrive at reported sales. Continued savings from both lower media rates and media efficiency measures are also estimated to be worth some 50 basis points of sales in the quarter. In advertising and promotion, we saw step-up during the quarter as we introduced innovations for the markets. 4 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Earnings Conference Call for the US In the March month, advertising and promotions as a percentage of sales was 30 basis points ahead of last year, lower associated costs at 20 basis points of the operating margin progression with an additional benefit of 20 basis points from lower overheads. Let me turn to chart five to highlight the other key financial indicators for the first quarter. Operating profit before exceptional items and goodwill amortization rises by 282 million Euros or 18 percent. EBITDA before exceptional items, which is in current money, is 2.1 billion Euros in the quarter. Exceptional items for the quarter were 197 million Euros, which includes 222 million Euros of restructuring and 25 million Euros profit on disposals. Associated costs included in the operating profit DEIA (ph) were 40 million Euros in the quarter. Interest payable is 320 million Euros, 26 percent lower than last year, with approximately half of the reduction coming from a lower debt level through cash flow from operations and disposals and a balance from lower rates. Cash flow from operating activities was 1.1 billion Euros in the quarter and if we look at it on the moving annual total basis it has gone from 5.6 billion Euros in quarter four of 1999 to 7.6 billion Euros in this quarter. Net debt at quarter end at current rate of exchange was 23 billion Euros, compared to 27.8 billion Euros a year ago. Net is 72 percent. Profit before tax at 962 million Euros is 62 percent above last year, reflecting the improved operating margin and the low interest charge. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 44.9 percent, reflecting the non-tax deductibility of Best Foods goodwill amortization. The underlying tax rate for normal trading operations, and excluding the goodwill effects, is 33.9 percent. Now let me turn to chart six, which shows how our reporting currencies have developed in the quarter and shows the impact of EPS on current exchange rates. When expressed in current rates of exchange, EPS before exceptional items and goodwill amortization grew about 33 percent in the quarter. In the quarter, we saw a strengthening of the pound sterling against the Euro by 2.8 percent and of the US dollar against the Euro by 4.8 percent compared with a year ago. The current exchange rate results ought to reflect a 50 percent deviation of the Argentinian peso. Chart six shows the current exchange rate, EPS, and the EPSBEIA a percentage change of Euro, pounds sterling, and US dollar. I will now review the and performance by region, beginning with Europe on chart seven. Sales growth was broad-based across categories and includes a continuing spend (ph) contribution in Central and Eastern Europe. Underlying sales growth was 2.4 percent with 100 basis points from price. Key highlights in the development of our business have been in Western Europe. Underlying sales growth of 5.2 percent in branded spreads and cooking products driven by the sustained progress of our innovations. Good growth in savory and dressings of 3.6 percent fueled by continued spend (ph) growth in Amore (ph) , growth of over 4 percent in Knorr, and a strong contribution from Hellman's in the United Kingdom. In our home and personal care mass consumer businesses, underlying sales were ahead by a little over 4 percent. We have seen good growth in skin, hair, and deodorants, the key drivers being Dove, Rexona (ph) and Ax (ph) . Dove shampoo and conditioner is now available in ten markets and the initial purchase patent is encouraging. In laundry, volume growth has been only partially offset by competitive pricing environments. In Central and Eastern Europe, we have seen growth in low double digits driven by a particularly strong growth in Russia in tea, savory and dressings, skin and hair, and in savory and dressings and household care across the rest of the regions. Operating margins are 190 basis points ahead of last year, reflecting the benefits of supply chain restructuring and Best Foods synergy. I now turn to North America on chart eight. Sales were 3.5 percent lower through the effects of disposals. Flat underlying sales reflect a tougher comparator through later phasing of innovation this year. The impact on turnover increased promotional investment in foods and the one-off effect on trade stocks of K-Mart store closures. In foods, underlying sales grew 2 percent with good volume growth partly offset by negative pricing impacts of 30 basis points. Slim Fast and ice cream continued to grow very strongly and our leading spreads brands also performed well. Ragout Express continues to make progress and Lipton Brisk Lemonade was launched successfully in March. However, overall sales growth was held back by the impact from turnover of trade investments behind a Wishbone product launch, the migration of Five Brothers to Bertolli, and promotions behind the Hellman's brand in response to contested pricing. Harvesting of toll (ph) brands reduced the underlying sales growth in foods by 140 basis points. We have gained market share in spreads, including Skippy, inscrutables (ph) with Hellman's, and in Wishbone salad dressings. Shares in pasta sauce and side dishes are marginally down of competitive initiatives relative to our own innovation plans. We have an active program to counter this going forward. In home and personal care, underlying sales declined 2.5 percent with good growth in skin being offset by a number of factors. Firstly, our innovation program is phased for later in the year, while our first quarter of last year benefitted strongly from launches under the Dove, Suave, Caress, and Wisk (ph) bands. The effect is some 300 basis points to sales growth. Secondly, in laundry we're focusing on improving profitability and margins have moved ahead strongly. Some loss of share means the overall sales boat (ph) was pulled down by some 130 basis points. Innovations in laundry are back-end loaded in 2002 compared to 2001. Finally, K-Mart's program of store closures produced a one-off reduction in trade stocks with an effect of some 150 basis points on home and personal care underlying sales growth. Operating margins increased strongly by 390 basis points for 15 percent, driven by supply chain savings 5 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call for the US and (ph) Best Foods synergy. Margins were also boosted by lower advertising and promotion as a result of the different phasing of innovation and lower media rates. Lower media rates contribute 40 basis points of this. I know turn to Africa, Middle East, and Turkey on chart nine. Underlying sales growth of 5 percent is driven by price increases, in particular to restore margins in a number of countries where there has been devaluation. This has enabled us to protect operating margin at 9 percent, notwithstanding tough economic conditions. South Africa performed strongly with good holding (ph) growth across dressings, spreads, tea, and personal care. Sun Silk (ph) was successfully launched on our experience from Latin America. In Turkey, we continued to see consumer down-trading and declining markets, reflecting a difficult economy. Whilst market shares in key categories were at least maintained, we have seen underlying sales decline by 10 percent. However, we have also significantly improved profitability. Good sales growth in Egypt and Arabia was offset by difficult trading conditions in much of West and sub-Saharan Africa. I now turn to Asia Pacific on chart ten. Underlying sales growth in Asia Pacific moved ahead by 40 basis points with a rapid acceleration through the quarter. In Southeast Asia, we continue to see strong growth in Indonesia across foods, home care, and personal care. However, this was partly offset by both the Philippines and Thailand due to tough comparators in the previous year from phasing of innovations. In Japan, we continue to see high single digit growth in home and personal care, driven by Dove, following the launch of shampoo last year and also Pond's. However, in foods we see a decline in sales against a strong quarter in the previous year. This included the initial sales associated with the launch of our ready-to-drink tea alliance with Santori (ph) . In India, underlying sales in the quarter declined 5 percent.This reflects the stocking of the trade as we introduced continuous replenishment to our distributors, the impact of the budget where duties have been reduced from skin and hair products, and we have given rebates to the trades (ph) and duties already paid, and the continued impact on sales and foods as we focus on improvement in profitability. Our innovation plans are also phased (ph) late in the year as we get our housekeeping out of the way. Taken together, sales reduced by 35 million Euros, which is the equivalent of nearly 200 basis points on the growth rate of the Asia Pacific region. However, these initiatives also have important benefits for our business going forward, as we have structurally improved our capital efficiency, strengthened our margin structure, and thus far further enhanced our competitiveness. In the second quarter, we expect to see good top-line growth in the region as we build on the innovations launched in March. Launched (ph) further innovations in the quarter in all markets across the region and see a pickup in demand in India as the benefit of lower prices in skin and hair feed (ph) through to consumers. Operating margins of 300 basis points ahead with a startup improvement of results in both China and India and 60 basis points and lower advertising and promotions, reflecting phasing of innovation and media efficiencies in almost equal proportion. I now turn to Latin America on chart eleven. Sales grew by 1.3 percent with underlying sales ahead by 3.5 percent. Pricing is still the main driver as we recovery devaluation -led cost increases. Harvesting of the tail reduced underlying sales growth by 220 basis points. Mexico continues to show very good growth, particularly in personal care through Cidal (ph) , which has now reached a share of almost 10 percent. and Dove and a savory following the successful launch of last year. We also see good growth in Andina (ph) , led by the launch of Cidal (ph) . From Brazil, underlying sales moved ahead strongly. Deodorants, through Rexona (ph) and Ax (ph) , and hair through Cidal (ph) , both grew at more than 20 percent. Spreads also performed well from Voliana (ph) and Baycell (ph) , including Baycell Proactive (ph) . volume internal (ph) businesses has been shed as we've managed them for value. The current situation in Argentina has severely reduced consumer demands and volumes have been affected as a result. However, our management has deep local experience and are taking the appropriate actions to preserve the long-term value of the business. Market shares are firm in declining markets. Our laundry market shares in Brazil, Argentina, and Chile remain firm. Operating margins increased by 200 basis points through benefits and savings programs, pricing action to recover devaluation-driven cost increases. That completes my review of the regions and I will now be happy to take your questions. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Operator Thank you, Mr. Green. We will now poll for questions from analysts.

Earnings Conference Call for the US simply press the pound or hash button. Our first question will be from Mr. John McMillan (ph) of Prudential. Please ask your question at this time, sir. John McMillan - Prudential Hi Howard. Howard Green - Unilever - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations Hi, John. John McMillan - Prudential Your marketing initiatives are more back-end loaded and I guess I've heard that about six or seven times over the last week from other companies that delivered first quarter sales or March quarter sales or the like (ph) , whether it's, you know, domestic companies like Kraft and Hershey or Unilever, Nestle, DeNone (ph) . I mean, everyone seems to be a little bit light. Now, I understand your Latin American issues, which are somewhat unique and certainly would explain some of the shortfalls short-term and clearly have to get better from this juncture. But, I guess to the extent everyone's marketing initiatives are more back-end loaded, conceptually shouldn't that cause competition to increase? Howard Green - Unilever - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations Well, let me just try and, you know, sort of paint a picture of... John McMillan - Prudential How you see it? Howard Green - Unilever - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations No, of one of the specific reasons for us actually developing a plan that had this skew in it. Two of the most important reasons for the skew in the plan was that we wanted to make sure that before we launched initiatives in our foods businesses that we had actually got a stable base through the integration of Best Foods. There would be nothing worse for brand equities than trying to push through innovation into the marketplace onto sales forces that might, at the time we were doing the plans, have been at the stage of still going through that integration process. We've made good progress with that integration. We, in fact, ran slightly ahead of it and in terms of the providing that robust pace (ph) . I mean, March you already started to see the pickup in the performance of the business and we have a very energetic program going forward. Now, in terms of how that interfaces in the competitive space, we believe that we have also done the research and the homework that shows that those innovations are relevant to consumers and are appealing to consumers in the competitive environment. To me it sounds like all good news for consumers and we are confident about those innovations getting away and achieving our plans. The second key thing that I would pick out is that whereas Latin America is one specific area for us in terms of the economic environment, there are a number of other markets where we have been going through either devaluation type issues or where we have been deliberately taking structural changes in the approach to the business to improve the robustness on which we actually build going forward. In the devaluation type countries, or where we've been putting price increases through, then we also know from experience that to try and launch innovation at time that you're trying to get pricing in, is actually a tricky task and a lot of time of the sales force is actually spent in just making sure that we make the list prices stick and we are able to do that by making sure that, you know, it might involve some dealing back, some price increases, just to make sure that pricing does stick. 7 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Earnings Conference Call for the US The other type of example within the general economy that I would point to you is the example of India that I gave in the speech, which has not been subject to a devaluation, but where we've actually taken quite clear actions to structurally improve some aspects of the business. We've accepted that there'd be a 5 percent sales decline in that market so that we actually get the infrastructure so that we actually improve capital efficiency. It was also very important to us that we actually made sure that overall for Unilever our margin structures were where we wanted them. The margin structures, in fact, have moved ahead better than we had anticipated and therefore we actually think that we've created some headroom for ourselves as we move into the second quarter and through the rest of the year to really get behind our launches. So, it's a somewhat long answer. John McMillan - Prudential But, you don't see increased category competition on the horizon? Howard Green - Unilever - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations I think a lot of what we've actually seen, John, over a number of years is people increasingly focussing on their niches and their areas within categories. Yes, there will be competition, but we believe competition is good and that competition actually drives more efficient businesses and the more powerful your brands, which is the focus of path-to-growth (ph) , will be competition influenced for the more powerful brands and it's the brands five through seven are the ones that will feel the squeeze. John McMillan - Prudential And, General Mills will tell you that integration isn't all that easy, so you certainly had to go through some issues yourself. Can I just kind of focus a little bit just on North America, you know, where sales trends were, you know, flat. Howard Green - Unilever - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations You mean by the changing of the packaging size? John McMillan - Prudential Well, the tricky (ph) price increase, I guess. Is that what . Howard Green - Unilever - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations Yeah, no, we haven't. John McMillan - Prudential Do you plan to or you don't want to get into that? Howard Green - Unilever - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations I wouldn't get into that just to say that our ice cream business grew 15 percent in the first quarter, John. 8 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Earnings Conference Call for the US John McMillan - Prudential Well, it was pretty warm over here. Howard Green - Unilever - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations Yeah, I heard that you had 90º or something. We've had a good start to summer over here, as well. John McMillan - Prudential And, just the other food businesses. I'm trying to build models going back, but I thought I had somewhat used your comparisons. Maybe I was kind of hoping for more than two, but in terms of, I guess the warm weather also hurts your tea business or your - so there are some issues that benefit and hurt you. But, just in terms of little more color to the overall food business. Is that basically what you're targeting in North America? Howard Green - Unilever - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations Again, just for the sake of clarity, we did have a light program of marketplace activities in the first quarter because we really wanted to make sure that we actually had that sound foundation going forward. In terms of the individual market areas, our spread brands did perform well and that includes Skippy and we actually gained market share, both in spreads and the category. We responded to some fairly aggressive pricing activity in the spoonables area. The volume of business actually stayed well, but we actually saw price promotions of around about 8 percent quarter-on-quarter, which obviously impacts the top line. But in overall share terms, Hellman's has put on a full share point, despite that aggressive competitor activity. Equally, Wishbone, both in the business and in the new initiatives that we've got in the liquid dressings area, new products and also part of a health promotion, we've seen some share gain there. The pasta sauces, that is where there's been a different timing of innovation. Competitors have got innovation in the marketplace. Ours are phased later. We have certainly given some share up in pasta sauces, 50 or 60 basis points. However, in what I would call the special , almost type area, Ragout Express, we've actually gotten very, very strong there - strong growth. The other area that I should comment on is in tea where we've been changing over delivery of Lipton Brisk to the international yellow flagship color. We have seen some fall in sales there just as we actually adjust trade inventories and make sure that we've got the yellow color out along with our painting the walls yellow. So, our foods business overall is looking pretty healthy as we go into quarter two and also given the phasing of innovations as we move forward. Innovations already announced for quarter two in the US, for example, Hellman's flavored mayonnaise, Lipton Asian side dishes. Across this side of the pond, just to , we've also got , which I'm told is the UK's biggest initiative ever under the hot noodles brand (ph) . John McMillan - Prudential I think you guys have all the fun. Howard Green - Unilever - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations So, I mean we're actually excited about the program as we forward. Yes, sure, we've got to make it work, but we've got the innovations. We've got the, importantly, the increased investments to go behind those brands and we think that we will, as planned, see an uptick in growth as we move through the year. John McMillan - Prudential Thanks for all of that, Howard. 9 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call for the US Howard Green - Unilever - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations OK, John. Thanks. Operator The next question will be from Mr. Neil Goldner (ph) of State Street Global Advisors. Please ask your question at this time, sir. Neil Goldner - State Street Global Advisors Hi Howard. I've got a question about your A & P spending, a two-part question, I guess. First thing is, on the tail brands, is there any A & P being spent on the tail brands at all? And, if so, as you harvest the tail brands, what happens to that A & P spending? the bottom line, or is it reallocated to the leading brands? Howard Green - Unilever - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations Ninety-six percent of A & P is going behind the leading brands, so there's 4 percent of A & P going behind the tail brands. Of course, they're still what we would call just above the line expenditure that enables us to actually maintain distribution, to maintain price relatives (ph) on shelves as we extract the value from the tail brands. The assumption in path-to-growth (ph) was that as we got out to the tail, the A & P that was behind the tail would indeed be shifted across behind the leading brands and that is part of the movement of why we actually see 96 percent of it being behind those leading brands. Neil Goldner - State Street Global Advisors I just want to make sure - the 96 percent of the A & P was... Howard Green - Unilever - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations Yes, behind the leading brands. Neil Goldner - State Street Global Advisors OK, now is that just the A & P that goes through SG & A, I guess, or are you including... Howard Green - Unilever - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations Yes, that is just the A & P that goes into what you guys would call SG & A. Neil Goldner - State Street Global Advisors OK. So, the part that's being netted against the sales that we don't see as a separate line item, I guess the same question with that, as you harvest that business, eventually you're going to decide it's nothing worth harvesting anymore, the commercial spending going behind those brands, those also are expected to be shifted to the leading brands? 10 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Earnings Conference Call for the US Howard Green - Unilever - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations Well, I think the most - we would certainly make a judgment as to what is the appropriate level of so-called above the line expenditure that is needed to get the growth that we want. If that meant putting above the line money behind the leading brands, then that would be an operational decision that is made. In terms of the overall shape of path-to-growth (ph) , we were actually looking to increase the proportion of A within A & P because we expect to have more powerful innovation for that innovation to be focussed behind fewer and more powerful brands and for us to be building brand equity through that. I think in terms of the overall direction, that is the message that I'd like to leave you with. Neil Goldner - State Street Global Advisors Great. If I can just ask - two quick questions. Just (a) are the price increases in there as well? Are they sticking? And then the second question, of the 3 percent leading brands growth, how much of that came from acquisitions in the last twelve months? Howard Green - Unilever - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations OK. In terms of the leading brand growth, there is no acquisition effect in there any more. We've anniversaried the acquisition of Best Foods, therefore that's an organic leading brand growth number. Neil Goldner - State Street Global Advisors OK, so Slim Fast and Ben and Jerry's just aren't big enough to matter? Howard Green - Unilever - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations They're all big enough to matter. I think the issue is more of the one to do with phasing of innovation, the effects of the devaluation, driven effect on underlying sales growth. Those are a lot bigger issues in the total rate (ph) of Unilever, so Slim Fast and Ben and Jerry have performed extremely well. But, the others just happen to outweigh and I wouldn't want to take anything away from either of those businesses, which have continued their strong progress within the Unilever portfolio. In terms of the Brazilian price issue, then, yes. We've - our pricing is sticking and we are seeing the benefits of that in improved operating margins. Neil Goldner - State Street Global Advisors Great. Thank you. Howard Green - Unilever - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations Thanks, Neil (ph) . Operator Our next question will be from Ms. Ann (ph) Gillon (ph) of Lehmandlers (ph) . Please ask your question at this time, ma'am. Ann Gillon - Lehmandlers Hello, Howard. 11 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call for the US Howard Green - Unilever - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations Hi, Ann. Ann Gillon - Lehmandlers Just a question. If you could update us on Unilever's efforts to accelerate its new product launches across geographies in not so much the work of the innovation (ph) centers to develop the products, but more the ability to transfer from manufacturing sites across geographies. Howard Green - Unilever - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations Yeah, I mean, let me give two different examples. Let me take Slim Fast as a first example. We've started redeveloping the European market based on US-sourced production and we have then entered into a co-packing arrangement, as we would call it, a third-party manufacturing arrangement. The market positions got established and that is the way that we have moved with speed to grow the Slim Fast proposition in European markets. I think the other example I would give is in the personal care area where there (ph) is a to the innovation center network. It's easier to leverage innovation globally because at the global category board (ph) the ownership is established and the basic rules of harmonization that are essential for speed of and speed of layout (ph) are determined by that category board. So, something like Dove shampoo, for example, which was trialed (ph) out in Asia Pacific, we'd move rapidly into ten countries, as I said in the speech. And another example is the way that we actually moved our Sun Silk (ph) experience into the Mexican market by being able to work within geography so that to grab 10 percent share there and then across regions into South Africa where we actually launched there for black or colored hair. Those are sort of two or three examples of where grand focus, the focus on harmonization, actually allows you to properly leverage your scale. Ann Gillon - Lehmandlers OK, with Slim Fast you gave the example of being able to co-pack locally. Can you comment on whether or not you're able to move manufacturing as quickly to take advantage of local cost structures or whether part of your speed to broad geography rollout has meant that you're shipping more from the place the innovation was first launched. Howard Green - Unilever - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations No. I mean, for example, we've got a very active what we would call sourcing center based in India, which takes some of the more complex issues, perhaps some of the smaller things that you actually want to start out in small market tests, and is able to actually develop markets in that way. I mean, of the business we tend not to be particularly capital intensive. Our fixed assets or the percentage of sales are now down to around about 20 percent of sales. The intensive things tend to be things like laundry detergent blowing towers and things like that where there's certainly some more work to be done in overall sourcing arrangements and that's part of what's responsible for the improvement in the laundry margins that I talked about - about more regional approaches to sourcing. In some areas, such as deodorants, sourcing opportunities where we're just going to take it from one center because the value equation works that you use a sourcing center in country "A" to supply the world. Ann Gillon - Lehmandlers OK, thanks. That was helpful. And, then, separately - in your comments about the US you talked about innovations in laundry being back-end loaded this year. Can you share anything that already may have been announced, or are you still in the pre-announcement stage for these innovations? 12 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Earnings Conference Call for the US Howard Green - Unilever - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations We're very much in the pre-announcement stage and I think my old colleague Charlie (ph) Strauss (ph) would take me out and shoot me if he heard me say anything. Unidentified Well, we wouldn't want that, would be Howard? Howard Green - Unilever - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations Well, certainly not. Nor (ph) my family would want that. Ann Gillon - Lehmandlers Thanks much. Operator The next question will be from Ms. Florence Taj (ph) of Massachusetts Financial Services. Please ask your question at this time, ma'am. Florence Taj - Massachusetts Financial Services Hi, Howard. It's Florence Taj (ph) . I have some questions on the restructuring program. I was wondering if you could give the details of the savings you achieved this quarter and break it down between procurement, path-to-growth (ph) and the Best Foods . And, secondly, I have a follow-up question on North America. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the performance of the Best Foods brands. I know last year the performance there was a little bit disappointing. What are the trends like this year in the old Best Foods business? Are you seeing an acceleration? Howard Green - Unilever - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations OK. If I start with the restructuring and the savings. path-to-growth (ph) restructuring savings achieved in the quarter where 85 million Euros. Procurement savings were a little over 140 million Euros and the Best Foods synergy, as we call it, was just a little over 70 million Euros. Florence Taj - Massachusetts Financial Services OK. Howard Green - Unilever - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations The additional number of factories that we closed in the quarter is two, so all together now we have closed sixty-one factories and the head count reduction in the quarter was a little over 2,000 and for the total program so far we have got a head count reduction of a little over 25,000 people. If I turn to the Best Foods question, let's say just remember that in 2001 we focussed on integration of the business and sharing (ph) . We had a good understanding of the brands and have integrated (ph) the sales forces to provide the platform for growth driven by the innovation. 13 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Earnings Conference Call for the US As we actually look into the actual progress within the various markets, in North America, as I've just said to John McMillan (ph) , that Hellman's spoonables, whilst it did look good in underlying sales growth terms because of the price competition in the market, we've actually gained a share point for spoonables. In Skippy, we've also seen good growth and share rose by, again, over a share point. And , which is a relatively smaller brand in the US, the shares are stable. In Europe, we have gains a tick up in shares. Sometimes I don't believe that people can actually measure it to within 10 basis points, but that's what the market share basis says. We are flat in hot sauces and we're mildly down in wet and dry soups, which again is a relatively small part of our business, the wet soups. The dry soups is obviously a bit larger. But, again that's 20 or 30 basis points down. In the dressings category, we've actually gained share gain up by 20 or 30 basis points. In Latin America, in we've grown shares strongly in Mexico and in Brazil and what we call River Plate, which is Argentina and Uruguay, our shares remain exceptionally strong at around 60 percent in Brazil and over 80 percent in River Plate. Equally in mayonnaise, we're still very strong in Brazil with a share of 80 percent and over 70 percent again in River Plate. We've also gained share in Mexico. The plan - I should also mention food service. I shouldn't let our food service slip by. The progress in food service is - I'll break it down by geography. We've seen strong growth in developing an emerging markets. The only spot which is significantly down, in fact, from last year is Argentina and I'm sure you can understand that. And we've maintained that momentum in and D & E (ph) markets like China, Indonesia, Mexico. And in our Asia, I don't like particularly doing this, but let me exclude Argentina. If I go across Asia, Latin America, Africa, Middle East, and Turkey, food service showed high single-digit growth in food service. In Europe, we saw strong growth in many countries where we have fully completed the integration. So double-digit growth in Italy, the Netherlands, and all of the Nordic countries, in Portugal. However, where we have not yet finished the integration, which is in the UK and France, we continue to see a flat sales performance. There is a particular issue to do with the German market where there seems to have been some issues with - it's actually with our customers that tried to take some advantage of the change over of the Euro at the beginning of the year - particularly in what we'd call the hotel and restaurant area and that's had a knock (ph) on consumer demand, but I think that, from what I read, that's common to any food service providers in that market. In the US, again, it's a story of two halves, as we would say in a football game. Our sort of what I would call the branded side of the business has grown quite strongly, whereas our food solution section, so-called IFX (ph) , that business, as I've said before, has remained weak because of one particular issue or an issue at one particular customer. There's a number of innovations in food service that we've got going forward. You might have seen the soup bar (ph) concept. That will be rolled out in geography outside of its home base. We've got initiatives with Knorr frozen foods. There's a particular initiative in Austria; we're seeing how that goes. You might have seen Lipton Fresh Brew (ph) iced tea in food service outlets in the US. There's what we call Mexi-casa (ph) in Canada and a variety of sources and other initiatives in Thailand. So, Best Foods' plans are really all coming together and it's being programmed as we move forward through the rest of the year, but I think we'll start to see the kind of growth levels that we would expect from that kind of brand portfolio. Florence Taj - Massachusetts Financial Services OK. I have one further question on laundry . It seems that your seeing weakness in both US and North America. Can you elaborate a little bit on the competitive activity and who is being most aggressive, least aggressive, and whether you intend to follow? Howard Green - Unilever - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations Competitors who are being aggressive. I'm not going to name any of them. I don't think that does us any good. I think, again, there are two very different types of involvement. In North America, our ambition is to be a profitable number two and to make sure that we get the right balance between the growth part of the profit part of the equation. And over a second half of the year and this first quarter of this year, our American management in the home and personal care business have done an excellent job of raising profitability. That does mean that they have given up (ph) around about 40 basis points of market share. But by creating the profits, which, just so you understand, is well into low double-digits, they're also creating their own headroom for the innovations that they have got scheduled for later in the year. But, our objective is very, very clearly to be a profitable number two to make sure that we get that balance right. 14 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Earnings Conference Call for the US In Europe, again, the market - I think it's - I'd best describe it as, it's as competitive as it's always been. This is a very competitive market that we operate in. There's nothing different about it now compared to periods that I can remember in the past and, you know, there's just a lot of to-ing and fro-ing in terms of the balance. The competitors are making a strong run in France at the moment. There's quite a lot of price competition in the UK market. However, our position actually remains very strong in that market. So, if I look across the whole of Europe, then again we see an increase in profitability and 2 percent volume growth in a market that is only growing at that sort of rate, but some negative pricing. Negative pricing, I would guess, of around about 100 basis points. So, again, nothing material in overall share terms and the market just continues to be as competitive as it ever has been. Florence Taj - Massachusetts Financial Services OK. Thank you so much. Howard Green - Unilever - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations Thanks, Florence. Operator The next question will be from Mr. Andrew Wood of Sanford Bernstein (ph) . Please ask your question at this time, sir. This concludes the question and answer session. Once again, we will hand over to Mr. Green for closing remarks. Howard Green - Unilever - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations Let me say a few words in summary. We have made a sound start for the year. Our operational plans are addressing the improvement in profitability in key parts of our business, such as laundry, tea, and ice cream, and there's a continued focus on extracting value from the tail of our business. In addition, we are taking pricing action in countries where there has been substantial devaluations. A continuing expansion in underlying operating margin affect our determination to grow our business profitably. Operating margins moved ahead by 250 basis points in the quarter with a key driver being an improvement of 160 basis points in gross margins. Margin gives us the space to step-up planned investment for the remainder of the year and reinforce our planned delivery of low double-digit growth and EPSBEIA for the year. Through the quarter, we've also seen an increase in sales momentum, which is in line with our target for the year of sustaining the growth of our leading brands. We are confident that delivering our innovation and marketplace activities for the year which support the strong (ph) growth plan for the rest of the year. In foods we have a step-up in market initiatives, while in home and personal care we continue with a strong innovation program. Finally, as we extract value from the tail of our business, we the leading brands approaching 90 percent of sales by the end of 2002, up from 84 percent today. That leaves me to say thanks for your interest and questions. The IR team will, of course, be happy to take your calls if you have further questions. I think you know the number. Thanks and goodbye.

Denny Couture Noranda Inc. - VP Communications Derek Pannell Noranda Inc. - President and CEO Aaron Regent Noranda Inc. - President and CEO, Falconbridge Lars-Eric Johansson Noranda Inc. - Executive VP and CFO CONFERENCE CALL PARTICIPANTS Analyst PRESENTATION Moderator - Noranda Inc. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Noranda/Falconbridge joint conference call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question and answer session. At that time, if you have a question, please press the 1, followed by the 4, on your telephone. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Tuesday, May 28th, 2002. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Denny [Couture], vice president, communications. Please, go ahead, sir Denny Couture - Noranda Inc. - VP Communications Thank you very much, operator, and thank you all for participating in this joint conference call. Since the people involved in the announcement are the same at both companies, we thought it would be preferable for this time only to hold just one call. We have with us today Derek Pannell, who is our new president and CEO at Noranda, Aaron Regent, the new president and CEO at Falconbridge, and Lars-Eric Johansson, Noranda's new executive vice president and chief financial officer. They will start by saying a few words and we will follow afterwards with your questions. Derek? Derek Pannell - Noranda Inc. - President and CEO Thank you, Denny. I don't expect that this call will be very long. We really wanted to provide you with the opportunity to ask questions, if there are any questions. I want to start by saying a few words, and then I'm going to pass it over to Aaron and then to Lars-Eric. David Kerr is not with us this afternoon. He's actually, I think, on a well-deserved vacation. His decision to reduce his involvement at Noranda was one of the important triggers in the changes that were announced yesterday. He will now be executive chairman at Noranda, stepping down from the position of CEO that he held for many years. In those new duties, David will be mostly involved at the strategic level and, importantly for us, will remain a key player in building relationships that he's developed over the years with industry and with governments. 2 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

MAY 28, 2002 / 8:00PM, FAL_pa.TO^G08 - NORANDA INC Management Changes Conference Call For my part, after having done two jobs for more than three months, I must say that I'm not entirely unhappy with the turn of events. I'm very proud to have been selected by the Noranda board for this important job of chief executive officer of Noranda. As I couldn't hold both CEO jobs, the board decided to appoint Aaron Regent to the position of CEO of Falconbridge. Aaron is well known to many of you as a dynamic and creative senior executive. He has now been given another opportunity to use his impressive talents. I will be working closely with Aaron in my new role as deputy chairman of the Falconbridge board, as well as with Alex Balogh, who is another veteran of the mining industry who will be available to help both of us. Aaron's departure to join Falconbridge has opened up the CFO position at Noranda, and there was no hesitation on our part to offer that to Lars-Eric Johansson. Lars-Eric is very well known in the industry and has been playing - been playing that role, in fact, effectively at Falconbridge for some time, and we look forward to him making the same kind of leading contribution in a larger setting. I've had the pleasure of working closely with Lars-Eric during the last few months, and it will be a real pleasure to continue working with him in our new capacities. That sums it up for me. I'm going to pass it over to Aaron just to say a few words. Aaron? Aaron Regent - Noranda Inc. - President and CEO, Falconbridge Thank you, Derek. I am - I'm looking forward to this new challenge here at Falconbridge. I have been closely involved with Falconbridge for a number of years, and I have always been impressed by the quality of the people within the company, and I'm looking forward to working more directly with them. We have a strong team. A few comments I would like to make. I don't anticipate any major changes in the strategic direction of the company. We will continue to focus on the growth in the nickel business and there's a lot of potential on this front. We will also continue to maximize returns from all of our assets. For example, we are actively working with Noranda to maximize the performance of each of our [coffer] assets for the benefit of our respective shareholders and in Falconbridge's case, particularly at [Cape] Creek and within our South American businesses. I also want to assure you that I am committed to increasing the share price of Falconbridge. While it has been suggested in the past that this may not be in Noranda's interest, to the contrary, it is in their interest since Noranda would be the biggest beneficiary as the largest shareholder of the company. I was going to limit my comments to this today, but I look forward to reporting to you as the year progresses. I'll turn it over to Lars-Eric. Thank you, Aaron. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you, Derek, for your kind words. This is a little embarrassing for a Scandinavian like me to be described like that. I must say that I'm extremely pleased to be given this opportunity to join Noranda and face a new challenge. Not that I didn't have any. I have spent many years as a CFO of Falconbridge and it will be interesting for me to redefine my role and learn about Noranda's other businesses. I'm especially glad to have an opportunity to continue to be working with Derek. I think that we understand each other's vision and that we can easily work side by side. 3 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

MAY 28, 2002 / 8:00PM, FAL_pa.TO^G08 - NORANDA INC Management Changes Conference Call The challenges over at Noranda are clear. We will continue to focus on improved profitability and to strengthen our balance sheet. That's really nothing new to me, since I've been doing it for the last 12 years at Falconbridge and before that in several other companies. As the release indicated, I will continue to act as the CFO of Falconbridge until my replacement is identified, and I look forward to continuing to work with Aaron in his new role at Falconbridge. I got to know Aaron in the mid '90s, and over the years we have worked together from time to time on various transactions. So Aaron is familiar with Falconbridge and the challenges ahead. Thank you, and over to you, Derek. Derek Pannell - Noranda Inc. - President and CEO Thank you, Lars-Eric. And I'd like now to open the lines to questions from callers. Operator, if you could begin the question period, please. Thank you. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Moderator - Noranda Inc. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to register a question, please press the 1, followed by the 4, on your telephone. You will hear a three-tone prompt to acknowledge your request. If your question has been answered and you would like to withdraw your registration, please press the 1, followed by the 3. If you are using a speakerphone, please lift your handset before entering your request. Once again, if you'd like to register a question, press 14 on your telephone. One moment, please. Our first question is from Terrance [Orchland] with TSO Associates. Please proceed with your question. Analyst Thanks for the conference call, guys, and good luck to all of you in your new challenges. I guess my only question is: With respect to each of your new mandates or extended mandates, could we have some sort of a time frame whereby you expect to achieve or look at certain things and come back and report back to us? Obviously, you're familiar with all the companies and activities. We all know that. And we've got a lot of confidence in you in being able to direct the companies in the right direction. But like in every new administration that comes in, doesn't matter which political power in the White House or whatever, they have new visions and new expectations and maybe each one of you want to go through exactly what you want to see and the time frame that you can let us know. Thanks. Derek Pannell - Noranda Inc. - President and CEO Here, maybe I can kick off, Terrance. I think the first thing that we talked about was bringing the Falconbridge and Noranda back offices and so on together. In fact, we have a structure in place and are already beginning that. That would actually take place physically within the next six months. By the end of this year, we would hope to have the people physically relocated. 4 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

MAY 28, 2002 / 8:00PM, FAL_pa.TO^G08 - NORANDA INC Management Changes Conference Call And the similar would be true, perhaps a little ahead of that time, for our Santiago offices. We are already seeing that cooperation, in fact, particularly between [Alto Norte] and [Lumas Bias] on the asset. So I think that is going to take another 4 to 6 months to really start seeing it bedded down. But that's the time frame that I see there. With a lot of the other ones, I think the 15% ROE, that's our main target and that's what we clearly are being - are focusing on at both companies. And that, to a large extent, in Noranda and I guess elsewhere within industry, depends on the economic recovery and where we see that happening. Now, there has been perhaps a little plateau or a little faltering in the last month or so, but it is clearly continuing and we're seeing that improving. So our strategy to get to that 15% should be in place by the end of this year. As we begin the planning cycle, in fact, for next year, we should have the plan in place. When we actually achieve it will be dependent on the economy and metals prices, but certainly by the end of this year, we should have a clear plan, a strategic plan, milestones, and so on, in place, to get to that 15%, dependent on metal prices. Aaron? Aaron Regent - Noranda Inc. - President and CEO, Falconbridge You know, Terry, at this point, my main focus is to get out to as many of the Falconbridge operations as possible as quickly as possible, and I think once I've had a chance to do that and reflect, I'll have a better sense of a time line under which - and specific objectives that we want to accomplish, and a time line as to when we could achieve that. But I think everything we're doing at Falconbridge is - or the direction we're heading at Falconbridge is consistent with what Derek has just laid out. Our focus is on how to do we get our returns up, how do we reach that 15% return on equity objective, and that's driving every decision that we have. Derek Pannell - Noranda Inc. - President and CEO Is there another question? Moderator - Noranda Inc. Ladies and gentlemen, as a reminder, if you'd like to register for a question, press 14 on your telephone. Our next question is from David [Sutnick] with EDS. Please proceed with your question Analyst From UBS. Hi, guys. Just a quick question. Just balance sheet overall, particularly at Noranda. If there is - I mean, if there's a heightened sense to try to reduce debt relative to expectations. Before I know there has been some progress at Noranda with the recent equity unit trust that was done. I guess I'm just trying to sense if it's costs on balance sheet and that's it and if there's a heightened sense at all and if you think there will be significant progress this year on the balance sheet side. Derek Pannell - Noranda Inc. - President and CEO You know, I think as we see metal prices pick up, I would certainly expect to see some progress on the Noranda balance sheet and we're very encouraged with the success we've had on the Noranda income fund. That has been very positive and will flow through to the appropriate ratios and debt - debt to equity ratio. So that's going to have an immediate effect, yes. Aaron? 5 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

MAY 28, 2002 / 8:00PM, FAL_pa.TO^G08 - NORANDA INC Management Changes Conference Call Aaron Regent - Noranda Inc. - President and CEO, Falconbridge I think - David, it's good to hear from you. I haven't talked talked in a while, but. Analyst How are you doing. Aaron Regent - Noranda Inc. - President and CEO, Falconbridge Great. But I think just to add to Derek's comments here, one of the objections we had set out for ourselves at the beginning of the year was to make sure that our debt levels did not rise from where they were at the end of the year, and in fact, obviously trying to head in the other direction. And so there are a number of things that we have been focusing on. The income fund was an important initiative and that went very well for us, so that brought a lot of capital in which has been used to repay debt. Second, we have looked at our capital expenditure programs and we have been curtailing them, to the extent we can, and so that's making a - having an impact. And also, the exchange rate. At the end of the year, the Canadian dollar was 159. Right now it's kind of 153, 154. So that's also taken debt off our balance sheet on an exchange-adjusted basis. So we are making progress, but I think that the major commitment that the company has is to maintain its investment grade ratings and we are not deviating from that objective at all and we're continuing and I'm sure Lars now takes this a day-to-day basis but we're continuing to look at ways to [inaudible] the balance sheet. Derek Pannell - Noranda Inc. - President and CEO You know, I think also add that, you know, we've taken some of the difficult decisions. We're continuing to look to see what else we can do but I think the losses that were being accumulated - [Gaspey], for example - we've shut that down. That is shut down. Everything is empty down there. We've got the working capital that is in the process of coming out of that. We shut down the Warsaw plant. I think you're probably aware of those. Clearly, that - those difficult decisions have been taken and we're looking around to see whatever else flows on from that. But we're very focused on improving the financial situation short-term. Analyst Great. Thanks. Derek Pannell - Noranda Inc. - President and CEO Anybody else out there? Moderator - Noranda Inc. There are no further questions at this time, sir. 6 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

JULY 17, 2002 / 9:00PM, ETFC.OQ^J20 - Q2 2002 E*TRADE Earnings Conference Call The team and I are very pleased to announce our eighth consecutive quarter of ongoing profitability, at 11 cents earnings per share from ongoing operations. We were cash flow positive, we improved interest rate spread, we saw continued success in our cross-sale and up-sale initiatives, and we continued to streamline our very successful business model. These accomplishments are even more significant given the extremely challenging operating environment that all of us face. The financial market recovery did not materialize as investor confidence was hit by geopolitical economic markets and business uncertainties. We saw companies in our industry segment pre-announce mis-earnings forecasts, while others, including many of the large brokerage houses, abandon the online sector all together, due to their incompatible business models and lack of profitability. At E*TRADE Securities, we continue to make the strategic investments to expand and diversify our customer base, and to strengthen our presence in the active trading segment. With the addition of Tradescapes, 83,000 average daily transactions for just the month of June, our average daily transactions for the quarter totaled 109,000, and our run rate exiting the quarter doubled to 166,000. This run rate makes us the leader in the online brokerage industry, as measured by average daily transaction. The Tradescapes acquisition provides our active traders 20 onsite locations, in addition to the New York center, to conduct their trading. We have already made progress in our migration plan to populate our E*TRADE financial centers with professional traders. We now have over 40 professional traders, trading onsite, at our New York center, with an additional 20 professional traders expected by the end of the summer. They are using the market leading technology platform, Lightspeed (ph) . And we expect a transition more traders into E*TRADE financial centers throughout the country by year-end. Now we undertook additional initiatives that increased revenues generated by E*TRADE Institutional. We are executing on an strategic, two-phase initiative, around equity research. In phase one, we recruited an independent research team, formerly from Credit Lyonnais, to provide objective, proprietary, and independent research to our Institutional customer base. In the coming months, our team of six will initiate coverage of over 80 U.S. and European stocks, representing $800 billion in market capitalization, and a pharmaceutical, retail, leisure, technology, and chemical industry. The announcement of this new service has generated significant interest among our existing Institutional customers, and potential new clientele, because of the elevated relevance of unbiased , objective research in today's environment. Now, in phase two, we will leverage what we have already built for our Institutional customers, and make it available to our retail customer base. This group will allow us to off that same personalized, unbiased, independent, objective research to our retail customers with minimal incremental spend. And to take advantage of the growing demand from Institutional traders for direct access to global markets, we are in beta testing with a new electronic trading platform to provide direct access to markets in France, Germany, Switzerland, The Netherlands, and the U.K. We also continue to enhance the value proposition offered to our global retail brokerage customers. We introduce market trader active trading platform in Germany and Hong Kong, provide these customers access to the same Web capabilities as their U.S. counterparts. Now domestically, we continue to enhance our distribution channels to provide greater convenience for our customer household. The company opened an additional seven E*TRADE financial zones, spreading our total to 37 in eight states, with an additional six zones slated to open by the end of this month. 3 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

JULY 17, 2002 / 9:00PM, ETFC.OQ^J20 - Q2 2002 E*TRADE Earnings Conference Call The demographics of customers drawn to our zones are very compelling. Those customers who open accounts at one of the zones, open with a higher average balance, and are more likely to increase their balances to more than twice the amount of our average customer. In addition to our initiatives to increase volume, we continue to review, refine, and improve our brokerage pricing strategies. We implemented a differentiated pricing plan, focused on meeting the needs of our defined customer segments. As a low-cost, value added provider, we enjoy the leverage and flexibility of pricing power. And on July 1st, we rolled out a revised power E*TRADE Platinum flat commission rate of 9.99 for qualifying active trading households. In addition to pricing power, we enjoy other competitive advantages of product, service, and execution qualities for the active trader space. E*TRADE Securities is the only major online brokerage to offer direct access applications, fully integrated with customer accounts, one of the things we do on the product side. E*TRADE Securities offers concierge class, dedicated, personal service for active traders, things we're concentrating on the service side. And E*TRADE Securities is the only online brokerage that allows clients direct orders to market makers and ECN's (ph) to be at the same platform. Again, our concentration on execution quality, which is what the active trader demands and wants. Finally, as a result of those very, very focused marketing spend, almost exclusively on active traders, we acquire higher value customers, quarter over quarter. Trading levels from these new active trader accounts increased 21 percent quarter over quarter, and the gross funded access for new active trader accounts increased 26 percent. Now, E*TRADE Bank, we made a strategic shift away from emphasizing our high-deposit interest rates, towards cross-selling our home equity line of credit products, and building long-term relationships with more valuable customers. This quarter, 25 percent of our mortgage products and home equity lines of credit were sold to existing customers. To further deepen these customer relationships, to attract new customers, E*TRADE Bank introduced it's new Internet banking platform, and a three-tier checking account during the quarter. The new platform offered increased functionality to enhance the customer experience through appealing features such as unlimited ATM refunds, and non-minimum balance checking accounts. We also expect these improvements to help us in meeting our objectives of increasing transaction accounts. We continue to diversify our active portfolio with the goal of widening spreads, as we've committed to, to 200 basis point run rate, by year-end, while remaining singularly vigilant about maintaining absolute credit quality. Now having successfully integrated the auto originating platform, acquired from LenNetwork.com (ph) last quarter, we have begun to directly originate auto loans to our good customers. This quarter, originated auto loans and average FICO score of 761. In June, we purchased $700 million of premium auto loans, with an average FICO score of 763. This raises the average FICO score of our auto loan portfolio to over 730. 4 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

JULY 17, 2002 / 9:00PM, ETFC.OQ^J20 - Q2 2002 E*TRADE Earnings Conference Call Through E*TRADE Mortgage, we have originated over $1 billion in mortgages this quarter, and we've seen that 50 percent increase in new home equity loans and lines of credit, while maintaining high credit standards with our average mortgage customer generating a FICO score of at least 720. Now, during the quarter, we originated almost 3,000 home equity units, and the portfolio is now well over $100 million. On the liability side, we are placing a greater emphasis on providing our deposit customers better service and greater convenience. We experienced and expected eight percent decline in our certificate of deposit accounts, as we chose to no longer offer rates in the top one percent nationally. By diversifying our asset portfolio, and transitioning our deposit base away from higher cost certificates of deposit, we have aligned our interest rate spread to 144 basis points in the second quarter, up from 127 basis points last quarter. And we remain firmly focused on transactional deposit growth. Now, as we invest in and grow our business, we continue to streamline to efficiency and productivity our operating models.

Christos Cotsakos - E*Trade Group, Inc. - Chairman Of The Board/CEO Thank you. Operator Excuse me, sir. You may resume. Christos Cotsakos - E*Trade Group, Inc. - Chairman Of The Board/CEO OK everybody. Sorry, we had a problem with the host that we use for the call connected. I'm going to start back with our expense story on margins. As we invest in and grow our business, we continue to streamline our operating model for increased efficiency and strength as a low-cost leader. To this point, we continue to see the first of our efficiency initiatives, and have lowered our break-even point another six percent in our E*TRADE Securities business, as we focused on prudently our cost of services and operating expenses. We also believe there remains room for additional improvement. Overall operating margins improved to 21 percent, and gross margin improved to 58 percent, as a result of our operational efficiencies and focused on non-transactional revenue streams. Now, this quarter, we've completed several key efficiency initiatives to reduce ongoing operating expenses. We prudently manage marketing and advertising expenses, and reduce our spend rate by $20 million from last quarter, as promised. We completed our migration to the open and scalable Lennox platform. This move gives us the competitive advantage of rapidly and easily deploying and integrating customers facing applications. In addition to benefits from enhanced customer functionality and usability, this move is also expected to contribute over $12 million in annual hardware and software made in savings (ph) . We also implemented new networking architecture that increased incumbency and reduced network latency. This technology initiative helps enhance the customer experience, and increases system liability, now running at 99.4 percent availability. This is also reduced annual networking costs by $5 million. And, we continue to streamline our global back office operation by effectively leveraging technology through simple and effective steps, such as increased in the electronic delivery of trading confirmations, and monthly statements by 50 percent, we've been able to generate $3 million in annual savings. We are very pleased with the progress we have made in identifying and executing on our efficiency and productivity initiatives, but we are not done yet. We're going to continue to pursue additional opportunities to enhance the variable and flexible nature of our cost structure, and will continue to be appropriately diligent about all expenses. Now, through our efforts to streamline operations, sustain revenue and improve earnings, we delivered, as I said before, our eighth consecutive quarter of operating profitability in line with our guidance and enhanced the many leverage points of the operating model. 6 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

JULY 17, 2002 / 9:00PM, ETFC.OQ^J20 - Q2 2002 E*TRADE Earnings Conference Call Looking at all that we have accomplished, I'm very proud of the E*TRADE Financial team, who continue to execute our plan under extremely challenging and demanding market conditions. As a shareowner, I'm very excited about the future that awaits us. And as this company's leader, the team and I are very dedicated to making E*TRADE Financial a trusted leader in this next generation of financial services. Now, before I discuss some surveys that we've done online and our future expectations and what we are doing to prepare for the future, I'd like to turn it over to Len to review the numbers - Len. Len Purkis - E*Trade Group, Inc. - Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Christos. First we delivered net revenues of $316 million as the market experienced some of the lowest trading volume since third quarter of 2001. This represents a $15 million decline over our first quarter in a challenging market environment, with revenue up $8 million over the same quarter last year. On the expense side, we continue to reap the benefits of our ongoing efficiency initiatives and improve their ongoing operating margin by $15 million over last quarter. Second, we were $15 million cash flow positive for the quarter before share repurchases of $15 million. Accordingly, our free cash position remains strong at $335 million, flat with first quarter of 2002. We expect to be cash-flow positive from operations in the second half of the year. Thirdly, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet by retiring an additional $15 million of debt through exchange transactions in this quarter. This brings our total debt reductions to $280 million since last June. We also demonstrated our confidence in our model by repurchasing another 2.6 million shares during the quarter at a weighted average price of $5.66 per share. This brings the total shares repurchased to 33 million shares under a multi-year, board-authorized repurchase program of 50 million shares. So since last August, we've repurchased a total of 40 million shares, which includes seven million shares from Softbank prior to the implementation of the current program. First to our revenues. Our net brokerage revenues totaled $215 million. That's down $9 million from last quarter, with fee-based revenues partially offsetting this decline resulting from lower transaction volumes. Commissions of $71 million were down 14 percent over the prior quarter, and down 29 percent for the same quarter in 2001. This decline was largely due to the reduction in trading activity by massive fluid (ph) and Main Street consumers. At E*TRADE Bank, gain on sale of originated loans was down slightly to 22 percent of net banking revenues from 23 percent last quarter, and down from 32 percent a year ago. Gain on loans and securities held for sale was down to 17 percent of net banking revenues in comparison to 20 percent last quarter, but up from 11 percent same quarter last year. Reflecting our widening interest spread, net banking interest income was up to 53 percent of net banking revenue from 50 percent last quarter, and up from 49 percent second quarter in the prior year. As anticipated, a decline in net banking revenues by $6 million over last quarter is largely due to the reduction in mortgage-related revenue. 7 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

JULY 17, 2002 / 9:00PM, ETFC.OQ^J20 - Q2 2002 E*TRADE Earnings Conference Call Although the interest rate environment remains favorable, refinancing volumes are down from the market peak in the fourth of 2001. And this has affected both our gain on sales of originated loans generated through E*TRADE Mortgage, as well as gain on loans and securities held for sale related to our correspondent flow business. In anticipation of this decline, we successfully refocused E*TRADE Mortgage to increase home equity production. Also, given the continued strength of the general housing market, we place more emphasis on originating loans for home purchases in addition to refinancings. As a result, we were able to largely offset the decline in refinancing volumes, and have developed a more diversified product mix to offset additional reductions in refinancing volumes if rates rise in the coming months. We continue to progress toward a goal of widening bank spreads to 200 basis points. This quarter our interest rates spread at the bank, increased to 144 basis points from 127 last quarter, and up from 88 basis points during the same period last year. The banks risk profile continues to be largely unaffected by our asset diversification efforts, and our portfolio enjoys an average FICA score of over 720. Charge-offs improved for the quarter at 16 basis points on total average assets. That's down from 18 basis points last quarter, and well below the first quarter industry average of 21 basis points. We've also increased our provision for loan loss this quarter to $4.4 million. Reserves of 20 basis points against our loan balance have been established to protect against anticipated future losses. Our loan loss reserve as a percentage of non-performing loans declined slightly to 66 percent from 71 percent in the first quarter due to our prior auto loan production having reached its peak loss period. As our asset classes expand, we remain vigilant in adequately reserving against future losses and continuing to fund provisions for loan losses as necessary. As ever, we will not compromise on the credit quality of our portfolio. On the expense side, our efficiency initiatives contributed to a drop in cost of services to $134 million. That's down five percent from the first quarter of 2002, and down 11 percent from the second quarter last year. These initiatives led to an increasing gross margin to 58 percent, up from 57 percent last quarter, and up from 51 percent same quarter last year. Total ongoing operating expenses declined by $23 million to $115 million, a decrease of 16 percent over last quarter, and a decrease of 18 percent year over year. Selling and marketing equaled $49 million, a $20 million decrease over our first quarter, and a $6 million decrease over the same quarter last year. As we indicated in our last call, our first quarter selling and marketing expenses, including costs associated with the promotion of our rebranding, including our Super Bowl sponsorship. This quarter's reduction in marketing spend reflects not only the one-time nature of these first-quarter investments, but also a more deliberate and targeted marketing campaign. General and administrative expense was $51 million. That's $3 million lower than last quarter and $11 million lower than the same period last year. We expect this to approximate our ongoing run rate for G&A expense. Consistent with our practice of full disclosure and reporting transparency, we created a separate line item credit, which is included in operating expenses, of $23 million called "executive settlement." 8 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

JULY 17, 2002 / 9:00PM, ETFC.OQ^J20 - Q2 2002 E*TRADE Earnings Conference Call This represents the value of the supplemental executive retirement plan, or SERP, and other benefits returned by Christos to the company and its shareowners, and also reflects the terms of his new, two-year employment contract effective May 15th, 2002. This credit is considered outside of ongoing operations for our second quarter financial results, and the benefit is not included in the 11 cents earnings per share from ongoing operations. So income from ongoing operations equaled $39 million, a $12 million improvement over last quarter and a $33 million improvement over same quarter last year. Earnings per share from ongoing operations for this quarter, 11 cents versus eight cents the prior quarter and two cents for the same period last year. Turning to our guidance, we are comfortable with the Street consensus of 45 cents earnings per share from ongoing operations for the year 2002. Our guidance for 2002 has been based on, among other things, transaction volumes for the year being relatively flat with 2001 volumes. Market conditions have been worse than this, and yet we have been able to deliver results consistent with our guidance. Our focus and challenge will be to continue to improve non-transactional revenue, as well as provide offsetting operating efficiencies, to allow us to sequentially increase earnings per share from ongoing operations in the third and fourth quarters. So in conclusion, our focus on both diversifying our revenue streams and improving operational efficiency is clear from our year-over-year results. Revenue is up $8 million from the same quarter last year, and in these results are a decline in net brokerage revenue by $40 million, or six percent, and an increase in net bank revenue by $22 million, or 28 percent. New revenue streams include market-making, professional traders, auto loans, mortgages and home equity lines. And this represents true revenue diversification, both within the bank and the brokerage businesses, and also within the total company revenue streams. Regarding improving operational efficiencies, cost of services declined $17 million from same quarter last year on an $8 million revenue increase. And that's driving our gross margin percent up from 51 percent last year to 58 percent this year. Add to this the efficiencies in other ongoing operating expenses of $26 million, of which marketing is only $6 million, and we have the result of increasing pre-tax income from ongoing operations in the second quarter - seven times the same amount, or seven times the amount same quarter a year ago. So our success in attaining and exceeding our goals despite the challenges we have faces over the past year, and particularly this last quarter, is a testament to the strength of our business model, our strategy and our execution on that strategy. We continue to be committed to integrity and excellence to achieve our stated goals and objectives. With that, back to you, Christos. Christos Cotsakos - E*Trade Group, Inc. - Chairman Of The Board/CEO Thanks, Len. Now, it remains difficult to predict when there will be a recovery in the financial markets, but markets like these build tomorrow's leaders today. Economically challenging times are really the best litmus test for emerging as well as traditional companies, because if you can deliver today, when the markets improve, so do the results as you fully realize your operational leverage. 9 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

JULY 17, 2002 / 9:00PM, ETFC.OQ^J20 - Q2 2002 E*TRADE Earnings Conference Call Amidst the uncertainty of the current environment, we recently surveyed approximately 20,000 unique customers visiting our site. Active traders, high-asset investors, mutual fund investors, customers using the site for research and customers checking their portfolios shared with us their views of the current economic climate. The following gives you a small example of selected insights from the survey. There still clearly remains a lack of confidence in the economy. Despite this reality, consumers are staying in the markets. They are taking a more conservative and cautious approach with their finances, and instead of getting out of the markets all together. In fact, more than half of the unique customers surveyed are opting to stay the course and hold on to their existing equity investments. Yet the fact remains that consumers are not necessarily content to pursue this course alone. Forty percent of the customers report being concerned or anxious about the direction of their finances. We believe that customers are seeking alternative options for maximizing their financial returns, and are looking beyond traditional means currently in the marketplace to find them. And to meet this demand, E*TRADE Financial is going to continue to develop new channels with personalized content to deliver the right information to the right customers at the right time, that is independent and unbiased. Key to our success is our ability to effectively leverage technology to meet the financial needs of our customers, even when they are not trading. Now, the mortgage industry continues to prosper. Thirty-seven percent of customers either recently purchased or are considering purchasing a home, while many other consumers are considering refinancing their home or taking out an auto or personal loan. Following our success in the mortgage business, we effectively cross-sold our home equity lines of credit and loan product this quarter. Going forward, we'll continue to develop and market our new auto loan platform and additional credit products for customers with the highest of FICO scores. There will also appear to be continued opportunity to win a greater share of the banking wallet. Only four percent of customers report having consolidated their bank and brokerage accounts, yet one in five actively moved money between their bank and investing institution, and are considering consolidating their accounts. They also told us that they prioritize low fees and convenience over high interest rates as important features in a bank account. The expanded capabilities of our new Internet banking platform will help us increase product penetration with this valuable household base. Now, there are significant opportunities for driving brokerage revenues in this market environment. A smaller but significant segment of customers - that's one in four - is getting back into the market with the stocks right now. This movement is being led by the active traders, one of our most valuable customer segments. We plan to build on our strong foundation established with Tradescape to continue expanding and aggressively going into the professional trading market while focusing other efforts to re-engage mainstream customers that are in the market today, early in the fall. We have a trusted brand, an excellent financial foundation, sufficient cash reserves. We expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in the second half of the year. We have a diversified, long-term strategy, a six-year track record in a host of market conditions, and the expertise to continue to grow our business, service our customers and deliver long-term shareowner and stakeholder value, while managing risks and our cost base. We are not only strategically placed for the future dynamics and those changes in the financial services industry which we all know are occurring at a rapid pace, but we also are well positioned to thrive when the market, the economy and consumer confidence rebound. 10 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

JULY 17, 2002 / 9:00PM, ETFC.OQ^J20 - Q2 2002 E*TRADE Earnings Conference Call With that, we'll be glad to open it up for questions. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Operator Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. If you do have a question, please press the numbers one followed by four on your touch-tone phone. If at any point your question is answered, you may remove yourself from the queue by pressing the pound key. We do ask that while posing your question, to please pick up your handset to provide optimum sound quality. Once again, to ask a question, please press the numbers one followed by four on your touch-tone telephone. Please hold while we poll for questions. Our first question is coming from Adam Townsend from J.P. Morgan. Please pose your question. Adam Townsend - J.P. Morgan H&Q - Analyst Hi, good afternoon, guys. Christos Cotsakos - E*Trade Group, Inc. - Chairman Of The Board/CEO Hey, Adam. How are you doing? Adam Townsend - J.P. Morgan H&Q - Analyst Good. Just had a couple of questions. How are you reconciling the decline in reported bank customers? The number of customers and number of households appeared to have declined sequentially. Christos Cotsakos - E*Trade Group, Inc. - Chairman Of The Board/CEO Arlen, why don't you take that, and then Mitch and I will follow up. Arlen Gelbard - E*TRADE Bank - CBO & President OK. You know, looking at the big picture, we've been concentrating on optimizing our balance sheet, not only by diversifying our assets, but also focusing on the pricing of our liabilities, as well as cross-selling to E*TRADE Financial customers, both on the credit and deposit products. And this quarter we were actually very encouraged by the results. Because what we've done is, we've revised, as Christos spoke about, the bank's value proposition as we move away from one focus solely, or primarily, on high rates, to one more on value in the form - for the customer - in the form of high year (ph) rates, coupled with superior customer service and superior convenience and access. We're also focusing on changing the mix of our accounts, which emphasize transactional accounts. 11 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

JULY 17, 2002 / 9:00PM, ETFC.OQ^J20 - Q2 2002 E*TRADE Earnings Conference Call What we saw in this quarter was that virtually all outflows, both in deposits and in accounts, came from those customers who would come to us for higher rate CDs, as well as certain expected attrition in our money market accounts. So what we're pleased about, however, is that the attrition was actually lower than that, which we modeled, which to us is an indication that our customers are more sticky and less price sensitive. And we'll continue to develop and refine our products to offer greater value and deepen the relationship with our customers, because our goal is to offer the right product to our customers to meet their demands at all times. Christos Cotsakos - E*Trade Group, Inc. - Chairman Of The Board/CEO And, Adam, what you're seeing is, with nSight (ph) our relational data warehouse, we're able now to look at some of the changing migration patterns of our banking customers as well as our brokerage customers and some of our institutional customers, and look at either putting our marketing power behind where we think the trends are moving, or how we can best optimize profitability in any particular customer segment. So we're more concerned with the profitability and revenue going forward, and optimizing the account penetration for households than we are just grabbing accounts for accounts sake, which become very expensive for you in the long term if they're hollow. Mitch, you want to add anything? Mitchell Caplan - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - President & COO Yeah. And the other thing I would add, Adam, is that, you know, Arlen has been singly focused on the banks. Jarrett's been singly focused on the brokerage. You also have to look at it in the aggregate. So we may have an E*TRADE Financial customer who has either a CD or a money market, has at some point last quarter re-engaged or decided to potentially re-engage in the investing and brokerage business and move money over to a money market account on brokerage in preparation. So that would potentially show a decline in an account on the banking side, but yet there would be a pickup or a net flow of money over to brokerage. Adam Townsend - J.P. Morgan H&Q - Analyst OK. Good explanations. Thank you for that. One other question I had. I was a little perplexed by the weakness of the mortgage lines. I was just reading recently that a couple other banks, Greenpoint and Wells Fargo, had really nice sequential upticks in the mortgage and the Mortgage Banker Association data suggested that through the latter part of the second quarter, you know, even Refi - the Refi index was actually rising, near all-time highs. Can you talk a little bit about, you know, where you're getting new people coming in there, if there's - if we've (ph) exhausted the cross sell opportunity, maybe touch on that for me? 12 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

JULY 17, 2002 / 9:00PM, ETFC.OQ^J20 - Q2 2002 E*TRADE Earnings Conference Call Unidentified Sure. It's exactly what Arlin (ph) and his team have been working on. So, Arlin (ph) . Unidentified Sure. In this quarter, we're also pleased with the results for the mortgage business. You know, as we said when we acquired the company, we acquired it really for two reasons. One is to generate assets for the bank's portfolio, as well as to generate revenue for origination and sale of loans. You know, what we saw is that there was a decline slightly in the refinance volume. But this was, in part, a concerted effort on our part to ramp up the production of home equity loans, which are the types of loans that we like to keep and place into the bank's portfolio, as well as additional focus on trying to develop our purchase money business, which again is more likely to result in loans that we place into the bank's portfolio. You know, if you look at the first - the first mortgage volume, it's only down slightly quarter over quarter. But what's very encouraging for us is that the mix, if you look at between the volume for refinances versus the volume of purchases, you know, in Q1, we had a refi volume of about 85 percent and a purchase volume of 15 percent. But in Q2, our refi volume went down to 65 percent as our purchase volume went up to 35 percent. And this growth in the mix between first and refi is about double the industry average for Q2. And also, as you saw from the numbers, our origination of elox (ph) was up, you know, just in terms of a dollar basis, up 51 percent for the quarter. So we're real pleased with that, as well as the fact that our pipeline is strong coming out of Q2. Unidentified Yeah. And, Adam (ph) , again, what you're seeing is much like what Jared's (ph) doing with the E*TRADE securities in our brokerage division is we're redirecting, based on consumer changing behavioral patterns in insight (ph) . And rather than spending a lot of money on the mainstreaming investments this quarter, where we saw transactions drop and we believed it was going to drop even more significantly in the summer, we refocused that spend onto the active trader segment so we can ensure that we boosted that segment, which we knew from the research was going to be much more prolific than the mainstream customer was, realized that they would probably come back slowly and choppy - right - but in the fall. so you're going to see that continually with us each quarter as we look at what that relational data warehouse is telling us on consumer behavior trend and allocating our resources, our marketing spend and where we're looking for efficiencies from one product or one service to another, based on what division or diversification that we've got throughout the entire company, which really does become a great strength of ours in this current environment that we're in. Operator Thank you. Your next question is coming from Glen Shore (ph) from Deutsche Bank. Please pose your question.

JULY 17, 2002 / 9:00PM, ETFC.OQ^J20 - Q2 2002 E*TRADE Earnings Conference Call Unidentified Hi, Glen (ph) . How you doing? Glen Shore - Deutsche Bank great. The first thing, maybe from Arlin (ph) . Oil loans now 14.4 percent of the bank portfolio. What is the upper end of your comfort range there? Unidentified At this point, we're working with our - with our product mix. You know, we're ultimately limited, as an institution by our QTL, our qualified thrift lender test. But we haven't set an upper limit. In large part, you know, we look at the percentage that we want to have in mortgages and mortgage-backed securities and the rest in other, meaning. Glen Shore - Deutsche Bank That's the - that's the 75/25? gary? Sixty-five/35. Glen Shore - Deutsche Bank Sixty-five/35. gary? But otherwise, you know, what we will end up with ultimately as a mix really depends on the market, what the market has to offer us. Unidentified Gary (ph) , again, it's the same - the same comment - right - with regards to 65/35. We're going to - we're going to put those resources where we think we get the biggest bang for our buck, both short and long term. gary? Right. And the - and the... Unidentified We're paying strict attention to all the customer segments, all the products and services almost on a weekly basis. Glen Shore - Deutsche Bank On the portfolio that you just picked up during this quarter, you've commented on the high FICA (ph) scores. Can you give us a sense for what the yield pickup is and if it's leased or new loans and where you're sourcing them from? Is it all from Chase? 14 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

JULY 17, 2002 / 9:00PM, ETFC.OQ^J20 - Q2 2002 E*TRADE Earnings Conference Call Unidentified It's not from Chase. But I can't really discuss where it's coming from. It's coming from - it's direct origination. They're newly originated loans. It's a reasonable mix, slightly skewed in the favor of used orders as opposed to new orders. But they are - you know, they have customers who have, as we said, the very high FICA (ph) loan - FICA (ph) scores. And that's really about it. Glen Shore - Deutsche Bank No comment on the yield pickup? Is it similar in that 40, 50 basis-point range over your mortgage portfolio? Unidentified No comment on that. Glen Shore - Deutsche Bank OK. A couple housekeeping... Unidentified Glen (ph) , he's not going to let you back into the number for the model. Glen Shore - Deutsche Bank I'll still try. How about the reserve quarter to quarter? It doesn't look like much change. MPAs (ph) are pretty flat. And the provision went up a little bit. Is the reserve basically unchanged quarter to quarter? Unidentified I assume you want me to take that, Mitch (ph) ? Unidentified ... is it a unchanged. Unidentified Yeah. Basically, they are unchanged. Unidentified That's it, basically unchanged. 15 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

JULY 17, 2002 / 9:00PM, ETFC.OQ^J20 - Q2 2002 E*TRADE Earnings Conference Call Glen Shore - Deutsche Bank OK. Maybe just one more clarity point on guidance. So the top line, obviously, is weak. The outlook is not great. Trading stinks. Mortgages are coming off of their peak. And you made a comment that the GNA, we're, kind of, near their run rate. So I understand margin expansion. A nd the cost saves that you outlined on the technology side, is that enough to get us to that 45 cents that you reiterated is there more across the board on each of the expense lines that we're expecting? Unidentified I think where we're going to - if you look at where we are on six months, we've obviously done 19 cents... Glen Shore - Deutsche Bank Right. Unidentified ... in a real tough environment. But if you look at our gross margins, we're still looking at those being in the high 50s to maybe 60 percent in this environment. And the GNA and take that (ph) , the marketing being in the same sort of percentage through revenue as they are for the first six months. But what you're really looking for to get you to that 45 EPS, 45-cent EPS is you're going to see two key drivers. One is going to be the bank achieving its interest rate spread expansion. And the other is just going to be ongoing efficiencies with the programs we've got in place. So there's a very clear program as how we get from the six-month arena to the 45 cents. Unidentified And remember, Glen (ph) , we're not - you know, we're not looking at the 45 cents singularity. We're looking at the dollar EPS, which is what we're driving for in the near term and to show that we can leverage this model in most environments. And when it does flip around, we can take a larger percentage of the transaction revenue that we get and drop a large margin of that to the bottom line. So, you know, there's an exogenous event (ph) out there that makes things very difficult. Certainly everybody is under pressure. But given where it currently is today and given how we performed in this quarter, we're still not being able to meet the transaction volume that we had last year because remember, previous guidance we said that the transaction volume would have to be flat to slightly lower plus to meet our guidance number, again, it was significant lower and we still met it. And that gives us a lot of confidence on how we're executing on really three areas - one, how we manage risk, two, how we manage our cost; and three, a lot of the innovations that we're doing in our technology group to leverage that in our operating model. And that currently gives us some good confidence. And, Mitch (ph) , you want to add anything? 16 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

JULY 17, 2002 / 9:00PM, ETFC.OQ^J20 - Q2 2002 E*TRADE Earnings Conference Call Unidentified Yeah. And, Glen (ph) , last point is two things. One is clearly, we've guided conservatively with respect to both cost of services and operating expenses. I think you know Christos (ph) drives me pretty hard to focus on that. And so, I think you'd expect for us to continue to be vigilant about that. As well, when you look at the top line growth, you can figure out as well as anybody what happens is we continue to widen bank spreads and how much that helps in terms of pickup. Also, what we are seeing and I want to give, sort of, cautious but general guidance around the mortgage business. One of Adam's (ph) earlier questions was about, you know, how do you look at, you know, the flow of revenue and income from your mortgage business. For the first time, we are different than Greenpoint (ph) and others. We're balancing what we put on balance sheets and widened spreads against what we choose not to put on balance sheet and sell into the secondary market in (ph) a gain. So one thing that is comforting is you will see us right now exiting - and we haven't seen these sorts of numbers for a while - exiting Q2 with over $500 million in the pipeline around the mortgage business in loans. So based on the refinance index that everybody's seeing in the marketplace, we are no difference than what's happening everywhere else. We see that as a huge opportunity. And it will either show up top line revenue growth in the gain on sale or in the widened spread or more accurately, in some combination of those two. Unidentified I think lastly is you could have a somewhat stronger July and maybe a weaker August and maybe come out again a little stronger in September, which could balance things out across the board. So we're watching that carefully. But the first couple of weeks of July are very encouraging. And they certainly are much stronger than they were the last quarter. We do think that will slowdown in August but maybe with a pickup in September. So that gives us also some confidence, again, barring anything exogenous our control. Operator Thank you. Your next question is coming from Richard Griketo (ph) , from Putnam Level (ph) Securities. Please pose your question. Richard Griketo - Putnam Level Securities Yeah. Hi, guys. Unidentified Hey, Rich (ph) . 17 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

JULY 17, 2002 / 9:00PM, ETFC.OQ^J20 - Q2 2002 E*TRADE Earnings Conference Call Richard Griketo - Putnam Level Securities Hi. First question is on the other brokerage revenue, we've seen a nice up tick this quarter, actually in last quarter, as well. And I think you alluded to a little bit on the fee-based - when you made a comment on fee-based revenue. Can you just give us a little bit color of, you know, what's causing the up tick, Glen (ph) ? Unidentified Yeah. Well, Glen (ph) . Then we can have Jared (ph) follow it up since he runs that division. Unidentified Yeah. On the brokerage revenue, remember, we've got mutual fund fees in there. We've got BSGs (ph) , predominantly fee-related income. And we introduced the handling fees this quarter and other fee-based revenue. There's also a maintenance fees in there. But it's really coming from the increased fee revenue that's really been introduced this quarter. Unidentified Jared (ph) , you want to add anything? Unidentified I guess the only thing I'd add to that is, you know, this is - this is a good base to work from. That increase is recurrent. Unidentified You know, Rich (ph) , I would tell you, the other thing that we're working on now that we have the three strong divisions with Jared (ph) , Arlin (ph) , with banking and brokerage and Josh (ph) in technology, we're looking at what we can do with software licensing and revenues, et cetera, to build up the technology revenue stream that we can have in the company. And you'll have three strong diversified streams, all helping to mitigate different changes in consumer behavior or in the marketplace, depending on what aspects of the business you're in. So it may not be next quarter but the quarter after, you'll start seeing Josh (ph) report now from his division as we realign some things, the revenue and responsibility he's got. And the numbers will be coming out of there. Richard Griketo - Putnam Level Securities OK. And my last question, you know, I got to ask this question. You know, is there anything - or what is your feeling, Christos (ph) now, you know, with investors since the comp issue? You know, is there anything we can do? The stock's been off significantly since the end of April. We know the steps you've taken. What's your feeling towards, you know, the reaction to the stock and invested behavior here. And we know it's been tough market conditions too? 18 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

JULY 17, 2002 / 9:00PM, ETFC.OQ^J20 - Q2 2002 E*TRADE Earnings Conference Call Unidentified Well, I think we've been - you know, we - you know, it was a contentious environment between, you know, the shareholders, the board and us. Let me tell you three or four things that we've done. First is we've really over delivered on one, not only what I stated I was going to give back, but even gave back much more than that, especially to our associates, as well as more to our shareholders to show that I am certainly in line with regard and have always been with our shareholders. Secondarily is, with a really shortened contract, which is very simple, easy to read, no nonsense, to show the tough economic and challenging times that we're all in. That's, kind of, number one. Number two is, on the corporate governance side, we meet almost all the NYSC (ph) list of requirements now for governance. We are adding an outside independent director that we hope to have on board before the end of the year. We also have our corporate governance committee. And we do have a lead director, by the way, and a fully independent governance committee/audit (ph) committee. And we're evaluating all the charters of outside counsel to make sure that we use the guidelines with Calpers (ph) to make sure that we are in compliance with absolutely unequivocal great corporate governance across the board. And then, thirdly is once the summer's over, I'm going to go back around to all the large investors and institutions and talk to them, with Mitch (ph) and with Glen (ph) about where we are with the dollar, where we are with regard to company, its execution of its plan and where we are with where we think we are with this great model and leverage. So we believe that a good portion of that is behind us. As you know, we still have the soft bank overhang, which is a part of the issue. There are $15 million - there are 15 million shares. We still have people worried about light transaction volume in the summertime. And the whole sector is just out of favor. But we believe, if you look at where we are from a valuation standpoint now and where we're trading as far as the multiple goes, it's very attractive, going forward, good value, good technology, good business model. And when the market does come back, we're going to be well positioned. So we think a lot of that stuff, Rich (ph) , is behind us. And we thank you for asking that question. Richard Griketo - Putnam Level Securities Thanks, Christos (ph) . Operator Thank you. That will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over for further (ph) comments. Unidentified Yeah. I just want to thank everybody. Have an enjoyable summer. And let's look forward to the market coming back in the fall. Thank you. Have a great day. Operator Thank you. Thank you all for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a great day. Thank you. 19 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

We met or exceeded all of our internal targets, our objectives are in line, our costs are in line, and we achieved our earnings forecast both internal and external. On a consolidated sales basis, for the quarter, our second quarter revenues was 4%. Comparable worldwide sales were flat for the second quarter, and declined 1% for the first half of the year. 2 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

JULY 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q2 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call Our worldwide E-commerce sales, our leading position worldwide, drew 38%, and on a year-to-date, and we are, in fact, to exceed more than $2 billion in E-commerce this year. No one sells more over the Internet than Office Depot does. Business to business office supplies,we are the biggest. Our results continue to believe that we expand that leadership. On a company-wide basis, our customer complaints dropped 32% from last year. This is in spite of an improvement in the second quarter last year. We are reaching all-time high indices in satisfying our customers. Our indexes across all channels increased. The weakening U.S. dollar which primarily impacted us in the month of June, favorably impacted in total quarter two sales by $15 million. But on a year to date basis, we are still $5 million negative compared to last year as a result of currency in the first five months of the year. On a total sales growth perspective, our retail comps negative 1% for the second quarter, representing our fifth consecutive quarter of improving comp trends. Our North America comp transactions were up 3%. A very encouraging sign in our North America retail stores. The cost decline was driven primarily by continuing declines in hardware sales, with desk tops and laptops, comping down 16%, and the category overall, which then includes monitors, printers, all-in-one machines and digital cameras, was down 12% in the quarter. Our total technology sales, which two years ago were about 22% of our sales, have now dropped to be 14% of our sales, reflecting the last two years of difficult comps in this technology sector. BSG sales grew 4% during the quarter. Sales improved for our contract division across all regions quarter to quarter, but was offset by some continued softness in our Office Depot and our Viking catalog domestic business. The average order value in our business BSG business improved for the first time in six quarters, another encouraging sign of a small recovery in the large and medium customer segment. And our domestic E-commerce business, here in North America, grew 37%. International comp sales were 4% in local currencies. Japan and Viking catalog both had negative comps during the quarter. Excluding those two countries, international comps were 7% for the second quarter. And we had improved trends in Germany, the U.K., Netherlands, Italy and Ireland. On a consolidated operating basis, our operating profit increased 15% to $92.7 million, versus $80 million in 2001. Our quarter two North America retail operating profits grew 35% and achieved its highest return on sales since the first quarter of 2000. That does exclude the $12 million estimated charge we took for the settlement of the California wage litigation suit that was outlined in our press release. Our BSG operating profit was up 10% to 8.1% of sales. International division operating profit was flat reflecting the entry of two new countries, Spain and Switzerland. Four new Office Depot BSG startups in Europe, and continuing losses in Japan. And in spite of that, this division still achieved 12.5% of sales of operating profit. Our consolidated gross margin grew 27 basis points overall, primarily all in North America retail. I'll talk about the gross profit in each of the business segments. Our BSG and international gross margins had both slight decreases. BSG down 192 basis points. That's the inclusion of 4Sure.com, not in the numbers last year, improved inventory management, meaning our purchasing from key suppliers is less than planned, which affects our vendor rebate programs. And international was down slightly as a result of higher retail sales mix and a growing BSG mix in Europe, and an increase in prospecting, which are lower margins in some key countries as we ramped up our efforts to grow new customers successfully. The key operating drivers of operating expansion and retail were margin improvements and our -- and, again, another quarter of improvement in BSG selling and operating costs, which in the quarter improved 234 basis points. On a consolidated EPS basis, on a fully diluted GAAP reporting basis, EPS grew 29% to 18% for the second quarter, compared to 14 in the second quarter of last year. As you know from the release, included in the operating income this quarter, is a one-time charge of approximately $12 million or two cents per share for the anticipated settlement of a class action lawsuit in the state of California alleging that Office Depot incorrectly classified its retail store managers and assistance store managers as exempt from the payment of overtime hours worked in California. As you've seen in news recently, this is not unique to Office Depot. Excluding these one-time litigation charges, EPS grew 25% to 20 cents, versus 16 cents for the second quarter, and on a year-to-date basis, EPS has now grown 52%, to 50 cents versus 33 cents in 2001, reflecting the improvements we've made in the operating performance at Office Depot. Now I'll speak briefly about performance in each of the key segments. The North America retail sales, as I said earlier, we had another consecutive quarter of comp sales improvement. Our supply sales, our core office supply sales, continue to show improvement with positive comps during the quarter. Our second quarter product mix furniture was down 1%, overall, as I said, technology/hardware was down 12% versus 13% in Q1, a small improvement, and software was slightly up in quarter two. Our average ticket size, in spite of the increased transactions in the stores, and increased traffic actually declined, reflecting the impact of lower furniture sales and lower technology sales. We in the quarter, we converted our 12 Canadian Ontario Providence stores to Office Depot, and we experienced a lift in revenue since that conversion. We now have the right for the first time in our history for the Office Depot name throughout Canada. 3 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

JULY 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q2 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call We are converting more of our customers who come in to our stores to buyers than ever before and a result in the second quarter, in that regard, were quite encouraging. As I said earlier, our customer service index is measured by our customers. Our customers today are giving us feedback in two primary ways. One at the register and one when they walk out of the store, was up substantially from year-ago levels. North America retail operating profit was up 180 basis points in the second quarter, a 35% increase, excluding the litigation charge. As I said earlier, that's the highest operating profit performance in our North America retail stores since the first quarter of 2000, in spite of negative comp sales of 1%. Our retail margins continue to improve our gross margins this quarter, by 185 basis points over last year. That's primarily a shift away from technology, the continuing benefits of our remerchandising which we've talked about numerously, better SKU management and quicker sale-through of our clearance merchandise which results in less markdowns. Our store operating costs, excluding the California litigation costs, improved slightly from last year. That's a result of better controls on merit increases and the nonanniversarying of some of the merchandising initiatives we implemented during the second quarter of 2001. On the BSG side, our total sales, was, as I said earlier, increased 4% for the second quarter. Our contract division has positive growth in the second quarter, showing some signs of recovery in the economy in all of our regions. Our western region still has negative sales growth where we've been most impacted by the slowdown as a result of the dot-com blowups but it improved over the first quarter. We still expect this division to continue to improve throughout this year as we focus on this segment to grow. Our second quarter revenue per order was higher this quarter than in any quarter during the past five quarters. Our average order size is improving, another small sign of an improvement in this sector. As I said earlier, our domestic E-commerce sales, which are in this business segment, grew 37% for the quarter and continue to grow our industry leadership position. Our warehouse customer service indexes were up across all categories. Our service level up, our on-time delivery up, our customer complaints were down, our call centers performed better than ever as a result of our consolidation last year from 24 to 7, and our customer complaints in the second quarter dropped 45% in the second quarter a year ago in the business segment. Our operating profit basis in this segment, our second quarter operating profit improved by 42 basis points from 7.7% last year to 8.1% in this quarter. Our second quarter gross margins declined in this segment 192 basis points. As I mentioned earlier, that is primarily the result of the inclusion of 4Sure.com, which wasn't included in the these numbers a year ago, some short-term pressure on vendor rebate in key suppliers in this segment, as we've improved our inventory turn in this channel to the highest in the industry. Our second quarter selling and operating expenses were down 234 basis points in this quarter. Again, reflecting the improvement in quality that we've now had consistent in this segment for well over a year. Our DSO in this segment improved again from 51 days to 46 days, and you can see these improvements in turns and our DSO as reflected in our strong cash position at the end of the second quarter, and our growing free cash flow position as we focus on managing our business more effectively and more efficiently. From an international perspective, based on first quarter trends, we saw some improvement internationally during the second quarter. Second quarter sales internationally in U.S. dollars grew 12%, again, a little bit from the benefiting of the currency in June in particular. Second quarter comp sales and local currency were 4% and 9% in U.S. dollars. As I said earlier, foreign currency translation benefited us in this quarter by a positive impact of about $15 million in sales and positively impacted operating profit in this segment by about $2 million in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, however, foreign currency translation still negatively impact sales by about $5 million, and now are about neutral on an operating profit basis. Our contract sales startups in our new countries are all still meeting or exceeding our initial plans, and each of the four countries we have these new divisions. As I said earlier, we had two countries, internationally, Viking Catalog France, and Office Depot Catalog in Japan, both comp negative in the quarter, and overshadowed somewhat the improvement we saw in the rest of the countries. Our retail comps in France where we decided to make a major position in retail grew 5% in local currency and 11% in U.S. dollars. Our Office Depot business in France, which includes retail, catalog and the launch of a new BSG division grew 19% in local currencies against the very difficult economic environment in France. Our retail comps in Japan were negative 10% in local currency and negative 14 in the U.S., continuing to reflect the softness in the overall economic condition of Japan. And in Japan, during the quarter, we opened two new stores, closed one store, bringing a total of twelve stores in Japan.

JULY 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q2 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call an operating profit basis, operating profits in this quarter were flat as planned year over year, but still 12.5% of sales. And as I said earlier, this reflects our commitment to continue to invest in this high return on sales, high RONA business, as we grow this business for the future. Two new countries so far this year, Spain and Switzerland. Startups in four new countries in DSD and plans to open another additional country late this year and probably one next year as well. Gross margins slightly declined by 91 basis points in the quarter, mostly the result of a higher mix of DSD and retail business, and a higher prospecting percentage of our business in our key European countries to grow our business. Store and warehouse operating costs only increased by 51 basis points in spite of the startup costs of Spain, Switzerland and the DSD units, all of which lose money in their initial startup period of time. Our Japan losses improved on a year over year basis to 1.5%, $1.5 million operating loss during the second quarter, compared to $2.5 million operating loss in the first six months of last year in spite of negative growth. As we get our arms around Japan and drive that country for efficiency and profitability. Our operating margins have been impacted, as I said, by the addition of new countries, and in the second quarter, for example, we absorbed more than $6 million of operating losses as we grow our business for the future. We have, as you all know, the most successful international business of anyone in our segment. We have been overseas since 1990. We know how to make money. We're investing this business, and these losses that we absorb today will, we believe, turn into substantial profits in the future, and in spite of some of the issues and the concerns about the economy, we're optimistic about our position in Europe. In summary, looking towards the remainder of 2002, based on all we know today, we remain comfortable with consensus earnings of $1.02. That implies that our second half EPS will grow close to 15%, and for the full year, close to 30%. The slower half, second half of EPS growth, is now anniversarying the substantial improvements we made in the second half of last year. We expect retail -- North America retail sales in the low single digits for the remainder of the year with some improvement or higher in the fourth quarter. We believe there'll be some improvement in both technology as a result of the HP Big Band launch, which is HP's largest launch ever of new printers, technology and ink, and we have and remain to be a destination store for HP products, and we believe we can grow in that segment. We also anticipate a back-to-school season that is slightly better than last year in our forecasts. In the BSG group, we expect mid to single-digit growth rates in quarter three, with higher growth in quarter four as we focus our growth in the higher-business segment, and we've successfully proven so far this year that we're able to do that. Internationally, we expect double-digit currency growth, low double-digit currency growth, in the second half in local currencies. Reflecting on the quarter, as I said in the beginning, in spite of the negative comps in North American retail, we continue to make substantial improvements in our business. Our margins overall are strong, sustainable. Our operating costs have trended positively now for some period of time, we're executing better than ever in our history, and today, we believe we have a solid foundation to grow this business in the future. If you allow me to reflect for a moment, tomorrow is my second anniversary as the CEO of this Company. I celebrate my two years. Our Company during that period of time has dramatically changed. Together with the leadership team we've built, we've transformed this Company's culture to one of focusing on customers, employees and shareholders. Two years ago, I said our primary goal was to gain the trust and confidence of the people who work with this Company, to improve the retention and the quality we provide service to our customers, and to gain the trust and the confidence of shareholders. This is our eighth consecutive quarter of meeting or exceeding consensus estimates. I said two years ago that we would build an executive leadership team that we could be proud of, that could help grow our business. We're primarily done with that. Most of them in the room are with me today, and I'm proud of what they've accomplished. We established a solid foundation. We have integrity, trust, and confidence in our balance sheets, our numbers, our cash flow, our balance sheet has never been in better condition, now in particularly in light of our decision to call the alliance. All of you saw Greenspan's speech yesterday, and he talked about a crisis of confidence. I can assure you there's no crisis of confidence at Office Depot and the integrity of our numbers, the soundness of our balance sheet. We've accomplished a lot in two years, we've closed underperforming retail stores, we've improved our warehouse quality and efficiency. We were the first to rationalize new store growth, and we continue to invest in Europe. We now have a platform to grow here in North America. We believe we've identified ways in which we can grow, that are not impulsive, but are well planned and we believe with our confidence, we can execute those plans, albeit in a difficult economic environment. We've identified new customer product verticals across all channels here in North America. In retail, we have new formats being tested, new in-store small business services and we're using and introducing technology to deliver on our promise, what you need, what you need to know. We continue to invest, to grow our large customer DSD segments. We think there's an opportunity 5 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

JULY 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q2 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call to gain share in that segment by focusing the improvements we've made in our warehouses, our costs to acquire, our customer profitability, and we are confident we can grow in this segment. Internationally, we continue to stay the course. We invest not only for the future but at the same time we deliver industry-leading impressive results on return on net assets, return on working capital and return on sales. We believe there is not a crisis of confidence at Office Depot. We're focused on the things to make this a better company, our employees have told us it's a better place to work. Our customer indices have never been higher. We face a difficult economic environment, the last four or five weeks, certainly of the stock market and the capital markets, bringing the question, "what's the economy going to be like both domestically and internationally?" We're confident of our ability to execute. I don't think there's ever been a better time to invest in Office Depot. Kind of a summary of the results of the quarter and my comments, what we'd like to do now is open up the call for your questions. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Operator Thank you. At this time, if you'd like to ask a question, please press star one on your touch-tone phone. You will be announced prior to asking your question. To withdraw your question, press star two. Once again, to ask a question, please press star one. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Operator, are you still there? Operator Yes, one moment. We're waiting for questions to register in our queue. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Eileen Dunn - Office Depot, Inc. - Vice President Invetor Relations, Public Relations Operator? Operator One moment, ma'am. Your first question comes from Matt Kassler. Matt Kassler Thanks a lot, good morning. A couple of questions if I could. First of all, given that you now have some clarity as to your financial situation, do you know what you're planning to do with the [INAUDIBLE] and you have a very substantial cash position and continue to generate substantial cash, and given that the stock has come under some pressure, are you contemplating, or would you contemplate any kind of share purchase activity? 6 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

JULY 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q2 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Matt, good morning to you. The good news in the sense that's it's good, I say the good news, it's certainly mixed news. We're not the only stock that's been substantially revalued in the last couple of months. We do have an authorized buy-back of stock that was authorized by our Board some time ago, and that authorized buy-back was $50 million. We have been on a planned gradual buy-back of that stock, and we're about 2/3 through with that buy-back. I think, we've said all along, and I continue to say all along, that our goal is to drive RONA. We've demonstrated in the last two years, we've done that in spite of very low growth world wide. And one way or another we'll increase the RONA. Ideally, what we'd like to do with that cash is to grow our business. And as I said earlier, we've spent the better part of a year and a half or two years, building a foundation which I'm confident we can grow on, including selectively look at opportunities to acquire. The LYONS redemption that we just announced, has the impact of acquiring basically 13.9 million shares. And so in some respects, it's a buy-back of shares by the redemption of LYONS that we've called. Our Board, myself and our management team, are focused on driving RONA. And having said that, cash has to generate returns. We have, we think, some exciting opportunities that could require some cash in the future. They're retail formats that I spoke earlier about. Customer product category segments. But we clearly identify opportunities to grow. We've got plans to grow, we're not prepared to talk about how we're going to do that. But we believe we can identify uses of our cash that grow this Company's top line, grow its bottom line and grow RONA, and that's what this management team is committed to do. And I might add, a year ago, this management team with shareholder approval, took a very different view about stock and options and how we get paid as executives. And the conclusion is as follows: if we outperform a selected group, a large selected group of companies, we do well, as a management group. If we don't outperform, and that's on shareholder value, we don't do so well. So we're driven per shareholder value, and that means we have to clearly always look at how we use cash. Matt Kassler So not to put words in your mouth, but to kind of summarize, it sounds like -- it sounds like you want to keep your powder dry for strategic uses of cash? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer I think the summary I want to keep my powder dry. There are growing opportunities to look, frankly, I think the readjustment of the capital markets, readjust valuations of opportunities. I've said all along, I believe there are opportunities, particularly in Europe, where we have an incredibly strong base, a very strong management team and a strong platform and we continue to look and evaluate those. And I'd like to be in a position always of, if opportunities come forward, we're in a position to compete, and on that basis, I want to keep my powder dry, if you look at it from that perspective. Matt Kassler Gotcha. Second question, if I may. Just looking at the income statement, one line that was different from my expectations was corporate GNA, where as a percent of sales, I believe, you rose from about 4.2% to 4.8% and you had risen in the first quarter as well. There's also sequential dollar increase. Can you talk a bit about what's happening on that line item and whether we should expect continued year-to-year increases in the corporate GNA numbers? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer From our perspective, we look at GNA two different ways, Matt. We first of all, look at our core GNA, what's happening with the core employment base in GNA, what's happening to that growing, and I can tell you that without question, that's well under control. The GNA is influenced by the startups in particular, because that's where we put the, that's where we put a lot of the costs, and we've opened two new countries so far this year. We've got DSD starting up in four countries, we've announced a new one. Actually, Italy starts up in a month or two, and we're also starting to occur some costs as we announced the German startup of DSD. 7 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

JULY 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q2 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call We've got part of our, part of our, corporate-wide bonus system is based on our ability to achieve EPS objectives. We are on track to achieve a higher bonus payout corporate-wide. I'm not just talking to executives, I'm talking about for the people on bonus systems around the world. We're on track to achieve higher levels of bonus payout than a year ago, based on the fact that at $1.02, we'll have grown EPS this year, somewhere near 30%. That implies higher bonus payout, that's in the GNA cost. And, third, without quantifying, I'll tell you that we've invested in some strategic projects. We've taken a look at customer product growth opportunities, we think we've identified some very interesting things, and that's got a short term impact on GNA growth. We will continue our investment internationally. Part of the GNA is a percentage [INAUDIBLE]. When revenue does not grow as planned. overall, then the GNA looks higher as a percentage. But I can assure you, that we're not wasting our GNA dollars. On our core processes, I think we've been a leader in the use of the Internet to take costs out of our business in routine, more routine jobs, and then we turn around, invest for growth in the future. I can't emphasize this well enough. We don't have an environment where we demonstrate our ability to grow. I want you to know we've invested an enormous amount of time, and we believe we have a platform now to grow, and that leads to future shareholder value. So I hope I answered your question, Matt. I hope I wasn't too defensive about it. But I believe the investments we've made will have payouts in a huge way in the future to our shareholder value and our ability to grow the Company top line. Matt Kassler Okay, thank you. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer You're welcome. Operator Your next question comes from Daniel Bender. Daniel Bender Good morning. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Hey, Dan. Daniel Bender A couple of questions for you. First off, on just store closures, how many more should we expect this year, if any? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer I don't anticipate any more than we've announced. I've said all along with a portfolio of stores of 860-plus in North America, we'll always have openings, closings, but in terms of material closings, we said that we would close 14 more this year. We're on track to do that. I don't anticipate any major change in that direction. Albeit, at any one point in time, when a store comes up for remodel, and we are for renewal, and we have some later this year, we could make a decision on a store due to close, but materially, we're not closing any more stores than we've announced. 8 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

JULY 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q2 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call Daniel Bender Okay. Great. Other question related to -- I guess the sensitivity of your EPS to, let's say, a percentage point in comp store sales, your margins have been obviously moving up, and it's been probably a little bit tougher for some of us to determine what a deviation in comps, up or down, would have on it as an impact on your EPS. I was wondering if could you give us any sense of that? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer I think directionally, you can still make a broad assumption that a 1% change in the North America retail comps equates pretty close to a penny. One of the things that we've been able to demonstrate, your point, Dan, is that we have been able to adjust a lot of our variable costs to track more in line with comp sales growth. And should we experience some pressure on comp sales growth in the second half, I think there's some ability we still have in our variable cost structure, but I think we've been pretty good now demonstrating two years, but directionally, you have to assume that a 1% change in North America retail costs is about a penny a share. Per quarter. Daniel Bender Okay. And in the back half of this year, it sounds like you're continuing to look for sequential improvement in the rate of comp store sales gained at retail, although those are against, I guess, slightly more difficult comparisons last year in the back half versus the front half, and I guess with all that said, it sounds like most of the pressure has been in technology and furniture, and I'm just curious, do the comparisons in technology and furniture get easier as we move through the remaining part of this year? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer It's somewhat easier, but I think our optimism, and I would say our cautious optimism for a moment, in our North American retail business, is really focused on a couple of areas. One, is we do think that we'll see some lift in technology in our retail stores, and by technology, I mean basically laptops, desk tops and all-in-one machines and printers. I think all of you've seen that HP is launching their biggest launch in their history. Some 50 different SKUs over the second half of the year, both new technology, better technology at lower price, and we believe we've always been an HP destination. Frankly, HP has always been our largest single supplier worldwide by quite some margin. We believe that these products will sell. We've got some early signs they are. And we think that's going to give us some lift in the second half of the year. I think second of all, we anticipate a slightly bit of back-to-school season this year, not dramatically better, but still an improvement over last year. We did pretty well last year, we think we've got some specific plans in place, both for products and promotion, if you will, that we believe, we remain confident today that will have a little uptick in our back-to-school. To the extent that there's an indication of that, our contract business, which has a clearer segment in back-to-school this time of year, has got a good order booking. This is stuff that's in the house that will shift this quarter to next quarter. That's part of the lift we're getting in BSG. So it's those two assumptions that we think we're going to get, we're going to turn the chain on comps to positive in the third quarter, and a little more positive in the fourth quarter. We're also putting a lot of emphasis on the holiday season. We've always been a destination for holiday purchases of businesses, and we've got some exciting things we're planning for that, and I appreciate in light of the overall economic concern of both the U.S. and the world, you say what does all of that mean, and frankly, Dan, at this point, I don't know. I just know what we're doing. And I remain confident that we'll execute it well, and I think there's some uptick here. Daniel Bender Okay, just a last question, in your press release, you do cite that you're testing multiple new retail formats, so obviously you wanted us to know that. I'm just curious if you can give us any more detail on what that involves? 9 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

JULY 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q2 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer No, I won't. Daniel Bender Okay. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer This is the age-old issue in retail. I guess one day I'd like to -- I'd like to have the culture and the history of Southwest Airlines. Where they'll tell you a year in advance where they're going to go, how they're going to do it, when they're going to do it, at what price they're going to do it, and not a competitor in the world can seem to match it with that kind of advanced knowledge. We're not at that point yet at Office Depot in our retail business. I think similar tests some work, some don't. Frankly, we're excited about some aspects of it, but we're not ready to extend specifics to it, because the minute we do that, it turns into well, how much cost is that going to that be, and when's that going to be, and how many are you going to add? I just want to leave all of you with this is a business that we, in North America retail that we do not consider dead. While you might argue there is saturation of some stores in some markets, and I wouldn't argue against that, this is a business segment that's $285 billion big, and our share of it's very small, and there are customer product categories in which we enjoy a decent share of the customers we target. We believe there's a whole growing share of customers that we don't. And we think we've identified some ways to reach them. I think the proof's in the pudding, and I'll wait until we can report increased comps, increased growth and then tell you more specifically how we did it. I just want to leave you with the solid foundation that this is a company that's spent a couple years now building a foundation, and I think it's in place. And I think now we can start to do better things to grow our North America retail business. Daniel Bender Great, thanks. Operator Your next question comes from Aaron Robinson. Aaron Robinson Hey, I think that's me. Bruce, I hope the next two years is as prosperous as the first two. I had a quick question. The BSG number looked like it ticked up a little bit and the gross margin ticked down a little bit. I'm not sure if you explained it, but are those two related? In other words, is pricing down, therefore, some elasticity is getting increased market share, and then I had one follow-up. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Okay, thanks for your wishes for the next two year term as well. I hope it is as well. This has been the most exciting thing I've ever done, frankly the most rewarding thing I've ever done. It's something I'm most proud of, the team that's helped build it, so if you'll allow me those personal comments in the midst of a "crisis in confidence in America". Your second comment is, are those things related, growth in BSG and margin, and the answer is, no. Our core BSG margins actually grew slightly in the quarter. There is an impact with the vendor programs, inventory turns are well ahead of what we thought. What that means without going into enormous amount of detail, is that we now face the risk of some key vendors of not hitting their maximum rebate levels as a result of total volume purchases. And good, conservative accounting says that you recognize that at this point in time. And so, there is pressure short term on 10 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

JULY 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q2 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call supplier rebates, and that's impacted in the totals. Second, as I said earlier, there's a mix issue, 4Sure.com was not in our numbers last year. This is a lower margin business model that we believe speaks to how people buy technology when they bought their second or third piece of it. They don't go to a store. They want specific help, and we invested in this business by acquiring it a year ago. We are optimistic about where it goes, and we're encouraged by its -- by its new direction or its uplift. So, no, this is not related. I do think if we get more successful in the larger segment, and I believe we will, I think that's a mix issue, and I think you'll see then on a mixed basis our margins come down a bit, because the reality is, larger accounts have lower margins. That is true. But that's not the case in this quarter. Aaron Robinson Follow-up, as far as the retail business is concerned, how are you going about merchandising back-to-school given the mix shift from consumer to business? How do you get your merchants, I guess, into a consumer mode and make sure they come out of that consumer mode once this thing is done and to what degree are you working back-to-school versus last year? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Those are complex questions, some of which are answers, but I'll wait to see unfold when you walk into the store and see our back-to-school set. First of all, I would say -- I don't know, I think that back-to-school in North America retail both for us and our competitors has an awful lot to do with consumers and not as much to do with business. I mean, if you look and profile the customer, I think we get an awful lot of consumers in our store, for back-to-school, at least we do. I know by demographics we do. Frankly, our goal is to bring them into the store this year, delight them with the product selection, delight them with the complete school list for their school, delight them by giving back 5% of their purchases to their school of choice, which has been an enormously successful promotion, and delight them with service so they say, "Hey, I'll come back to Office Depot in the future for some of my quote consumer home office individual needs." So that's one thing. Two, is I think our merchandise selection this year for back-to-school, it's assortment and it's display, from my perspective and my eyes, and appreciate those are the eyes of the self-serving, CO of the Company, are better than last year. I've seen the back-to-school set in our store, it's out earlier, and I like it better. I think the product selection is better, I think the graphics are better, the signage is better, the flow is better. And, three, we're going to selectively -- back-to-school is always a competitive period. You're already seeing signs of it being competitive in terms of early advertising of it. But we think our in-stock position, our product breadth and assortment, our 5% back is going to drive traffic into our stores and our hope is that traffic gets impressed so much, they come back later. So there is some optimism we have in back-to-school in that regard. It's not huge, but we're saying it's going to be better than last year. Aaron Robinson Thank you very much. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Aaron. Operator Your next question comes from Peter McMullen. 11 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved. Republication or redistribution of Thomson Reuters content, including by framing or similar means, is prohibited without the prior written consent of Thomson Reuters.

JULY 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q2 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call Peter McMullen Good morning. Two quick questions. One, with all of this talk about options, I just wondered what your philosophy going forward might be, and, two, as you sit today and look at '03, what major factors would you have us focus on in determining, you know, some sort of hurdle rate for next year? Thank you. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Your first question on options, Peter, is one I think, we have an upcoming Board meeting. I intend to have this discussion, we've had it. We've broken out, according to the guidance of the regulations, if our options were expensed last year using the methodology that we put in our annual report, that would have the 12-cent EPS impact. I think the whole issue of options, who gets them, how many they get, in light of the current economic environment means we have to take a look at it. I can tell you that this Company has not abused that. It's not given mega-grants to executives. None of us that are here today have gotten enormously rich on options. Our option program is clearly in line with industry. Our total options in terms of total dilution are well below the upper-third core tile, we're more in the middle of what companies do. We go deep with our options. That I'd like not to avoid. We give options to store managers. I know that's sometimes contrary to shareholders viewpoints, but to a store manager that works in North America, option grant's a big deal, and I'd like to be able to keep something like that in place. We put a new option program in place last year with new performance standards that are clearly performance-based, and they're based on this management dream driving shareholder value. One of the issues I have with all of the legislation, is an over reaction to some companies that have had excessive greed and have violated both the integrity and trust of the investors, and we deal with that. This Company's done neither of those things. We've not restated, we don't have to restate. We don't have mega-option grants. I think the whole issue of what we do is a good discussion for a Board to have. I'm not prepared to talk about what that might be, because I think it's dialogue and discussion. And second, I think you have to look at the environment that's external. And whatever the law is, we'll comply not only to the letter of the law, we will comply to the spirit of the law. And that's been our objective all along, as it relates to all three, I think as you look at all three, I think the overall issue is what's the forecast for the overall health of both the North American and the global economy. We're still a business that has impact by economic benefits. We'll continue to make into '03, I think, smaller, gradual improvements in our cost structure. We've gotten huge costs out of this Company in two year, we've gotten efficiency. It's harder to continue to get it. We find ways to drive processes better, faster and more efficiently, we'll continue to do that. But I think when you look at '03, you've got to make large assumptions about how the Company grows. Because if the world economic environment or the North American one deteriorates and gets worse, then I think this Company, along with most others I know, will have difficulty growing EPS and growing shareholder value in the next year given the economy. So I think you say our margins are sustainable? I know there's always been questions about, is the gross margin we've got sustainable? Well, we've got five, six quarters at it, so I hope you believe they're sustainable. We've said that we'll get gradual improvements in our cost structure. Are they sustainable? We've got five, six quarters of it? I think soon we'll get some more. We've said we'll invest for growth in the international that will pay. Some of our investment growths a year and a half ago are paying handsomely today, so I think that's kind of the outlook for '03. I think it's overshadowed, if you will, not by what this Company can do and execute, because it will, but the external environment, which right now seems uncertain at least for most people who look at it. I'm not an economist, but what happens globally in the next year and a half, will have an impact on our next year's results, obviously. Peter McMullen Thank you. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Peter. 12 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

JULY 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q2 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call Operator Your next question comes from David Young. David Young - Bernstein Hi, David Young at Bernstein. A couple of questions. Can you comment on, given that your Internet sales now make up over 50% of the BSG group sales, can you just comment on the relative profitability of your Internet business versus the other BSG businesses? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Yeah, first of all, the Internet business, it comes from multiple channels. It's in the BSG. It's our total Internet business, in that, as officedepot.com, which is the public site and BSG Net, which are the private sites for our contract, commercial customers. By definition, all Internet transactions of Office Depot cost us less than any other transaction, period. And that number's approximately 1%, 2%, depends on how you calculate it, from a call center costs, from a fax cost, from a phone cost. Two is, our Internet business has always been profitable at Office Depot on a fully allocated cost basis it is fully integrated. It has never been a separate business. We've always looked at it as an enabler. An order in a North American warehouse, which we have 24, for an Internet, for a fax, for a phone, for a contract sales rep order, for an order placed in retail for delivery is all of the same to a North American warehouse. They can't tell the difference. So it has all the metrics of every other order, and so we continue to say it's an enabler. Our objective is to make it the best site of sites in the land, to make it easier on the contract commercial side to convert. We have more third party conversions in our contract business than anybody else, bar none. We're easy to convert for private side and commercial contract business. Our officedepot.com site has always been profitable. We have never chased customer acquisition at insidious rates. We do it smart, we do it wisely, we use E-mail wisely, but it is not a separate business, it's an enabling part of our business, and it continues to grow, and we believe it will become an even higher percent. On the BSD side, the contract side, over half our transactions today come through the Internet, and we think that will continue to grow. David Young - Bernstein I see. So you don't measure separately from profitability standpoint? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer No, we don't. Because that's -- that's a channel conflict inside the Company. David Young - Bernstein I understand. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer There's no reason to do that, because we share the platform, the technology, the skill base, the analytical base, the front-page, back-page, middle-page, software interface across all channels, across all companies, and we do it worldwide. Our engines are the same on the back end of these things. Our front ends are customized. 13 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

JULY 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q2 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call David Young - Bernstein Are the 4Sure.com numbers included in the Internet numbers that you quoted, that growth number? And if so, how much did it impact the growth? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer The answer is, I don't know the answer to that, David. We'll get that answer for you. Off the top of my head, I don't know that. David Young - Bernstein Okay. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer We'll come back to you on that regard. David Young - Bernstein A couple of minor questions, housekeeping questions, what are the planned store openings for the year? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer 23 to 25 new stores. David Young - Bernstein Okay. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer We're on track to do that. David Young - Bernstein Okay. And the last thing is, then, you might have commented on this in the first quarter, and I apologize if I didn't catch it, what was the reason for the share count increase? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer I'm going to let Charlie Brown, Charlie, the CFO, is by my side. I'm pretty sure I know the answer, but I want to make sure it's the right answer, so I know Charlie knows the right answer, so, Charlie? 14 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

JULY 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q2 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call Charles Brown - Office Depot, Inc. - Chief Financial Officer The number of shares that was really influenced by option exercises, we had, as a stock, increased during the first and second quarters, we had a large number of employees who exercised their stock options. David Young - Bernstein I see. OK. That's the increase in the basic share count? Charles Brown - Office Depot, Inc. - Chief Financial Officer The second basis, remember when the stock does go up and more options are in the money quote unquote, higher numbers of shares outstanding go in the share outstanding calculation, and we had a rising stock price, substantially rising stock price through the first quarter of this year. David Young - Bernstein Okay. Thank you very much. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from David Asasio. David Asasio Hi. I jumped on the call a little bit late, and I may have missed this earlier. I was hoping you could discuss a little bit your motivations behind calling your LYONS. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer I'd be delighted, David, to discuss the motivation behind calling the LYONS. And I'm going to turn that one over to Charlie as well, Charlie Brown, the CFO of Office Depot, Charlie? Charles Brown - Office Depot, Inc. - Chief Financial Officer Well, the, probably the origin of thinking of calling our options, really had to do with constantly looking at our debt structure. As we go out and look at potential acquisitions, the LYONS really become cumbersome, because, you know, there's the uncertainty of will they or will they not convert? That's probably the first consideration. The second, is that where our share price is currently, and, you know, depends on what our outlook is for the full year, there's a highly likelihood that these options will be [INAUDIBLE] to us in December. But at some extent, what we've done is really accelerate that and cleaned up our debt structure a little bit to give us a little more flexibility, and that's really the reason behind it. 15 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

JULY 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q2 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer I would add to that that given our dramatic improvement in free cash flow, our growing cash balance, which this quarter approached $1 billion, our continued belief we can continue to manage the balance sheet well, we think that it is a good use of cash at this particular point in time given the price of the stock and the strike put price of the option which can be put to us late this year. And as I said, then it adds to the other things about balance sheet, reduce debt, and so we look at it as saying it's a good use of corporate funds at this point to do that, based on what happened in the capital markets, and particularly within the last month or two. David Asasio Okay. Thank you. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer You're welcome. Operator Your next question comes from Brian James. Brian James When the LYONS get called, what does that do to interest expense and what does it do to number of shares outstanding? In fully diluted? Charles Brown - Office Depot, Inc. - Chief Financial Officer The number of shares, I think as we mentioned in the press release is about 13 - 14 million shares that will essentially come out of the EPS calculation. In terms of interest rate, these are 5% convertibles, so essentially, what we're getting a little bit of a negative arbitrage between what we're paying versus the interest income that we're earning, which is just under 5%. But given where interest rates are currently, it's essentially a break-even. Brian James Okay. Thank you very much. Operator Your next question comes from Whitney Pilson. Whitney Pilson Hi, two questions. You referred earlier to the competitive environment and the back-to-school season. I was wondering if you could just speak more broadly about what the economic slowdown is so forth, are you seeing a worsening of the competitive environment for you? And second question is, can you give a little background on why your primary internal evaluation metric is RONA as opposed to return on equity or return on invested capital? 16 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

JULY 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q2 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer I'm going to answer the first question. I'm going to have Charlie answer the second question on RONA. Yes, we will tell you. No, I dont' think we've not seen a worsening of back-to-school at this point. We've not seen a degration of pricing at this point in time. We've just seen early on, earlier advertising of back-to-school. Back-to-school really doesn't start the first flight from our perspective, starts the last week of July. We realize the country goes back-to-school at very different times, and it starts the last week of July and flows through almost into September. It's a complicated system, by the way, to figure out when you advertise back-to-school and what region or locality. What we're seeing right now from the competitive arena, is that early advertising of back-to-school, which, in our perspective, is two, three weeks early. But it isn't focused on price. It appears to be focused on, we've got to come in and see it, get your back-to-school early. So I don't know what the price environment's going to be. I can always, there's always three or four, five items, particular items that mass retailers decide to highlight and drive traffic in. I mean, that's just always the way it is. We would anticipate that would occur this year, and have anticipated that. But, no, I don't think we've seen a change in the environment, just a little surprise that we've seen advertising, and I would say the form of the advertising, if it's in ROP, that won't mean much to some of you, but that's more expensive than inserts, and it's means you've reacted quicker. So it looks to me like it's going to be an advertising early game on pricing, it's hard to say what it's going to be like. Charlie, on the RONA versus the return on equity? Charles Brown - Office Depot, Inc. - Chief Financial Officer Mathematically, those two metrics work out to be essentially the same, it's just a question of how you compute them. We like RONA, because what we're able to do, we can't do with return on investment capital, is break down the drivers on RONA to think that are meaningful to our operators. These are things like DSO, these are things like inventory turns, and by breaking it down to that level of granularity, what we can do is engage the entire Company in driving returns as opposed to just the executive groups sitting around and talking about return on invested capital. So for us, RONA is really, it's a living, it's a breathing, a concept, and, again, we can take it down to the store level or into our call centers or into our warehouses, and that's why we like it. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer We can take RONA to a store manager level, which we do, because there's some things a store manager has control of, and there's some things they don't. And when you get return on equity, there's an awful lot of things a retail store manager has nothing to do with return on equity. Charles Brown - Office Depot, Inc. - Chief Financial Officer They really can't relate to it. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer They can't relate to it, but they can relate to RONA and over time these two things track pretty closely, anyway depends on how you calculate them. So we've chosen RONA as a way internally to align 45,000 people to what you really have to do, when it's all said and done, to drive shareholder value. And you have then some impact clearly. Bob Keller, who runs our North America delivery business, has a huge impact on RONA on how much capital he wants to put in warehouses and how many -- what his receivables are. He doesn't have a huge impact on whether we choose to finance it, that equity, you know, with interest to it, but it's not in his level. RONA and investment is, and that's true for other business unit operators as well. So we've gone through this argument a lot in our Company and we've settled on we think it's easily -- more easily communicated, more easily understood and people, like store managers, can clearly understand their role in it. So that's our perspective on RONA. Whitney Pilson Thank you. 17 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

JULY 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q2 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call Operator And your last question comes from Derek Weiner. Derek Weiner Yes, hi. There seems to be some confusion on the call price for the converged for the LYONS that you're calling. I believe it's in the press a couple of different ways. Could you clarify what the call price is, is it an accreted value since the 74,355 that would have been in December? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Yes, it is at the accreted price and would be 1,753. Derek Weiner 74,355 was the December price. What would the price be of the call? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer $17.53. Okay. It's actually the accreted value as of August 19th, I think, which is the end of the window. Derek Weiner But it would be something greater than $74? Something greater than $74.355? I don't understand the -- Charles Brown - Office Depot, Inc. - Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I don't have that calculation. Eileen Dunn - Office Depot, Inc. - Vice President Invetor Relations, Public Relations If you'll call us back after the call, we'll go through that calculation with you. Derek Weiner Okay. Simplistically speaking, to account for interest between August 19th, from the 74,355 on December 11th, is that correct? Charles Brown - Office Depot, Inc. - Chief Financial Officer Yes, it would be with the accrued interest at that point in time. Derek Weiner Right. I think you needed to clarify that in the press. 18 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

JULY 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q2 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call Charles Brown - Office Depot, Inc. - Chief Financial Officer Okay. Thank you. That's a good suggestion. Derek Weiner Thank you. Operator At this time, there are no further questions. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Okay, thanks again for taking your valuable time to listen to Office Depot. I hope we've clearly articulated and summarized both our confidence in our ability to execute, eight continuous quarters of meeting or exceeding what we outlined we would do. Saying what we do and then doing it, is how you gain trust and credibility, having pristine financial statements, financial reporting and a balance sheet is about what we're about, and then growing our business is where this group is focused. We spent two years refining, improving, getting a solid platform. We believe we're in better shape today than ever, both from an executive leadership team and knowledge of our customer and product segments that we think we can wisely invest for growth in the future. Thanks for listening. Thanks for your confidence in Office Depot. We look forward to talking to you on our mid quarter update, which we'll do towards the end of August, which will then give you more insight into the current trends of quarter three.

CORPORATE PARTICIPANTS Operator Larry Sala Anaren Microwave - President and CEO Joe Porcello Anaren Microwave - VP of Finance CONFERENCE CALL PARTICIPANTS Analyst Unknown Speaker PRESENTATION Operator Good day, everyone and welcome to the Anaren fourth quarter earnings release. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for introductions and opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Larry Sala, President and Chief Executive Officer of Anaren Microwave, Incorporated. Please go ahead, sir. Larry Sala - Anaren Microwave - President and CEO Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for participating in the Anaren Microwave, Incorporated, fiscal fourth quarter 2002 conference call. I'm Larry Sala, President and CEO, and I'm joined today by Joe Porcello, Vice President of Finance. First I must provide a brief update relative to Celeritek. I will then provide an overview of the results of the fourth quarter and the June 30, 2002, after which Joe Porcello will give financial highlights. We'll then take your questions. The statements contained in this conference call which are not historical information are forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed. You're encouraged to review Anaren's fourth quarter press release and Anaren's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30th, 2002 and the exhibits to those reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to learn more about the various risks and uncertainties facing Anaren's business and the potential impact in Anaren's net sales and earnings. Anaren disclaims any intent and obligation to update any forward looking statements. With respect to Celeritek, we attended Celeritek annual shareholders meeting last Friday, and at our request later met with Celeritek CEO and CFO. The meeting took place at the offices of the Celeritek legal counsel. At the outset of the meeting Mr. Husseini [phonetic] informed us that Celeritek has decided to pursue the standalone strategy. Celeritek's outside counsel subsequently informed us that there were several reasons why Celeritek was rejecting Anaren's request to conduct due diligence. Yesterday we were informed by Celeritek counsel that Celeritek continues to prefer a standalone strategy but offered Anaren the opportunity to meet with Celeritek's board of directors and if they were willing to enter into a standstill agreement, they would consider allowing Anaren to perform certain due diligence investigations. Anaren's management continues to believe in the merits of the combination between Celeritek and Anaren and the potential benefits to shareholders, customers, and employees of each company. Due to the disappointing response from Celeritek, Anaren has to consider all of the alternatives available to it and may pursue one or two of the possible actions as outlined in our schedule 13B. Net sales announced - on to results for the quarter. Net sales for the quarter were $21.5 million up 37 percent from the fourth quarter last year and up 8 percent sequentially from the third quarter fiscal 2002. 2 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

AUGUST 06, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q4 2002 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call Operating income for the quarter was $361,000 compared to operating income of $112,000 for the fourth quarter of last year to $551,000 to the third quarter of fiscal 2002. Excluding the results of Anaren Europe, formally the [inaudible] company and Amitron which we acquired in fiscal 2002 Anaren would have had a net fourth quarter sales of $18.4 million and operating income of $1.6 million. Net income for the fourth quarter was $2 million for nine cents per diluted share compared to $1.2 million or five cents per diluted share of the fourth quarter of last year and $1 million or four cents per diluted share for the third quarter of 2002. In the fourth quarter we recognize income tax credits and export tax benefits of $850,000. Excluding the impact of the income tax benefit, net income for the quarter was $1.2 million or five cents per diluted share. The revenue growth in the fourth quarter was driven by wireless group. Wireless group net sales for the quarter were $15 million, up 12 percent sequentially from the third quarter. Eliminating the impact of the acquisitions of Anaren Europe and Amitron wireless group net sales increased 10 percent sequentially from the third quarter. The growth and wireless group net sales was a result of increased market share of components at several leading infrastructure manufacturers and improved sales at our Europe Anaren subsidiary. Anaren Europe is currently producing prototypes for qualifications by four leading wireless infrastructure manufacturers, demonstrating the successful integration of Anaren Europe technology into our global sales force. Wireless group customer concentration for the quarter as a percentage of wireless group net sales was PowerWave to 21 percent, Ericsson at 18 percent, Motorola at 8 percent, and Nortel at 5 percent. During the quarter we continued to make excellent progress on our new product initiative development and we continue to develop products that will increase our contact in wireless infrastructure applications as well as 802.11 wireless networking and access point and client application. During the quarter we sampled products through [inaudible] manufacturers for 802.11 application. We believe our price and performance is very competitive with alternative products and technologies. We anticipate introducing more than ten new component products before the end of the calendar year. For the space and defense group net sales for the fourth quarter were $6.5 million down 1 percent or from net sales of $6.6 million for the fourth quarter of last year. Space and defense group new orders for the quarter were $4.9 million including an order for antenna distribution networks, a military satellite program. The initial order is for just over $1 million for the development phase in this program. The total opportunity on this program for Anaren over the next four years is in excess of $10 million. This is the first significant military satellite win for the company, greatly expanding the addressable markets for our space technology. Space and defense backlog at June 30th, 2002, was approximately $33.5 million. During the quarter we also continued to establishing our operating presence in China. Our facility is now complete and we anticipate initiating production there during the second quarter of fiscal 2003. Joe Porcello will now review the financial highlights. Joe Porcello - Anaren Microwave - VP of Finance The financial highlights of the fourth quarter income statement and balance sheet of June 30, 2002 are as follows. Gross profit margin for the fourth quarter, fiscal 2002, was 29 percent. This was a 3.1 percentage point decrease from gross margins of 31.2 percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2002 and a 7.5 percentage point decrease in gross margins of 36.5 percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. The declining gross margins in the third to fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 resulted from a change of shipment product mix. The fourth quarter mix included large volumes of lower margin Ferrites products compared to the third quarter. Excluding the Anaren Europe and Amitron acquisitions, gross margins were 35.6 percent for the fourth quarter of 2002 compared to 39.2 percent in the third quarter and margins of 36.5 percent in fourth quarter of last year. Investment and research and development as a percent of net sales was 8.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2002 compared to 8.9 percent of revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2002 and 8.7 percent of the fourth quarter last year. Research and development expenditures have risen [inaudible] over the past year due to a reemphasis by the company on developing new standard component products for the wireless market.

AUGUST 06, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q4 2002 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call effort has culminated in a number of new circuit product introductions over the past six months. We anticipate R and D spending will continue at this higher rate over the next fiscal year as we continue our new product development effort. Income from operations was 1.7 percent of revenue in the fourth quarter compared to 2.8 percent of revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2002 and 7 cents percent of revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. Operating margins declined over the third quarter due to the change in sales mix in the fourth quarter with the higher shipment levels from the lower margin Ferrites products. We presently did not expect a significant improvement in operating income over 2002 levels without additional increase in sales volumes and the returns to normal production levels at our Anaren Europe subsidiary. Income before taxes for extraordinary item was 5.7 percent of revenue for the fourth quarter. This compares with the loss before taxes for extraordinary item of 6.4 percent of revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2002 and income before taxes of 11 percent of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2001. The improvement over third quarter was attributable to an increase in other income Anaren Europe resulting from the extinguishment of the long term capitalized lease liability due to the fire loss. This amounted to approximately $200,000. During the fourth quarter of 2002 the company finalized an analysis of certain available research credits and export tax benefits. As a result of this analysis the company received expected research credit covering the last two fiscal years and export tax benefits relating to 2002 foreign sales activities of $850,000 or four cents per share diluted in the fourth quarter. Prior to recognizing the tax benefits, the tax expense for the quarter was $70,000, three-tenths of a percent of net sales and an effective tax rate of 5.7 percent. This compares to tax expense of $542,000 or 3.4 percent of net sales for the fourth quarter of the prior year. Going forward, the company's effective tax rate will be impacted by the local tax credit, nontaxable interest income, export tax benefits, and income loss generated by the company's foreign subsidiary. Based on anticipated results for fiscal 2003, we expect the company to effect a tax rate between 23 and 25 percent. In connection with purchase of Anaren Europe in October 2001, we reported a $3.4 billion extraordinary gain in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 to recognize the negative goodwill resulting from the transaction. During the fourth quarter Anaren Europe had an operating loss of approximately $1 million, the same as the third quarter's operating loss and an improvement over the second quarter operating loss of $2.4 million. Net income as a percent of revenue was 9.4 percent for the fourth quarter including 4 percent attributable to the fourth quarter tax credit and benefits. This compares to 7.6 percent for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 and 5 percent for the third quarter of fiscal 2002. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2.2 were nine cents including four cents for the tax credit invested. This compares to five cents per dilute share in the fourth quarter [inaudible] year and four cents per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2002. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $125 million June 30th, 2002, down 7.2 million from June 30, 2001 due mainly to $12.1 million of cash being used to purchase Amitron and Anaren Europe in the first half of fiscal 2002. Cash generated by operations was approximately $17 million in fiscal 2002. The company also had a stock buyback authorization which authorizes the repurchase of up to approximately 2 million shares of the company's outstanding stock. The company intends to repurchase shares from time to time by means of open market purchases and privately negotiated transactions at prevailing market prices. The number of shares purchased, if any, will be dependent upon market conditions. No shares were repurchased under this authorization during the fourth quarter of 2002. Accounts receivable were $13.1 million at June 30th, 2002, including $2 million at Amitron and Anaren Europe, up $1.6 million from June 30, 2001. The accounts receivable levels without Amitron and Anaren Europe fell approximately 3.3 percent during the year. Day of sales outstanding at June 30, 2002 were 56 days compared to 67 days at June 30th, 2001. We continue to expect day sales outstanding to fluctuate between 55 and 75 days as we go forward, depending on current sales level, customer mix and business conditions. 4 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

AUGUST 06, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q4 2002 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call Inventories at June 30th, 2002, were $20.1 million compared to $18.6 million June 30th, 2001. The inventory increase was due to the addition of Amitron and Anaren Europe at approximately $2.1 million in inventory together at June 30th, 2002. Inventory levels without the acquisitions declined approximately 3.2 percent during fiscal 2002. Capital equipment placed in surface in fiscal 2002 amounted to approximately 9.7 million. $5.8 million of these additions represented new equipment purchased by Anaren Europe between October 2001 and June 2002 to replace the fixed assets that were destroyed in the July fire. The remaining additions were for the Ferrites production in our [inaudible] facility, automated production equipment for our for our power [phonetic] subsidiary, and new multilayer ceramic manufacturing equipment at Amitron. The accounts payable June 30th, 2002 were $5 million up $2 million from June 30th, 2001. The acquisition of Amitron and Anaren Europe amounted to $1.4 million in the increase of June 30, 2002 and the remaining $600,000 rise resulted from the current prices and higher business level. Larry Sala - Anaren Microwave - President and CEO Thanks, Joe. I'd just like to make a quick correction that Joe referenced to the purchase of Anaren Europe and the extraordinary gain which we recorded was $3.4 million not $3.4 billion, obviously. As in previous quarters, visibility from our wireless customers remains very limited. Given the current level of market visibility of projecting net sales to be in the range of $19 to $21 million and diluted earnings per share to be in the range of two to four cents for the first quarter of fiscal 2003. We will now take questions. 00:31:26 QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Operator Thank you. Today's electronic question and answer session will be held electronically. If you would like to ask a question, please press the star key followed by the digit one on your touch tone phone. Once again, please press the star key followed by the one to ask a question. We'll take our first question today from Mr. Mark McKechnie. Analyst Thanks, good afternoon, Joe and Larry. Larry Sala - Anaren Microwave - President and CEO Good day. Analyst 3 billion, huh? The 802.11 products, can you tell us a bit more on those, first what they are and then also when you expect to start seeing some revenue there? Joe Porcello - Anaren Microwave - VP of Finance Yeah, I guess at the current time we're trying to the assess a little bit the functionality of the product over the supply, but I think suffice it to say it's a relatively simple function [inaudible] product of our supplying to the front end of 802.11 applications and sell for price points probably below 25 cents and offer sensitivity improvement over current technology approaches. 5 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

AUGUST 06, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q4 2002 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call As far as time frame for generating revenue, that's a difficult one for the forecast. We would expect, you know, historically when we introduce a product to our customers there's a design in time, there's a reproduction time and then there's a launch and we start seeing revenues and that's historically been nine to twelve months. This is a newer market for us. We believe has potential to move a little more rapidly, but we have no history to be able to give you an absolute time frame. Analyst Okay. Thanks on that. The second question is on, then, [inaudible] take a little hit there and I guess I understand what's happening there with 5M, but can you - and I guess that was also from a higher mix of Ferrites. Joe Porcello - Anaren Microwave - VP of Finance Higher mix of Ferrites. Analyst How was - is your strategy similar in defense and wireless or - Larry Sala - Anaren Microwave - President and CEO Actually the market base in defense right now are as good as the normal wireless margins here, yes. Analyst So they're a bit higher. So what dragged you down was the 5M cost and just to refresh, when do you stop seeing the impact from 5M? When, you know, is that something that runs out two years from now or something? Larry Sala - Anaren Microwave - President and CEO Well, it's just dependent upon our ability to generate incremental business at our wireless infrastructure customers. We reported that we are prototyping now for the four leading infrastructure manufacturers. Any one of those opportunities would be appreciable revenue stream relative to 5M or enter into Europe, current revenue rate. We're also moving some of our internal productions to Anaren Europe from external sources that we currently use which will help some. From the time line standpoint we're hoping that we have some mitigation of the losses at Anaren Europe by the first of the calendar year. We do not expect to see, you know, significant impact from the new business development activities until the later part of the fiscal year. Analyst Okay. And one final question, then I'll hop. You mentioned visibility, still kind of spotty a bit, six to eight weeks or so back booking? 6 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

AUGUST 06, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q4 2002 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call Larry Sala - Anaren Microwave - President and CEO Our booking hasn't changed appreciably, but the volatility has probably increased some over the past two months to three months. We still have yet to see standards in time from our customers. We haven't seen people greatly moving out or shortly in the meantime, but the volatility and predictability over the last couple of months has increased. Analyst Now, you still getting normal forecasts for December or are you getting forecasting that far out yet? Larry Sala - Anaren Microwave - President and CEO We're not really seeing demand that far out. We only see [inaudible] forecast out in the next, you know, few weeks or so. Analyst Got you. And then I've looked at your guidance for next quarter, but on the south line, kind of flat, you know, plus or minus a bit. Is that going to bring in some incremental market share gains as well? Joe Porcello - Anaren Microwave - VP of Finance We're fairly confident that we continue to at least maintain or gain market share and expand our customers institution a bit. Always one of the more challenging quarters for us, [inaudible] quarter, quarter in which [inaudible], and, you know, we continue to see relatively steady customer concentration the last quarter. We haven't seen any big change in our customer base and don't anticipate any significant change in our customer distribution, but same in general trying to be a bit softer this quarter than last. Analyst Great. Thanks. Okay. Great. Operator Thank you. Our next question we'll go to Rich Valera with Needham and Company. Analyst Good afternoon, Joe and Larry. Larry, on the Celeritek, can you describe what the standstill agreement consists of and do you plan to sign that? And then go forward with the due diligence that they've offered you at this point. Larry Sala - Anaren Microwave - President and CEO You know, I have limited ability to comment. I would say first, there were really no terms provided yet for any standstill agreement, just a general concept. Really can't comment at all on any specifics to what that agreement might entail. This is all fairly recent news to us and so we - I can't comment on any decisions that have been made yet on the way we'll go forward. 7 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

AUGUST 06, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q4 2002 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call I guess our concern is that we feel we're getting somewhat of significantly conflicting messages where management has been very clear in their position of maintaining a standstill, standalone strategy while counsel has offered us some other options. Our concern is, again, continuing to drag out time and not make appreciable progress here. So we'll continue to evaluate it and we'll continue to disclose decisions as we make them. Analyst Okay. And on the - it looks like combined 5M and Amitron were around $3 million. Can you give us the split of how that broke out? Joe Porcello - Anaren Microwave - VP of Finance Amitron is about $1.8 million of that split. Analyst Okay. So can you feel - you saw a little pickup in Amitron from one of the medical customers that you're expecting to come back, or do you expect more of a contribution from them at some point? Joe Porcello - Anaren Microwave - VP of Finance Fairly consistent out of Amitron. They have broader market diversity than the rest of our business with more like 50 percent of the business being medical applications and those few customers and the rest of the business pretty easily split between wireless and defense applications, so they're fairly steady and we'd expect that to continue as far as we can see. Analyst Going forward. But their break even is around $3 million per quarter, so they're sort of running it, you know, a little more than half break even or is it better than that? Joe Porcello - Anaren Microwave - VP of Finance No, we believe their break even is - it's more like the two, six range. Analyst Okay. And you mentioned a little bit about the product that you're developing at 5M. Can you give under the circumstances any idea on the either the applications or the sort of dollar content implications of these new products for each either a PA or base station, depending where they go. Larry Sala - Anaren Microwave - President and CEO On 5M we're basically seizing currently one of the high power amplifier circuit board opportunities. BWB which our transistors would fit within a power amplifier. 5M has what we believe are some unique technology to metal back microwave circuit boards providing better thermal performance and cost and competing technology. 8 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

AUGUST 06, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q4 2002 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call We typically, I would say, see opportunities in the range of, say, $30 to maybe $75 dollars of content per PA is a typical range of opportunities we see. So if you look at standard production raises, it's a fairly high dollar content opportunity for us relative to entering Europe's current revenue rate. So given typical amplifier run rates are thousands to tens of thousands, the dollar opportunity there with any one win, with any one customers is fairly appreciable and oftentimes - let me qualify that. Our customer are multiple source, and at least two sources is very common. So we are very, I guess, positive in the results to date of willingness of customers to give us an opportunity to get qualified. It leads us to believe we're price competitive with our initial quotations. That's definitely an opportunity for us to participate and gain share in this market. We believe it's going to be another two quarters before we can say we're getting program win as a result of the activity today, so I would say so far relatively we're - it's coming along. Analyst One final question sort of leads into what you were saying. Assuming market demand levels remain where they were for the next several quarters, let's say out through the end of your June fiscal year, your June '03 fiscal year, when do you start seeing growth from some of the new product, any activities that you have going on that are above and beyond that are just core run rate business? Larry Sala - Anaren Microwave - President and CEO We're hoping, you know, with the introduction of products that we made last February, our normal expectations would be seeing an impact from those in the second half of this current fiscal year. And as well, as hopefully some improvement in revenue rate entering Europe of the second half of this fiscal year. So we still are fairly confident that the design ends that we've been working on and the qualification and work that we're doing now, some of those products it's really in the second half of this current fiscal 2003 that we would expect to start seeing results from those products introductions and that business development activity. Analyst Great. Thank you, guys. Larry Sala - Anaren Microwave - President and CEO Yes. Operator Thank you, and our next question from call from Dale Pfau with CIBC world markets. Analyst Good afternoon. Larry Sala - Anaren Microwave - President and CEO Hey Dale. 9 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

AUGUST 06, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q4 2002 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call Joe Porcello - Anaren Microwave - VP of Finance Hey Dale. Analyst Could you tell us how you're doing with the drill line products? Also I wonder how you're doing with your new products, the isolator, Xinger product [inaudible]. Larry Sala - Anaren Microwave - President and CEO From a generalized standpoint we continue to capture new design waves, and in fact we currently are moving into final phase of prototyping and initial production on a couple of new adrenaLine design waves. From a revenue standpoint, though, we did see a drop off sequentially from the prior quarter or from prior run rates we're expecting to see it drop off due to some of a slow down in the 3G activity that we've seen for the last couple of quarters. We saw this past quarter and the prior, [inaudible] products given by 3G and we expect to see that decline for the next couple of quarters. But seeing some new design wins so from an acceptance of the product and the marketplace and design activity, we think it continues to be a strong contending product for us. In terms of the Xinger circulator with the initial product we introduced we continue to see some design in activity. We're trying to introduce over the course of the next couple of months 8 and 900 megahertz versions of that product to have a complete product offering to cover all frequency band. We're also trying to introduce a product that's to cover lower power, lower cost application. So we expect to continue to progress there. As far as actual contributions, current revenues, we're not really seeing any measurable contribution to our current revenues from our Xinger products. We still think that's probably a quarter or two away, Dale, before we could really get specific about dollars being generated by a product line. Analyst And then, Joe, if you said it I missed it in my handwriting, the percentage of revenue that was directly contributable to defense? Joe Porcello - Anaren Microwave - VP of Finance To defense? Larry Sala - Anaren Microwave - President and CEO Space, Dale, or - Analyst Just defense. It could be the space satellite for the defense department, that's fine, but not commercial space. 10 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

AUGUST 06, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q4 2002 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call Larry Sala - Anaren Microwave - President and CEO It was about a 50/50 split, Dale, last quarter between commercial and space. Defense about 3 1/2 of the 6 1/2 million. We really didn't have any defense based contribution. The space work that we did was commercial last quarter. So about 3 million commercial space, about 3 1/2 defense. Analyst And then just a little bit on trends out there, the fact that you're holding guidance kind of flat in a tough quarter and the quarter came in okay. Are you seeing - and of course you talked about your customers not giving you a whole lot of visibility. Are you seeing some customers move up, others move down? Are you seeing any significant shifts out there? Because it is kind of interesting that we're seeing most of the infrastructure guys under some pressure of one form or another. Larry Sala - Anaren Microwave - President and CEO Yeah, as I said, I think to a prior question, we haven't seen a dramatic shift, you know, over the last couple of quarters. Obviously over the last year we've seen appreciable drop off in our business at Motorola. We've gone from it being a 40 percent customer of our wireless at its peak to being more like a 10 percent customer the last couple of quarters. That all seems to be continuing. We haven't seen a big shift in demand or anyone picking up or losing share. So, you know, it's just a general across the board forecast, seems to be softening here. As I said, for us, you know, you have it with your [phonetic] businesses, it's cyclical, but this is always one of the more challenging quarters for us. Analyst Are there bright spots out there, are you picking up shares of power amplifier guys and are they holding on? What - if you had to, say, where are things looking the best, where do you feel best? Larry Sala - Anaren Microwave - President and CEO I guess some of the areas we feel best is the interest and acceptance of some of the new products that we introduced. We are continuing, we think, to pick up market shares, some of our complement products and mainly amplifier applications, and we are still seeing some customer assembly opportunities that are appreciable, with OEMs that we have not traditionally done a lot of custom business with. So it's not as though - we're not seeing development activity from an engineering standpoint, we're actually still very heavily loaded in both new components development activity and custom assembly, be it backplanes, standard custom and combining components or AdrenaLine products. In all of those areas we have, you know, what we think are credible, appreciable, opportunities that we're applying resources to. So from the engineering activity side we're quite positive, but we're, you know, continue to be concerned that we'll see production follow through in these opportunities. Analyst And one final question. That sort of relates to the some Celeritek issue. You've been primarily a passive company and always had an interest to move in the active direction. Is that a definitive direction or will you do specific applications on the passive side to round out your product family, and how aggressive do you expect to be on bringing active devices into the fold? 11 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

AUGUST 06, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q4 2002 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call Larry Sala - Anaren Microwave - President and CEO Well, I guess we've increased our activity on the partnering side and we'll be introducing over the next couple of quarters more that into our product line and doing that initially here through partnerships and moving products developed by ours. As we continue to pursue market opportunities and assess our ability to gain market share in this partnership type of arrangement, that will really be the bigger driver in our decision to either get more or less aggressive in trying to actually make acquisitions and control the active technology ourselves. But to date, we feel quite frankly that there is great benefit to combining our passive capability with an active technology. So we're continuing down both paths and trying to move forward as diligently and as credibly as we can. Analyst Great. Thanks, guys. Larry Sala - Anaren Microwave - President and CEO Thanks. Operator Thank you. Once again, if you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your touch tone phone now. Our next question we'll go to Arindam Basu with Morgan Stanley. Analyst How are you? Larry Sala - Anaren Microwave - President and CEO Great. Analyst Larry, you were commenting on some custom apps that the OEMs are able to garner some interest and acceptance. So is this what's referred to in the - when you talk about the initial qualification as wireless OEMs out of 5M? Larry Sala - Anaren Microwave - President and CEO No, I'm talking totally separate from 5M entering Europe. We're now calling it [inaudible]. That's a separate entity. It's solely focused around color amplifier, microwave, printed circuit assemblies, so that's an entity unto itself and something new for us and unique to 5M. So that's separate and that's what we're referring to in that press release. It was more responding to sales, specifically about generally where we see other bright spots and in that regard referring to our traditional capabilities and custom assemblies like backplanes, like custom splitting and combining components that we sell and AdrenaLine products which are often customized for our customers. 12 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

AUGUST 06, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q4 2002 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call And in all of those products as well we're seeing a relatively reasonable amount of demand and design activity that we're trying to service, and each one of those opportunities are, you know, appreciable opportunities on the surface. You know, our customers always come to us with relatively significant demand forecasts and so, you know, our concern, though, is whether the production quantities will actually follow, but from an engineering demand standpoint we're seeing a pretty positive outlook right now. Analyst Okay. And then out of Anaren Europe, the prototypes that were described, you said they were from amplifier and microwave assemblies. Can you give us some idea of platforms or technology? Larry Sala - Anaren Microwave - President and CEO It's pretty much across the board. I said that it's the product line that in any given application typically are looking at $30 to $75 of content in a power amplifier and it's really not for us an issue of any particular technology. I would say the one inherent difference in the selling process at Anaren Europe and that product line versus anything else that we sell is there is a much higher opportunity to get design into an existing opportunity as Anaren Europe and that technology as there is with any of our other products. So somebody asked if we were actively pursuing our additional sorts in an ongoing production opportunity and others are new development that have to go through their development cycle before they reach some production stage. So there's some more earlier opportunities to get production going with Anaren Europe's product line because they can be designed into current production opportunities. Analyst Okay. And then you talked about the 802.11 a bit before. Obviously with this market you're reluctant to talk about contribution in fiscal '03, but can you give us a sense in your long term planning even if you want to get near fiscal '04 what your gut feel is on revenue contributions from 802.11 amps from longer term. Larry Sala - Anaren Microwave - President and CEO You know, I don't think we're really prepared to give that guidance right now. I think by next quarter we'll be in a better position to start to articulate exactly what we think our contribution can be from that market. By next quarter we'll hopefully have publicly introduced a few specific products which will allow us to talk about the price point and potential volumes on that we see. We're just not ready to be able to articulate right now. Analyst Okay. And you commented your sample the [inaudible] manufacturers and you're going to have ten new components before the end of the year. Are each of the manufacturers looking at multiple products? Are those more custom kind of configuration based on the way the system is laid out? Probably just to clarify, when I say ten products I'm speaking to ten products for wireless applications, be it wireless infrastructure or other Xinger products for base stations and amplifier applications as well as several products for 802.11 applications. So I'm talking about ten products across the wireless markets that we're trying to address. But for the 802.11 application, we're talking about a family of, you know, maybe three to six products currently to provide the features and performance aspects of different customers are looking for, so we're hoping to have a reasonable level of standardization in our product line, but there are some variations that we're providing to better serve the given, you know, features of certain chips that manufacturers over another. So it's more of a Xinger type of product, I guess, in general, that we try to standardize. We try to standardize footprints and performance as much as we can so that we can produce in volume standard products. 13 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

AUGUST 06, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q4 2002 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call Analyst Okay. And then last question, on the space and defense side your operating margins and space and defense have GAAPed up steady each of the last four quarters. I want to get a sense for that in the June quarter and also talk about the new contract that a fixed cost or excuse me, fixed price account where you'd be able to go in with the lower cost structure and garner the types of operating margin they have been able to generate in that business over the last several quarters. Larry Sala - Anaren Microwave - President and CEO Joe can talk to the historical margin of the quarter. Just from the specific contract, I'll take that piece of it. Everything we do is a six-part contract, and this one is as well. We have bid and won to date the development portion of this fixed price account contract and if we're successful there, we're given an opportunity to bid on production by - on this contract which I said will bring a total opportunity to us of $10 million. We try across our business to achieve the - historically what we believe is our business model, 40 percent gross margin, 20 percent operating margin. This is a government contract. We're audited. We often struggle to get that 20 percent kind of operating margin from the government but we'll, you know, try our best to get a reasonable margin and the difficult part is more actually executing to the margin that we negotiate but this is no different than any other military job that we would pursue. Joe Porcello - Anaren Microwave - VP of Finance Historically over the last couple of years we've had a lot of commercial business running through the space and defense group over there. We've been able to obtain some very good margins and we've also slimmed the group down quite a bit. The volume of business is we're enjoying a little deficiency. We haven't had to buy a lot of equipment in that area and we've been fortunate that we've been able to execute contracts. Going forward, as Larry said, some of these will be newer business, so maybe we'll see a little fall-off in margins there, but we still have a very highly productive group of people back there right now. Larry Sala - Anaren Microwave - President and CEO And we expect the revenue rate in that group to sustain or grow somewhat this year over last. See, we're hoping to do that as efficiently as we can, trying to control our cost get a little more revenue. Analyst Thanks very much, guys. Appreciate it. Operator Thanks. Our next question will come from Mike Walke [phonetic] with RBC Capital Markets. Analyst This is Cliff Maldinado [phonetic] for Mike Walke [phonetic]. I just wanted to get an update on the China progress, see if you're going to initiate function for this quarter. 14 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

AUGUST 06, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q4 2002 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call Larry Sala - Anaren Microwave - President and CEO We're expecting to indicate production late this quarter. We hope to be in full-scale production by next quarter, everything is moving along to pace. Our general manager has been in place since the first of July. We have made several hires. We have our sales manager in place over there. And we're starting to move equipment, production equipment over there as well. So there's two what we feel are significant opportunities for us. One is the source some material from suppliers in China and in Asia in general. We initiated that activity which we believe will help mitigate some of the costs that we've been incurring over the last couple of quarters and then to initiate manufacturing there. We still plan to have both these activities going by the end of this quarter and by the end of the year, to be calendar year here, to have, you know, a significant production activity ongoing there. Analyst Great. And then will it be possible to get the split of the wireless component business versus the higher level backplane percent? Larry Sala - Anaren Microwave - President and CEO Yeah, typically, you know, have seen about a 50/50 split between our component activities and custom assemblies. And just to clarify, we would call custom assemblies more than just backplanes. Backplanes have typically done been of the big drivers, but a lot of our AdrenaLine product falls into our custom assembly business, and we have what we call splitting the combing components in our custom - in our custom business. So traditionally it's been more like 50/50. Over the last couple of quarters, it's trended to be more like 70 percent component - 60 percent component activity, 40 custom activity would be accurate. Analyst Okay. Great. And then did I mishear the customer mix? Did Lucent drop off and Nortel sequentially come on? Larry Sala - Anaren Microwave - President and CEO Yes, that's correct. Nortel was 5 percent of sales. The real reason behind Lucent dropping off, we have this quarter now we disclosed what was Celion [phonetic] as another customer for us now which would have been combined as Lucent in prior quarters for us. So we may have been a little late in making that change. But if we had combined the two together, Lucent would still be about the same size customer as they've been historically. I think they've typically been about an 8 percent, maybe sometimes 10 percent customer. Lucent by themselves is only about half of that or less typically so they're a 3 to 5 percent customer on their own. Analyst I see. Larry Sala - Anaren Microwave - President and CEO So they've dropped off and I would expect over the next couple of quarters we'll start reporting Andrew now that we're starting Soller [phonetic] as part of Andrew. No big change in our business. Just the fact that they have sold off that group. 15 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Larry Sala - Anaren Microwave - President and CEO Thank you. Operator Thank you. And as a final reminder, if you'd like to ask a question, please press star one on your phone now. We'll take our next follow-up question from Mark McKechnie. Analyst Hi, Joe. On the tax rate, you said what, 23 to 25 percent for September. Is that going to continue for the whole fiscal year of '03? Joe Porcello - Anaren Microwave - VP of Finance If the fiscal year falls out as we expect right now, yes. Analyst Got you. I mean, if is that a reasonable assumption, you know, for long term fully tax rate or - Joe Porcello - Anaren Microwave - VP of Finance We've got in terms of research credits, housing, look at the foreign subsidiaries. There's going to be a lot of things. Obviously we have the Chinese subsidiary now. We get a tax holiday over there so we start making some money. Then we get a further tax holiday for I believe about three years once we do start making money where we won't have to pay taxes. So I think the rate we're going to have to take a look at it may be every six months and let you know. Analyst Okay. That's fair. And then this China facility, are you seeing expenses from that already or should we - Larry Sala - Anaren Microwave - President and CEO Yeah, we've had expenses from China since probably the middle of the fourth quarter. We've had our general manager in place over there since July 1. He's been onboard here since maybe the beginning of May. So I think we're going to ramp up employees now. We have three or four at this point over there. We should have probably another six to ten by the end of the first quarter and then maybe production will depend on how we move production over there. Analyst Got you. Okay. And the timing of that production, again, you said was - 16 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

SEPTEMBER 23, 2002 / 2:30PM, IBKC - IBERIABANK Announces Merger With Acadiana Bancshares, Inc. Daryl Byrd - IBERIABANK Corporation - President and Chief Executive Officer John, thank you very much and good morning, folks. As outlined in our press release, we are pleased to announced our signing of a definitive agreement to acquire Acadiana Bancshares, Inc., the parent of LBA Savings Bank. This merger represents, we think, the marrying of two of this region's oldest -- and although I'm pretty bias -- I believe Acadiana's the most respected financial institution. I have known their CEO, Jerry Reaux, for almost 15 -- folks, frankly getting way too close to 20 years -- having worked closely with him when we were colleagues at First Commerce (ph) . And I respect his accomplishments, leading Acadiana Bancshares over the last seven years. We believe Jerry's management philosophy and the culture he has promoted are consistent with our relationship philosophy in paying attention to meeting client needs. We are excited to have an opportunity to serve the historically of this fine institution. We intend to focus on making sure we continue to earn their loyalty each and every day. As I believe most of you are aware, this is the first acquisition of this management team since joining IBERIABANK just over three years ago. Up until recently, we held a core belief that we needed to prove to our shareholders that we could consistently apply sound fundamentals and grow the franchise organically. Hopefully, our continuously improving performance over the last 10 quarters has earned your respect relative to our ability to be disciplined, balancing growth watchful eye on expenses for our growing revenues. Now, as we turn to another chapter in the development of this franchise, we know you'll be watching to see if we carry out this initiative in the same thoughtful manner. We believe this to be a fairly priced transaction for both groups of shareholders. And we are pleased to have the Acadiana shareholders become IBERIABANK shareholders. In particular, we believe this have been with them for many years and expect that many of these same clients acquired their share of Acadia Bancshares at their IPO (ph) , thus representing truly loyal shareholders with an interest in our community and a local institution's well being. We also believe that this combination is uniquely low risk and provides IBERIABANK a significant opportunity to improve our distribution system in Lafayette (ph) and New Iberia (ph) . As John will describe, we clearly will be able to have better coverage in each of these markets, and we'll be significantly more efficient in this coverage. Also, as John describes the transaction, we hope you'll note our realism relative to the opportunities presented. Again, we do have a good deal of confidence in our ability to produce an accretive transaction either through cost savings or income obtained through our expanded product capability. We are also very conscious of the importance of client retention. Given the in-market (ph) nature of this transaction, the combination significantly improves our already solid number two market share position in the Lafayette (ph) or Acadiana marketplace following Bank One. We currently have - and these numbers are as of June 30, 2001 - a 10.4 percent market share, and they have about a 4.9 percent share. So on a combined basis, our market position is 15.3 percent. The next closes competitor in Acadiana is Hybernia (ph) , with a 5.9 percent share and seven branches. Clearly, we will have a commanding position in Acadiana. Given this team's acquisition experience prior to joining IBERIABANK, we uniquely value and understand the balance necessary to achieve cost savings, while still maintaining client relationships that are usually people-based. I would remind you that much of the expense saving we have historically achieved in this core franchise was achieved not by layoffs but by attrition. We intend that cost savings, which must be achieved, will be achieved with a focus on maintaining client relationships. Not to establish false expectations, but Acadiana Bancshares has approximately 80 employees, and we consistently have 10 to 20 open positions given our much larger size. This dynamic will ease the transition significantly. 3 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

SEPTEMBER 23, 2002 / 2:30PM, IBKC - IBERIABANK Announces Merger With Acadiana Bancshares, Inc. Finally, all in all, this should be an excellent opportunity to significantly enhance our franchise and Acadiana. In doing so, build value for both groups of shareholders. John, I'll now ask you to go through the details of the transaction. John Davis - IBERIABANK Corporation - Senior Executive Vice President Thanks, Daryl. Let me begin by stating that we're excited about the merger announced today. We believe the merger's a win-win situation for all constituents of both organizations. I'll start my discussion with a few comments regarding the background of Acadiana Bankcshares, Inc. and it's primary subsidiary, LBA Savings Bank. Second, I'll describe the particulars of the deal followed by some price ratios and finally, comments regarding the risks and opportunities associated with the merger. It's pretty rare to find two cross-town financial institutions with corporate headquarters in the same town joining forces after both companies have been competitors for over 100 years. While the two companies are in different stages of development, both companies have been on relatively similar paths, moving from mutual thrifts (ph) to being competitive full-service commercial banks. This merger will only accelerate that process. LBA's lineage dates back to the organization's founding as a building and loan association in February, 1900 in Lafayette, Louisiana. The bank converted to a savings bank charter in August of 1993. The holding company was formed in February of '96, and an IPO was completed in July of 1996. The company went public at $12 per share. Since the IPO, Acadiana has been aggressively repurchasing shares of its common stock and according to the most recent public filings, the company's ESOP accounts for seventeen-and-a-half percent of the 1.1 million shares outstanding. The company estimates that broadly defined insiders in aggregate control about half of the total shares outstanding. Institutions hold a relatively small 16 percent of shares outstanding. By comparison, our institutional ownership is extremely large, totaling north of 50 percent. This merger will serve to move us in the direction of our goal of diversifying our holders into more retail hands. This is very positive, particularly when considering the vast majority of Acadiana's retail shares are focused in our surrounding five-parish Acadiana market. At June 30, 2002, Acadiana's assets totaled 313 million with $211 million in deposits and $28 million in equity with no intangibles on their books. As Michael (ph) will describe in a minute, the company had exceptionally clean asset quality focusing on mortgage loans historically and booking generally well-underwritten commercial and consumer loans. Mortgage loans account for about 57 percent of total loans and CDs account for 69 percent of total deposits. The company reported a tier-one leverage ratio of approximately 8.8 percent and total risk-based capital of 15.9 and book value per share of $23.77 at June 30. For the quarter completed June 30, 2002, the company reported a margin of 3.19 percent, an ROA of 77 basis points, an ROE of 8.74, and an efficiency ratio of nearly 70 percent. The company reported approximately 1.1 million fully diluted shares outstanding during the second quarter of this year. The fully diluted EPS was 52 cents in the second quarter of 2002. In general, we find the company's interest rate risk position to be fairly well balanced, with some risk to falling or stable rates. We find the company appears to be well positioned if rates were to increase, particularly in the near-term. LBA has an excellent set of branches to compliment our branch structure. The bank purchased a 136,000 square foot 12-story main office in downtown Lafayette in May of 2000. The bank currently occupies less than a third of the building and the property is well leased. Including the main office, the bank has four offices in Lafayette and one office in New Iberia. Six of our branches are within a mile-and-a-half of Acadiana's branches. We anticipate folding our distribution systems together with no net add to the current number of branches we have in the Acadiana region. While we have not made any final decisions regarding the branches -- which branches in particular will be closed -- we have a good idea of a probable consolidation plan. That's a very quick overview of the company. Next we'll turn our attention to the deal. Our merger proposal targets a value to Acadiana shareholders at $39.38 per share -- that's per Acadiana share -- when IBERIABANK Corporation's common stock trades within the fairly wideband of $34.00 to $46.00 per share or about approximately 15 percent in each direction. 4 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

SEPTEMBER 23, 2002 / 2:30PM, IBKC - IBERIABANK Announces Merger With Acadiana Bancshares, Inc. As a reference point, we have recently been trading in the recently narrow range of say $38.50 to $40.00 per share. Therefore, the value to Acadiana shareholders is fixed and the exchange ratio floats within the fairly wide band. At the targeted price of $39.38, the deal equates to 166 percent of book value per share -- that being book value per share of $23.77 at June 30, 2002. And the same 166 percent multiple of tangible books. The price multiple of trailing 12 months EPS is 19.2. The deposit premium is 11.5 percent and the premium over current market is approximately 66 percent. Acadiana shareholders will have more than tripled their money since the IPO in July of '96. And by reference, our shareholders have quadrupled since their IPO in 1995. The consideration in this transaction is 20 percent cash and 80 percent common stock. That means $7.88 per share in cash and $31.50 per share in stock subject to certain adjustments. No corporate board seats are being granted associated with this deal and a one year consulting contract is being provided to the President and CEO. While we're hopeful for a year-end close, in all likelihood, the deal will be consummated in the first quarter of 2002. We have granted a walk away if our price falls below $30.00 a share and we have received a walk away if Acadiana's deposits decline by more than 15 percent. We do not anticipate significant runoff from this transaction nor do we expect a $30.00 IBERIABANK stock price by consummation. Regarding our projections, we anticipate Acadiana's base earnings to be approximately 2.2 million in 2003. Our current estimates of one time charges is somewhere in the range of $5 to $6 million. We expect our estimate of merger-related charges will firm up as the deal progresses. Subject to further core deposit analysis, we estimate a five percent core deposit level with a seven year life amortized using an accelerated method. Our mark to market calculations are not complete at this time so the figures we're providing today exclude any impact of those marks. Our analysis indicates synergies equal to about 50 percent of current costs and we feel that that is appropriate for this transaction. At this stage we will not provide any details as to the composition of those projected savings. Using the consensus street estimate of $3.27 per share for IBERIABANK for 2003, we forecast accretion in the neighborhood of one to two percent on our fully diluted EPS, excluding any merger related charges. On a similar basis, we forecast three to four percent accretion to cash EPS. The internal rate of return on the deal is in the mid to high teens. As many of you may recall, we have built up our capital position significantly since the new management came on board three years ago. With a tier one leverage ratio of 7.59 percent, we're more than 100 basis points above our targeted range of six and a quarter to six and a half. This acquisition will cause our tier one leverage ratio to be reduced by about 70 basis points to a still healthy 6.89 percent. Our share repurchase program remains intact. To date, we have repurchased 77,100 shares of the 300,000 shares currently authorized under the December 17, 2001 program. We had an average cost of $38.68 per share. As a side note regarding capital, today we announced a significant increase in our quarterly dividend from 18 cents per share to 20 cents per share, or an 11 percent increase payable to shareholders of record on October 4. We also announced today that we anticipate releasing our third quarter earnings at the close of business on Friday, October 18. The following Monday - that being October 21 - we will hold a conference call at 8:00 AM Central Time to discuss our financial results. Please mark that on your calendars accordingly. We believe the opportunities for this merger are very favorable. We can fix some holes and significantly improve our distribution system in the Acadiana region. We anticipate a material amount of personnel synergies can be achieved through natural attrition. We've demonstrated we're very good at that. Acadiana's client base is consistent with our retail client base. Acadiana'a excellent asset quality limits any downside risk in the respect of credit quality. 5 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

SEPTEMBER 23, 2002 / 2:30PM, IBKC - IBERIABANK Announces Merger With Acadiana Bancshares, Inc. While there may exist some interest rate risk and risks associated with the positive runoff, we consider these risks to be fairly manageable. Given the significant experience this management team has in merger completions, we anticipate a smooth assimilation process. Therefore, we believe merger execution risk is manageable as well. Overall, we consider this merger to be a relatively low risk deal. In summary, again, we're very excited about this merger. We believe the pricing on the transaction is fair to the shareholders of both companies. We welcome the shareholders, employees and clients of Acadiana Bancshares into the IBERIABANK family. And we consider the prospects for growth of our combined entity to be exceptionally strong. I'll now turn it over to Michael, who will provide a few comments regarding asset quality. Michael Brown - IBERIABANK Corporation - Senior Executive Vice President Thanks, John. From a credit perspective, LBA's loan portfolio matches up nicely with that of IBERIABANK. It is solely focused on the Acadiana region, which is obviously IBERIABANK's home market. As John noted, the majority of LBA's loan portfolio is made up of residential mortgages, with the balance made up of commercial and consumer loans. I'll give you a sense of what the combination would look like. Based on 6/30/02 numbers, the combined companies would have recorded total loans of about $1.2 billion. The distribution of those would have been 27 percent residential mortgage; commercial, which is real estate; and then operating businesses 37 percent; and then the remainder would be in consumer, at 36 percent. LBA's credit quality has historically been very good, and this is reflected in their excellent historical performance in the merged companies' combined numbers. Historically, LBA has reported minimal charge-offs and limited non-performing assets. Again, to give you a sense to the merged entity, as of 6/30/02, the combined banks would have recorded annualized net charge-offs of 44 basis points and an allowance of 1.18 percent of loans. Non-performing assets would have been 51 basis points of total assets, which would have been covered 1.6 times by the allowance. Non-performing loans would have been covered 3.7 times by the allowance, and combined past-dues would be in a very low 64 basis points. I'll turn it over to Daryl for some concluding remarks. Daryl Byrd - IBERIABANK Corporation - President and Chief Executive Officer Michael, thank you. We believe this merger ultimately will form a very formidable competitor in Acadiana. And, again, as John mentioned, we view this transaction as uniquely low risk. At this point, I'll turn it over to everybody for questions. And we'll open up the conference call for questions - Erica (ph) ? 6 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

SEPTEMBER 23, 2002 / 2:30PM, IBKC - IBERIABANK Announces Merger With Acadiana Bancshares, Inc. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Operator Thank you. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. If anyone in our audience does have a question, please press star, one on your touch-tone telephone. Once again, that is star, one to ask a question. And we'll pause for just a moment. And our first question comes from Steve Covington with Stifel Nicolaus. Steve Covington - Stifel Nicolaus Good morning and congratulations. Unidentified Participant Morning, Steve. Unidentified Participant Thanks, Steve. Steve Covington - Stifel Nicolaus John, I know - I know you indicated you're not going to go into detail on the synergies, but just a very general question is, "Does the - do synergies include revenue enhancements?" John Davis - IBERIABANK Corporation - Senior Executive Vice President No, it does not. Steve Covington - Stifel Nicolaus OK, so those are all expense synergies. John Davis - IBERIABANK Corporation - Senior Executive Vice President That's correct. Steve Covington - Stifel Nicolaus Has due diligence been completed? 7 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

SEPTEMBER 23, 2002 / 2:30PM, IBKC - IBERIABANK Announces Merger With Acadiana Bancshares, Inc. John Davis - IBERIABANK Corporation - Senior Executive Vice President Yes, it has. Steve Covington - Stifel Nicolaus OK. And what is the current plan with the building that Acadiana purchased in 2000? Are you going to keep that? John Davis - IBERIABANK Corporation - Senior Executive Vice President Well, Steve, we'll very likely keep that building. I suspect I'll have my office in that building ultimately, and that'll probably be our headquarters long-term. Steve Covington - Stifel Nicolaus OK. Thanks very much. Looks like a nice deal. Unidentified Participant Thanks, Steve. John Davis - IBERIABANK Corporation - Senior Executive Vice President Thank you, Steve. Operator And our next question comes from Ross Haberman (ph) with Haberman Brothers (ph) . Ross Haberman - Haberman Brothers gentlemen, how are you? Unidentified Participant Fine, Ross (ph) . How are you doing this morning? Ross Haberman - Haberman Brothers Could you talk a little bit about Acadiana's cost of funds? And I - you just touched upon - I think you implied that they were positively GAAPed and how pro - you know, pro forma, how that is going to match up in terms of - how does that compare to your cost of funds today? And what kind of runoff are you expecting over the next year, and if - from their deposits, assuming you combine a couple of the branches? 8 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

SEPTEMBER 23, 2002 / 2:30PM, IBKC - IBERIABANK Announces Merger With Acadiana Bancshares, Inc. Unidentified Participant John will - John will handle that one. John? John Davis - IBERIABANK Corporation - Senior Executive Vice President OK, yes, first let me talk to the cost of funds. Generally speaking, Ross (ph) , the prices that Acadiana's paying on their deposits are very similar to ours. They have gone through repricing of their CDs as we have, so I would suggest you've got fairly similar cost of funds on the deposit side. They have some long-term federal home loan bank advances which are obviously of a higher rate than our overnight funding sources, so ... Ross Haberman - Haberman Brothers Will you pay those down and take the hit? John Davis - IBERIABANK Corporation - Senior Executive Vice President We haven't - we haven't worked through the particulars of that just yet. Ross Haberman - Haberman Brothers OK. OK. John Davis - IBERIABANK Corporation - Senior Executive Vice President We have some ideas - I'll say that, but I'm - beyond that, we're not going to say. Ross Haberman - Haberman Brothers OK. And ... John Davis - IBERIABANK Corporation - Senior Executive Vice President Let me - let me finish the rest of your question, if that's OK. The GAAP position - what we're suggesting is that it's not a pure GAAP analysis as much as it is through their net interest income simulations that how they behave and their earning stream behaves with changes in rates is generally they're positioned in such a way that we feel like they would be very favorably affected by an increase in rates, generally speaking. But again, we all know that rates don't move in tandem by same amounts simultaneously. Regarding the runoff expectations, while we do expect some runoff, we expect it to be fairly minimal in this transaction. Other questions, Ross (ph) ? I'm sorry. Ross Haberman - Haberman Brothers OK. No, that's it. Thank you. 9 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Gary Tenner - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey John, I have two questions. Actually, the first one you may have already noted. Could you tell us what the expected annual intangible expense will be added from this transaction? I think I may have missed it when you said it. John Davis - IBERIABANK Corporation - Senior Executive Vice President No, we haven't disclosed that. Gary Tenner - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey OK. John Davis - IBERIABANK Corporation - Senior Executive Vice President And we anticipate, obviously, we would not have goodwill amortization except to the extent of impairment. Gary Tenner - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Right. John Davis - IBERIABANK Corporation - Senior Executive Vice President But we have core deposits estimated at about five percent. We're running seven year average life and an accelerated method. 10 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

SEPTEMBER 23, 2002 / 2:30PM, IBKC - IBERIABANK Announces Merger With Acadiana Bancshares, Inc. Gary Tenner - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey OK. And secondly, could you talk just briefly about the -- I guess the quality of the commercial loan officers and the quality (ph) officers at Acadiana relative to you guys? And also, when you talk about an approved network with, you know, I guess with the idea of no net additional branches, how the network will change relative to how it is right now? Daryl Byrd - IBERIABANK Corporation - President and Chief Executive Officer Jerry (ph) , this is Daryl. We feel pretty good about their people. Michael just went through the credit quality information ... Gary Tenner - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Sure. Daryl Byrd - IBERIABANK Corporation - President and Chief Executive Officer And it looks like their portfolio is very clean. And it's likely we would have expected that. As I mentioned at the outset, Jerry and I worked together at First Commerce for a number of years and so we have a pretty high degree of comfort with their culture. And we do see the integration as very favorable with our franchise from a distribution perspective. Michael, do you have any other comments? Michael Brown - IBERIABANK Corporation - Senior Executive Vice President As Daryl said, we went through a very lengthy due diligence process as it related to the loan portfolio and we feel comfortable that we have hands around it. And as Daryl said, the bank has a long history of strong asset quality performance. John Davis - IBERIABANK Corporation - Senior Executive Vice President Regarding the franchise and distribution system, they have some excellent branches and we feel like there will be an excellent fit between our organization and our distribution system and theirs. And we are not disclosing nor have we completed that process of determining which branches will be consolidated into which. But we would suggest, given the fact we have six branches within a mile and a half of all of their branches that there obviously are some consolidation savings possible here. Gary Tenner - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey OK, thank you. Daryl Byrd - IBERIABANK Corporation - President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Jerry (ph) . Operator And once again, if you do have a question, please press star one on your phone. And we'll take our next question from Peyton Green with MidWest Research. 11 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

SEPTEMBER 23, 2002 / 2:30PM, IBKC - IBERIABANK Announces Merger With Acadiana Bancshares, Inc. Peyton Green - MidWest Research Good morning. A couple of questions. On the consolidation issue, if you close in the first quarter, how likely are you to have all the branches consolidated by the end of next year? And in your assumption on the accretion, is it particularly back end loaded or can you give us any color on that? Daryl Byrd - IBERIABANK Corporation - President and Chief Executive Officer John, you want to start with that I'll . John Davis - IBERIABANK Corporation - Senior Executive Vice President Yes. Peyton, I would suggest that part of the timing here is a function of regulatory approvals. And given the current environment, as we all know, it's somewhat unpredictable exactly when all that's going to take place. So we're somewhat a slave to whatever happens in that respect. We do anticipate that we have certain branch dispositions that will take place certainly before the end of next year, given certain lease elements that we're dealing with. But again, we anticipate that we'll be able to move pretty quickly with getting the cost savings once the transaction is completed. Also, we will be dealing with -- as we talked about -- we're able to extract cost savings through natural attrition that takes place and that requires quite a bit of planning. And fortunately or unfortunately, I guess, is if the deal's delayed for any regulatory issue then we certainly have time to work through those as well. Peyton Green - MidWest Research OK. And what is the nature of repricing on the home loan bank advances that you referenced? John Davis - IBERIABANK Corporation - Senior Executive Vice President Well, we're not in a position to disclose that now. Peyton Green - MidWest Research OK. And then what's the nature of the five to six million in one time items? John Davis - IBERIABANK Corporation - Senior Executive Vice President We're not going through that in detail at this stage. And again, keep in mind, some of that does require further review of their company and personnel and branch disposition issues and things of that nature that just have not been worked out. So we're providing what we see as being a range -- a very reasonable range -- of where we think we'll end up. Daryl Byrd - IBERIABANK Corporation - President and Chief Executive Officer I feel like we're being pretty conservative and pretty disciplined in that regard. 12 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

SEPTEMBER 23, 2002 / 2:30PM, IBKC - IBERIABANK Announces Merger With Acadiana Bancshares, Inc. Peyton Green - MidWest Research OK. And I noticed that you all have been more active with the buyback. But is there any particular - I mean will you increase the buyback to - if the stock - I mean this market is off to another great start today. Will you be more aggressive with the buyback or not necessarily so? Unidentified Participant Our buyback was announced December 17 of last year. And generally we're completing them within a one-year period. Obviously, given this transaction, there will be certain times when we will have to be out of the market. So we have realistically three months to complete it, recognizing certain timeframes we will not be in the market. So that's kind of where we are at this stage. But we're about 26 percent complete . Peyton Green - MidWest Research OK. I just didn't know if it would be reasonable to expect you all to maybe buy back some more stock given that you're going to issue in the transaction. Unidentified Participant The share repurchase program remains out there. And, again, our purpose of our share repurchase program all along has been to kind of sop up the excess equity that's generated every quarter, as we have grown the earnings stream fairly rapidly during this period. But the balance sheet has not grown significantly and we're still kicking off excess equity. Peyton Green - MidWest Research OK. And then just one last thing. From a qualitative standpoint, you all have done a great job of changing the mix on the deposit side of the balance sheet. What is the opportunity long term with Acadiana? Unidentified Participant We still think there are some opportunities there. And that's just because we're probably a much more mature version of an organization that has gone from mutual thrift to full fledged commercial bank. And as the clients of Acadiana come to know our product sets and our people and, we get to know theirs as well, then we can move forward and probably further develop that. Unidentified Participant Peyton, we're very excited about the expanded product sets that we bring to the table. And, again, both our institutions have long story histories in Acadiana. And we think they have a very, very little . Peyton Green - MidWest Research Sure - no, absolutely. Now are there any product consolidation issues that might cause some trouble? Like were they doing something, you know, very differently than you all would do that might cause some issues when you consolidate their product list to yours? 13 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

SEPTEMBER 23, 2002 / 2:30PM, IBKC - IBERIABANK Announces Merger With Acadiana Bancshares, Inc. Unidentified Participant No. Unidentified Participant No, Peyton. Not what we've seen, no. Peyton Green - MidWest Research OK, great. Thank you very much. Unidentified Participant Thanks, Peyton. Operator And, once again, if anyone does have a question, please signal by pressing star, one. And we have another question from Scot Valentin with Friedman, Billings, Ramsey. Scot Valentin - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey Good morning, gentlemen. Unidentified Participant Good morning, Scot. Scot Valentin - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey Question - and it was just by - someone else asked the same question, but as far as the synergies go, do you see it being lumped in earlier in the period of - assuming you closed first quarter of '03, would it be earlier than '03 to get most of the cost saves or it's going to be pretty stable across the year? John Davis - IBERIABANK Corporation - Senior Executive Vice President Scot, this is John. It's hard for us to predict exactly when it's going to - I would suggest we will be able to get some cost savings pretty quickly, but some of that's a question of attrition, contractual obligations, what happens with the facilities and all of that. And that's really fairly difficult to predict at this stage. But, again, we will be working pretty aggressively to getting the cost savings as quickly as we can. Unidentified Participant Scot, we want to be very methodical, as we always are, and very thoughtful in this process, understanding that client retention is huge. And getting the people side right is absolutely critical. 14 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

SEPTEMBER 23, 2002 / 2:30PM, IBKC - IBERIABANK Announces Merger With Acadiana Bancshares, Inc. Scot Valentin - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey OK. And then I guess someone else addressed the balance sheet mix going forward, but one thing I would point to is IBERIA's margin right now is running about I guess 458 as of last quarter. Unidentified Participant That's right. Scot Valentin - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey And Acadiana is about 318. So do you see a lot of pickup in the accretion coming from the margin shift over time? I assume, you know, Acadiana's margin will go more towards yours? Unidentified Participant At this stage, Scot, we're not factoring in a substantial change in the mix nor margin of that organization. We think there is room for some improvement in that respect, but as what we've indicated is we anticipate in 2003 that they could earn - excuse me - approximately 2.2 million. Scot Valentin - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey OK. John Davis - IBERIABANK Corporation - Senior Executive Vice President So it would not be a significant pickup to get those results. Scot Valentin - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey OK, great. Thanks a lot. Operator And we have a follow-up question from Ross Haberman (ph) with Haberman Brothers (ph) . Just one moment. Ross Haberman - Haberman Brothers How are you? Just a follow-up - John (ph) , could you address when you're going to transfer over their data processing system to yours? Unidentified Participant Ross (ph) , that's challenging for us at this stage to give a prediction in that respect, so ... 15 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

SEPTEMBER 23, 2002 / 2:30PM, IBKC - IBERIABANK Announces Merger With Acadiana Bancshares, Inc. Ross Haberman - Haberman Brothers Are they on the same system as you or different or what? Unidentified Participant they outsource. Ross Haberman - Haberman Brothers They do. So, you haven't had that set yet? Unidentified Participant No, it's actually a little premature for us to make that call exactly how that's going to work out because we haven't had any conversations with the data processing provider yet. Ross Haberman - Haberman Brothers OK. You threw out the accretion I think you said one to two percent on GAAP numbers in '03 - three to four (ph) in cash. Will there be more in '04? Have you put any numbers to that? Unidentified Participant We're not disclosing expectations for 2004, but again there's nothing materially different that you can expect in 2003 versus 2004. The issue comes down to being able to grow that franchise at the same rate or faster than we're growing our core franchise. That's an important element. Ross Haberman - Haberman Brothers And could the accretion be more than this one-to-two or three-to-four than you're saying because, again, I think you touched upon you're not including revenue enhancements? And what are the - are the - are the possible opportunities there? Unidentified Participant I will say that our current projections are one to two percent on fully diluted EPS and as we've described on the cash, so ... Daryl Byrd - IBERIABANK Corporation - President and Chief Executive Officer And Ross (ph) , ... Daryl again - I would remind you, as I said in my comments, we would expect that you all have watched us in terms of our discipline kind of a methodical approach over the last several years, and we're sure you'll be watching us to see how we perform in this one. Ross Haberman - Haberman Brothers Without a doubt. The best of luck. Thanks again. 16 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

SEPTEMBER 23, 2002 / 2:30PM, IBKC - IBERIABANK Announces Merger With Acadiana Bancshares, Inc. Daryl Byrd - IBERIABANK Corporation - President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator And we have another question from Bain Slak (ph) with KBW (ph) . Bain Slak - KBW Hi. Most of my questions were answered. I just wanted to get a brief - see if you could give a little color on specifically the Acadiana markets since, you know - obviously with this deal, you all are changing the competitive landscape a little bit. If you could just touch on the economy - sort of what you're seeing in terms of long growth (ph) and demand in the market, both you and Acadiana Bancshares, and again, the competitive landscape and how this changes it and what you see going forward. Daryl Byrd - IBERIABANK Corporation - President and Chief Executive Officer Bain (ph) , it's Daryl, and I'll ask Michael (ph) to kind of jump in from a credit perspective if he would like. Bain (ph) , it's consistent with the conversations that we've had historically relative to Acadiana. We're very, very positive on this marketplace. Feel like we have a very, very strong economy. Oil and gas has been sort of temperate over the last year, so although you've got pricing that's up now which we would suspect is more Iraqui-oriented, but we feel pretty good about the local market and have felt great about our ability to grow this market. We feel very good about the advisory boards we've put in place and their excitement and involvement in helping in this market. So, you know, again, we feel - we feel very positive, and I think if you talked to Jerry Reaux, he'd tell you the same thing. Michael, any comments from a credit perspective? Michael Brown - IBERIABANK Corporation - Senior Executive Vice President I'd echo Daryl's comments about the economic health here in Acadiana. It's been very stable to growing over the past 12 months, and from a credit quality perspective, the portfolio reflects that. Bain Slak - KBW OK, great. And I guess from a competitive landscape, you talked about quickly one in Hybernia (ph) . Outside of that, with this deal being done, who is the largest local competitor in this league? Unidentified Participant I'll let John answer that. He's got some information . John Davis - IBERIABANK Corporation - Senior Executive Vice President Yeah. Just taking a look at the Lafayette (ph) MSA (ph) , per information from FDIC, Bank One is the largest player in the market, with about a 19 percent market share. We are currently holding about 10.4 percent. Acadiana is the number seven player, with just under five percent. 17 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

SEPTEMBER 23, 2002 / 2:30PM, IBKC - IBERIABANK Announces Merger With Acadiana Bancshares, Inc. So we'll be moving from about 10.4 up to about 15.3, with $647 million in deposits. So we will be a very strong number two. The number three player, which would be the closest behind us, would be Hybernia (ph) , at just under six percent. So it's a substantial step down for that third level. Bain Slak - KBW OK. And then any - OK. And I was wondering about any local - are there any local Acadiana players left that's come up in the radar? John Davis - IBERIABANK Corporation - Senior Executive Vice President Are you talking from an acquisition side or are you talking from... Unidentified Participant Just market share. Unidentified Participant Just market share, John. John Davis - IBERIABANK Corporation - Senior Executive Vice President Oh, in the market share. Home Bank (ph) is at 5.6 percent, Mid South's (ph) at 5.5 percent. Bain Slak - KBW Great, thanks. Unidentified Participant , again, as I indicated in my closing remarks, we think we'll be a very formidable competitor. And obviously - and, again, my remarks included this - the numbers we're quoting are as of June 2001... Bain Slak - KBW Right. Unidentified Participant ... and at that time - I'll say this in kind of as kind of a way as I can - you had a good bit of change in market shares and we felt pretty good about our growth in market share. It will be interesting to see what the numbers will look like when the '02 numbers come out. You know that's all delayed. Bain Slak - KBW Right. Right, thanks. It looks like a good deal. 18 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

SEPTEMBER 23, 2002 / 2:30PM, IBKC - IBERIABANK Announces Merger With Acadiana Bancshares, Inc. Unidentified Participant Thank you. Operator And we have a follow-up question from Peyton Green with MidWest Research. Peyton Green - MidWest Research Hi. Just one follow-up on kind of the interest rate risk of Arcadiana going forward. You all have done a great job at getting, you know, all (ph) whittled down, but they have a fair amount of exposure there. And as the back end of the yield curve comes down, have you all factored in any risks from them getting prepays on the asset side? John Davis - IBERIABANK Corporation - Senior Executive Vice President Yes we have, Peyton. And we've taken a good hard look at that situation. And that is a risk element that does exist, and it's one that they've been facing for some time. So it's really a question of that franchise, and we recognize kind of their circumstances accordingly. Peyton Green - MidWest Research So have you all kind of modeled a negative loan growth type assumption over the next two, three quarters? John Davis - IBERIABANK Corporation - Senior Executive Vice President We'll disclose what our modeling looks like, so I really can't tell you much beyond that. Unidentified Participant But we understand. John Davis - IBERIABANK Corporation - Senior Executive Vice President We understand the risks. Peyton Green - MidWest Research OK, thanks. Unidentified Participant Thank you. 19 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

In the first quarter for the financial services, which was the worst quarter really for the industry since the crash of the equity markets in 1987, E*Trade grew through both net revenue and ongoing profitability quarter over quarter and year over year. At 12 cents per share from ongoing operations this marks our ninth consecutive quarter of ongoing profitability. We continue to improve 2 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

OCTOBER 16, 2002 / 9:00PM, ETFC.OQ^J20 - Q3 2002 E*TRADE Earnings Conference Call operating leverage, produce strong mortgage origination volume and profitability, drive innovation with the use of new technology, prudently improve net interest rate spread at the bank, generate positive cash flow, maintain a strong balance sheet, and realize success in our cross-sell and up sell efforts. Now, our discipline focus on profitably creating value for our customers has allowed us to decrease our earnings from ongoing operations from break even in our first quarter 2001 to 12 cents per share from ongoing operations this quarter or $443(ph) million from ongoing operations on $330 million on net revenue. On a GAAP basis, we have improved earnings from a net loss for $9 million or negative 3 cents per share to net income of $21 million, or 6 cents per share over the same period. One of the key factors in our improved profitability has been our ability to effectively leverage the inherent strength in our diversified financial services model. As our investors have moved money from bottled equity markets to fixed income securities, driving mortgage rates to historic lows, our model has allowed us to offset declining brokerage revenues with increasing banking revenues. When the equity markets began to fall at the end of quarter one of 2000, our net banking revenues totaled $29 million. This last quarter, our net banking revenues derived from our banking, lending, and asset management activities totaled $120 million. This represents more than a four-fold growth in revenue largely offsetting the decline of net brokerage revenue over the same period. Specifically, as equity markets continue to decline in February of 2001, we took the necessary steps to further diversify our offerings through the acquisition of our direct to consumer mortgage origination business. We saw the value in originating mortgages as the prudent way to improve investment yield to the bank and to assume more control over the flow of mortgage volume. We also saw the benefits of adding a product line that had appeal to our customers. At the time, we projected total origination volume for 2001 to equal about $1 billion. However, our mortgage business originated over $5 billion in loans last year, exceeding all expectations. In 2002, we predicted volume to abate over time in line with an expected increase in interest rates. Instead, we generated $4 billion (ph) in new mortgage volume year-to-date, including over $1.6 billion (ph) in third quarter as interest rates have plummeted to 30-year lows. We're also experiencing similar growth in the correspondence side of our mortgage business, and were recently recognized by Inside Mortgage Finance as one of the top 15 U.S. correspondent and jumbo producers in 2002. This is the first time that E*Trade financial has appeared in these rankings demonstrating the expanding presence of our correspondence mortgage business over the past two years. We recognize that at some point in the future, interest rates with will rise, mortgage volumes will decline and investors will return to the equity market. Accordingly, our focus has been leveraging the infrastructure of our brokerage business in order to maximize revenue and profitability. We have lowered our break-even point for retail brokerage by 7% to 65,000 transactions per day, and we continue to introduce new products and integrate new business segments quickly for market making onside traditional trading. In our second quarter, we implemented a simplified $9.99 flat commission rate program for our most active trader segment. As a result, we have seen a growth in market share as demonstrated by a 6% increase in both activity and account in our most active trader segment. In response to this success, we recently announced the extension of this program to any customer averaging nine or more trades per month for a total of 27 or more trades per quarter. Now, the new program encourages customers to enhance their trading by the power of nine and includes a flat commission of $9.99 per stock trade in an industry leading 9 second trade execution guarantee expected at the end of the month on qualified stock trades. Through this expanded service, we reinforced our position as a leader in on-line active trading services and advanced our strategy to increase market share, revenue, and profitability while delivering low cost, high value services to our customers. The company also improved profitability by leveraging the relationships between each of its business segments. While other market makers have struggled to the effect of decimalization and declining volumes, our market maker, Dempsey and Co., has benefited over the past nine months from increased internal order flow now at approximately 50%. We have done so while maintaining the best execution for our customers and separately adding our nine-second guarantee. Further, we have profitably expanded Dempsey's business into the Boston and UK exchanges resulting in a greater percentage of listed and over-the-counter market share volume. Our institutional business continues to gain market share and is making progress in rolling out electronic trading platform utilizing our route x technology. This platform currently allows our institutional customers electronic access to markets in the U.S., Germany, and Canada. We expect to add the UK, Netherlands and France around the first of the year. In addition to opening up different markets for our institutional clients, route x technology also enables internal cost savings of about $2 million annually. We also continue to see success in our cross-sell and up sell activities particularly for our mortgage-related products. For the quarter, we saw 28% of demand for our mortgage products come from current account holders and in fact, 53% of our home equity products were sold to existing 3 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

In a period where the NASDAQ saw decline of 20%, the Dow and the S&P indices experienced comparable declines. We saw total assets in our customers decline only by 11% during the quarter in comparison to these proxies, indicating net cash inflow after adjustments for market losses. We continue to expand our media and content effort across the U.S., enabling us to further extend positive perception of E-Trade financial and expand brand awareness in a very cost efficient manner. We generated approximately 6 million media impressions per month last quarter through initiatives such as broadcasting over 14 minutes of market coverage live from our San Francisco center to Bay area television viewers in a single day. In a mid-quarter on-line survey, 92% of E*Trade financial customers said that they viewed E*Trade financial content as credible as or more credible than content of other financial news and information providers, a big step for us in this direction. In addition, our profitability is enhanced by our ability to lower expenses by successfully executing on our efficiencies initiatives by eliminating, while eliminating unnecessary redundancies and integrating complimentary services while adding to our value proposition through innovation, technology, and pricing power. Since first quarter 2001, we have delivered over $200 million in operating efficiency savings after adjusting for acquisitions. We also continue to benefit from a flexible cost structure in these challenging times. By being nimble, we have been able to implement effective efficiency initiatives without that kind of wholesale layoff that others in our industry have suffered. Indeed, we believe it's our discipline and deliberate approach to staffing throughout the full economic cycle and our ability to quickly adapt to changes in economic opportunities that have allowed us to continue to grow both revenue and profit. We'll continue to be diligent, prudent, and targeted with respect to sizing our division according to their ever-changing business requirements and environment. As we mentioned last quarter, which is really exciting for us, the company has taken an industry-leading position in the deployment of low cost limit(ph) systems as well as other industry leading technological advancement in network, management, network architecture and data cashing. The result in reduction in systems cost is $12 million a year. The use of resource management tools and automation has allowed the call centers to adjust costs rapidly to meet changing market conditions. The call center costs have been reduced 12% last quarter and 32% the same quarter a year ago saving an estimated $18 million this year with a corresponding increase in customer satisfaction of 6 percentage points over the quarter as validated by an independent, outside firm. While we have significantly reduced cost expenses, we also improved the speed of execution service. Website performance improved during the quarter as a result of optimizing site performance, networking and deployment of limit(ph)servers. The brokerage website speed as measured by Keynote improved 19% from last quarter and 25% over the same quarter last year. In addition, site reliability has remained above 99%. A five-percentage point improvement over a year ago, the dot com implosion has neither impaired nor invalidated the internet as a cost effective distribution channel as well as an actual(ph) information and transactional platform for financial services and that really is a key information point going forward. Our systems have won numerous recognition, including Best in the Web for 2002, a discount brokerage category by Institutional Investor, the 18th in I.T. innovation which was critical in Information Week's ranking of 500 top companies and Para(ph) E-Trade ranked number one by Hyperactive Trading in second quarter of 2002. The result of our effort is that every business unit at E*Trade financial is profitable. In that promise, we expect our international retail operation, part of our brokerage unit to break even of run rate by the end of the year. Beyond our ongoing profitability and efficiency initiatives, we continue to acknowledge, appraise and proactively appraise our risks across our lines of business. We also continue to evaluate our processes and procedures and make appropriate changes when necessary. As a result, we average -- we revisited our reserve policies and strengthened reserves at the bank, important to note not out of a need to address any pending issue but to protect the company from unexpected events beyond our control. Len will speak more on this subject in a few minutes. As you can see, the E*Trade financial story is one of growth, profitability, as we continue to expand brand loyalty and add value as well as improve our product offering and exploit the leverage inherent and across the lines of business and capitalize on new opportunities all by focusing on the needs of our retail, corporate and institutional customers. We're really excited to hear more details about our performance and future plans with you, and we will be hosting an analyst day on Thursday, February 20th, 2003 on the New York Stock Exchange. My team will be joining me in presenting our strategies and tactics for 2003; more details about this event will be available from the Investor Relations group in the next three days. I would like to turn it over to Len to go through the numbers. Len Purkis - E-Trade - CFO Thanks, Christos. Net revenue of $330 million, up 4% quarter over quarter and up 13% year over year. Further, we were able to drop more of this revenue to the bottom line, delivering earnings from ongoing operations of $43 million, and that's an 11% increase quarter over quarter and a 4 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

OCTOBER 16, 2002 / 9:00PM, ETFC.OQ^J20 - Q3 2002 E*TRADE Earnings Conference Call 364% increase year over year. During the quarter, we reached 7.5 million shares at an average price of $3.78 per share. This brings the total shares we purchased to 48 million shares with 9 million shares still available throughout our organization. Consistent with our guidance, we were $16 million cash flow positive for the quarter prior to $28 million in share re-purchases, prior to raising $18 million for equipment financing. We exited the quarter with $341 million in free cash, and that's up from $335 million in last quarter. We expect to remain cash flow positive through the fourth quarter. We continue to diversify the bank's asset portfolio by expanding our consumer loan portfolio as well as home equity loans and lines of credit while maintaining our focus on credit quality. As a result, net charge-offs for the quarter were only 12 basis points of the total average assets and down four basis points from last quarter well below the provisions second quarter industry average of 19 basis points. Provision for loan losses for the quarter total $4 million. Credit quality of the portfolio remains strong. Weighted average FICA scores for our mortgage quarter portfolio helps firm 7.25 and 7.35, respectively. Mortgage portfolio remains geographically well diversified, comparison to the averages providing protection in the event of rolling recession. The weighted average loan-to-value ratio is less than 70%. Finally, our delinquencies remain flat QoverQ. Total assets are totaling 62 basis points for mortgages and 90 basis points for auto as measured through outstanding loans. So while historically our reserve policies have been adequate for our high credit quality mortgage loan portfolio, we realize that we reflect the risk as we diversify our assets. As a result, we assessed their loan loss reserve policy and consumer loan portfolio and will now maintain a level of reserve to cover a minimum of 12 months expected future losses, and that's up from six months previously. A reserve for our consumer loan portfolio now equals 61 basis points in the balances, and that's up from 29 basis points last quarter. Now, reserve for mortgages held remains unchanged at approximately 20 basis points. Our revenues in brokerage, brokerage revenue totaled $209 million for the quarter and down 3% for last quarter and up 8% over three quarters last year. This decrease quarter over quarter was related primarily in a slowdown due by the state of the economy. Improvement year over year is where acquisitions were seen. Commission revenue total $72 million, 1% increases over last quarter and last year. Crystal transactions totaled $52 million, up 1% over our second quarter and up 66% year over year. This increase over last year came from the acquisition to benefit our increased market share, particularly in July. As you will note in our press release metric table, we have revised the presentation of on-line and offsite transaction data to better present the transaction structures. We're reporting on site metric average of trades traded per day per quarter separate from our on-line business, which we will continue to report on a quarterly basis so the average daily transaction. The revenue we generate in this professional trading segment is based on per share pricing of the transaction. Daily shares traded for the quarter have averaged 43 million, down 24% of shares in June. This decline is related to a seasonal slowdown as well as the decision to eliminate certain trading replace ships that we determined to be unprofitable. The impact of this business decision was felt in the quarter, but we had a significant increase of professional trading equity the second half of the quarter. The global retail trading and daily transactions average 79,000, down 4% over last quarter, down from 13% year over year in line with anticipated and normal slowdowns reflecting the impact of the challenging macro economic conditions. The banking revenue, banking revenue increased to $128 million for the quarter and 19% increase of last quarter's revenue and 23% increase over the quarter last year. We continue to experience strong mortgage product, and no interest fee income, specifically gain on loans held for sale and other securities and other bank-related revenue was up 34% over last quarter and up 23% for the same quarter last year. We continue to see improvement in net interest income totaling $55 million, an increase of 3% over last quarter and 33% increase over the same quarter last year. This increase came as a result to further diversify our loan portfolio with higher interest earning assets by lowering rates. We will be exiting this year and add on the 200 basis point run rate by winding back interest rate spreads to 152 basis points an 8 basis point increase over last quarter and 47 basis point increase over same quarter last year. Finding assets in the market place and making our spread requirements and credit card proved difficult last quarter. Our efforts to widen our spread also impeded like everyone else in the industry by mortgage refinancing in the bank's portfolio. Interest rate environment that helped our mortgage business part reduced our spread over the quarter. We're on plan for acquisitions to be effective and significantly increase net interest spread without compromising quality. As a result, you will note that we have shifted a portion of the bank's portfolio held for sale in anticipation of these acquisitions in the fourth quarter. Additionally, this allowed us to rebalance the reserves of our consumer portfolio consistent with our policy. Our mortgage products remain strong with our mortgage business generating $1.6 billion in new origination. We ended up with a billion locked in the pipe. This brings our total origination mortgage volume to over $4 billion for the year on track with last year's record volume. The company experienced similar growth in the current funded side of the mortgage business producing 1.2 billion in the third quarter. On the expense side through the ongoing and successful implementation of efficiency initiatives, we approved that gross margin to $184 million. This represents an increase of needing $2 million or 1% improvement quarter over 5 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

OCTOBER 16, 2002 / 9:00PM, ETFC.OQ^J20 - Q3 2002 E*TRADE Earnings Conference Call quarter and 21% improvement over same quarter last year. Ongoing operating expenses for the quarter totaled $106 million, down $9 million over the prior quarter and down $21 million in the same quarter of last year. Through the past year, we have been able to lower technology development and general and administrative costs as we eliminated unnecessary redundancy's and consolidated operations. In regard to selling and marketing, we prudently lowered expenditures by focusing on brand distribution, harvesting our existing customer base. For the earliest in the company, net income from ongoing operations expanded to $43 million, generating earnings per share from ongoing operations at 12 cents per share. This represents an 11% increase over last quarter and a 364% increase over same quarter last year. With guidance, we're comfortable with the street consensus of 14 cents earnings per share for ongoing operations for the quarter. We have consistently delivered on our guidance despite worse than anticipated markets and the uncertainty in the macro global arena. Our challenge in this environment is to continue to grow our diversified revenue streams and further improve operating efficiencies allowing us to sequentially increase earnings per share from ongoing operations in the fourth quarter. In conclusion, the improvements in our financial performance over the past 12 months validate the strength of our brand, quality of our service and the benefits of our diversified business model. Our 2001 third quarter results included earnings per share of 3 cents from ongoing operations, just under $300 million in total revenue. This quarter, we generated a four-fold increase in earnings over third quarter last year as we have 12 cents per share of ongoing operations, 13% higher revenue. We're also pleased at the quality of our earnings remain solid and we expand our revenue sources and reduce our dependencies on any single source of income on any one line of business while strengthening our balance sheet through the generation. Now back to you. Christos Cotsakos - E-Trade - CEO Thanks Len. In August we published quarterly survey tracking customer attitudes about the economy, market and their own financial affairs. More than 1,800 customers participated discussing a diverse range of assets, trading levels, product ownership and service need. They expressed confidence of the markets over the long term and a commitment to maintaining a position in the equity market. In addition, more than 40% of our activity traders say they that they are actively moving money into the market through stocks and mutual funds. A majority of our customers indicated that real estate offers a superior investment motive than the stock market. While some of these appear obvious, the data arrives through the survey through our data warehouse and provides valuable insight into our customer needs, interests and their issues is our ability to focus on customers' views and concerns about the economy and their personal finances and to quickly respond to those changing needs that makes up an important part of the E*Trade group value proposition. By delivering product excellence at superior price with easy use and easy access, security and stability, we're able to support and add value to individuals managing their financial futures. In return, our flexibility and nimbleness allows to us build for long-term growth and revenue and earnings while adapt to an unpredicted market place to take advantage of opportunities. Despite these challenging times, opportunities do exist for revenue growth and profitability. In the brokerage business will focus on the trading segment and focus on our institution and corporate service businesses. Earlier this month, we began publishing our proprietary research for the benefit of our institutional clients and ultimately our retail clients as well. We also expect a positive response that we experienced last quarter from our limited 999 E*Trade pro-offer to grow over the coming quarter with the recent launch of our expansion of nine campaign. We will gain market share in the active trader market while also positioning ourselves with the leverage revenue as the markets recover. In banking, we're going to continue to enhance our product line and drive revenue with existed offering and finish home equity lines of credit and auto loans. The growing line of products and the diversified deposit base, we anticipate substantial and sustainable improvement in our industry spread. Drawing on the strength and experience of E*Trade global asset management, we had our first securitization as a manager in September. Going forward, we expect to expand our fee income and generate better economics for our mortgage and consumer loan offerings. Now, it's difficult to determine what the future holds in these challenging times. The financial markets continue to struggle and investor confidence continues to wane marked by political and economic uncertainties. We cannot predict the market environment, but we can control our destiny by staying focused on creating value for our customers and prudently managing risks while maintaining the highest standards of ethics and integrity. The management team and I believe the company is solidly positioned to sustain growth and future success. We now have the scale, the infrastructure, product, and diversified business model in place to profit economically during challenging times.

If at any point your question has been answered, you may remove yourself from the queue by pressing the pound key. Questions will be taken in the order they're received. Limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We do ask that while you pose your question; pick up the handset to provide optimum sound quality. Thank you. Our first question is coming from Glen Shore of Deutsche Bank. Glen Shore - Deutsche Bank - Analyst Hello, all, just one question. Christos Cotsakos - E-Trade - CEO We can barely hear you. Glen Shore - Deutsche Bank - Analyst How is this? Better? Christos Cotsakos - E-Trade - CEO A little better. Glen Shore - Deutsche Bank - Analyst Okay. I guess the question revolving around the bank asset portfolio, and I want to revisit some of the earlier comments. So I was interested if the total assets came down, and I thought you were actually building out the auto piece, and that came down 250 or so million, was that a sale of an auto piece, and did that not fit or the spread get to a point where it was a good sale? What I'm focusing on is the 152 basis points. Is it still a good to get to 200, or is it look, let's manage toward profitability, and we'll get as close as we can with doing the right thing on the credit side? Christos Cotsakos - E-Trade - CEO The first thing is not to compromise credit quality whatsoever and get it as close possible. 7 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

OCTOBER 16, 2002 / 9:00PM, ETFC.OQ^J20 - Q3 2002 E*TRADE Earnings Conference Call Len Purkis - E-Trade - CFO I think what I said in the script is what we've experienced in the third quarter is that in this environment, we want to make sure that we keep that focus on the credit quality and not just go for the 2000 basis points, and sacrificing that. We repositioned the balance sheet at the end of September to enable us to make more diversification plays in the balance sheet and widen the spread, but, again, we're being very choosy about what we're doing there in terms of everything we're doing. On the order of loan portfolio, I will let (inaudible) answer the detail about it. Mitch Caplan - E-Trade - President Just to talk about it a little bit broader. You know, we are committed to getting to our spread target, but as both Christos and Len said, we're looking at that, but at no point will we focus sacrifice our focus on credit quality. As an integral part to getting to our spread, 200 basis point run rate exiting 2002, it's important that we make room on our balance sheet for the new type of consumer finance assets that we are going to be putting on the balance sheet, and as a result, we sold certain assets in anticipation of what we were going to do in Q4. Accounting rules require that you move them from held for investment to hold for sale in the quarter before, and that's exactly what we did. Glen Shore - Deutsche Bank - Analyst Maybe it would help me understand. Can you disclose what equity was at the bank? In other words, was it around $800 million or so? Len Purkis - E-Trade - CFO Yeah, just under 800. Christos Cotsakos - E-Trade - CEO Let me jump in for a minute here. To answer your specific question about auto, there were no sales of auto last quarter. What we experienced with respect to the auto portfolio is very much what we experienced in the mortgage portfolio, which is significant pre-payment, so to the extent that you see a decline in auto, we're not reversing our strategy in any way. We intend to continue advancing it. You know, you're fighting this trend line of pre-payment that you see both in mortgage and auto. Len Purkis - E-Trade - CFO We're just being prudent. Glen Shore - Deutsche Bank - Analyst I totally understand. Let me ask you on something. I think this is something that will be on the minds of many people, and I think we had this conversation the last time -- Christos Cotsakos - E-Trade - CEO Can you talk a little louder, Glen. You're fading out. 8 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

OCTOBER 16, 2002 / 9:00PM, ETFC.OQ^J20 - Q3 2002 E*TRADE Earnings Conference Call Glen Shore - Deutsche Bank - Analyst Absolutely. I think this is along the same lines of the originated loan. This is something that I think is on a lot of people's minds. Gain on sales and gains on loans held for sale had a spike-up much like they did, I think, back in the fourth quarter. Help us understand. Is there a cost side to this component, or is this all revenue that actually flows right to the bottom line? Len Purkis - E-Trade - CFO There's definitely a cost side, and you know, this is -- if you look at the first line item, it's our mortgage business and there's customer service there, and there's a very high customer service there which we gained back by having a lower operating source and we have a good operating margin there, and on the other line item, there's definitely costs down there, part of which, again is in services, but, again, we have a fairly high administrative cost there, which gets us to we look -- gets us to looking at these businesses both as being net income generators and not as net revenue generators . . .. Christos Cotsakos - E-Trade - CEO Glen, to put that in context, there's two different numbers. The first one is the gain on sale of origination mortgages. That's your direct consumer business. By way of example, starting off, we have 430 people in head count associated with that alone for cost of services. Then you have all of your additional opex expenses below the line, whether it's the marketing the tech, or generalized g & a, and the second line that you're seeing which is gain on sale of loans held for investment is our correspondent business. Again, that's the significant part of the 15th Floor, and you have correspondent sales business. All of the comp and benefits associated with it, as well as the tech and building it out and the marketing expenses. So, in fact, you would see both of them having very similar cost structures both in the cost of services and getting to the same gross margin as well as the same opex and getting to the same bottom line. This is the work of (inaudible) and significant amount of effort over the past two and a half and three years building out a mortgage business. Glen Shore - Deutsche Bank - Analyst That explains why the g & a, and cost of services lines is up sequentially? Christos Cotsakos - E-Trade - CEO That is exactly right, and they are directly related to those two lines of businesses. So in general head count was flat quarter over quarter, but up 240 or 245 in the two mortgage businesses, as we reengineered and reallocated among the business units. Mitch Caplan - E-Trade - President And, again, as we said about the environment that we've got and adding head count to those areas that are building revenue, building volume, and we're reengineering head count in those areas that are readapting for the changing environment. Glen Shore - Deutsche Bank - Analyst Super, just this question. You made money on both an operating and a GAAP basis. Why does equity decline sequentially in the quarter? Is that because of the FAS 133 is going through? Len Purkis - E-Trade - CFO You will see the premium on shares went down, which is the share buyback impact that we had. We have a couple of places where it's impacted. 9 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

OCTOBER 16, 2002 / 9:00PM, ETFC.OQ^J20 - Q3 2002 E*TRADE Earnings Conference Call Glen Shore - Deutsche Bank - Analyst Great. Thanks, guys. Len Purkis - E-Trade - CFO Thanks, Glen. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mike Vinciquerra from Raymond James. Mike Vinciquerra - Raymond James - Analyst One question I have on the loan portfolio is that you have higher prepayments on the mortgage and auto loans and they were there from third-party acquisitions. Are you having any write offs for acquisition premiums on those loans because of the accelerated pre-payments? Christos Cotsakos - E-Trade - CEO We've had a write off for that. Mike Vinciquerra - Raymond James - Analyst You didn't pay any premiums when you acquired those loans in the first place? Christos Cotsakos - E-Trade - CEO No. Mike Vinciquerra - Raymond James - Analyst Then, could you give us some color on the origination of the correspondent loans, I'm curious as to who your partners are how you developed that piece of business. In the correspondents area, it's my understanding it's, number one, price sensitive, or number two, long-term relationships that you've had with various originators throughout the country. Christos Cotsakos - E-Trade - CEO We've been work on that business for quite a long time. In the past before the bank actually got into origination of mortgages, itself, and bought the retail mortgage channel, correspondent business is really what we had, so we've been working on that line of business for over 10 years. During that period of time, we developed quite a number of relationships with different sellers throughout the country. We have a sales force that makes relationships, that maintains relationships. Within the past year, we more than doubled our number of sellers, which, for us, is something that we believe is helping us not only currently, but it will help us when the interest rate environment goes up and volumes slow down. At least we will have a broad of people who are continuing to sell us mortgages over time. So we really do have a very broad, diverse base of sellers to us, and in fact, we have very little reliance on any single seller or small group of sellers or in any particular part of the country. 10 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

OCTOBER 16, 2002 / 9:00PM, ETFC.OQ^J20 - Q3 2002 E*TRADE Earnings Conference Call Mike Vinciquerra - Raymond James - Analyst Very good. That's helpful. Can you also give us an idea on the retail side of the mortgage business, what you're seeing in terms of mix between refinancings during the quarter versus purchase business, and I'm just trying to kind of line it up with what we're seeing in the industry? Mitch Caplan - E-Trade - President Yeah, I think that generally speaking, we're following the industry. I would say at this point in Q3, it was probably about 850% refinance, 15% purchase, as we reported last quarter, it was about two-thirds, one-third, but the quarter before when refinances were still strong, it was similar to the 85/15. You know, it really depends on what's going on in the marketplace, and we're seeing something similar. Mike Vinciquerra - Raymond James - Analyst I'm going to get in one more here, and then I will shut up. On your mortgage sales, you mentioned that you have done your first securitization yourself, are you guys holding any assets after that securitization in terms of servicing rights, or are you selling everything through credit risk servicing rights and so forth. Mitch Caplan - E-Trade - President Well, actually, what we did was, we didn't do a securitization of mortgages. What Christos referred to in the transaction done by our local asset management group was actually a sale of a CDO, collateralized debt obligation, and backed by asset-barked securities and mortgage-backed securities and not mortgages. You know, it's not that -- it's not a difficult type of mortgage security ideations. Christos Cotsakos - E-Trade - CEO That was our first go in that market. Mitch Caplan - E-Trade - President It was incredible. Mike Vinciquerra - Raymond James - Analyst Did you maintain any of the loss or the credit risk on any of those? Mitch Caplan - E-Trade - President : Yes. We maintained a very tiny piece of it. It was a deal of $250 million against which we have preference shares of $9.5 million, and just to speak to the quality of the deal, itself, those preference shares are of such high quality that they're rated investment grade, so we're holding them not because we have to but because we want to. Mike Vinciquerra - Raymond James - Analyst Okay. Thanks for all the details, guys. 11 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

OCTOBER 16, 2002 / 9:00PM, ETFC.OQ^J20 - Q3 2002 E*TRADE Earnings Conference Call Mitch Caplan - E-Trade - President Sure. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Adam Townsend of J.P. Morgan. Adam Townsend - JP Morgan - Analyst Good afternoon, guys. Can you provide any detail on the segment profitability at this point, or do we need to wait for the Q to come out for that? Len Purkis - E-Trade - CFO Well, the Q that comes out will give you segment profitability in a different accounting format. What you can see generally is that the brokerage was profitable in stand alone and corporate allocations merely from the fact that we lowered the break even point in brokerage down to 5,000 and we did 75,000 transactions, and you can go to the other end in the brokerage business. (Inaudible) And obviously bank that was profitable in stand-alone, as well. What we want to do in first quarter of next year and in the court of next year is get our segment pointing more in line so they will be showing bank and brokerage going down to bottom line profitability rather than what was assured in the K right now, which is more accounting. Christos Cotsakos - E-Trade - CEO That's just internally how we organize the new division structure that we put in place out a month ago, and we also expect E*Trade technologies to start delivering bottom line profits this year and - (inaudible) Adam Townsend - JP Morgan - Analyst Is it safe to assume that the institutional and global segment is still losing money, but you're approaching profitability by the end of the year? Is that still the goal? Mitch Caplan - E-Trade - President The answer to that is absolutely. The reason, as I'm sure you understand, the way we're present reporting it in the Q is that it shows institutional and international together, and the institutional business, both globally and specifically in the U.S., is profitable. To Christos' point is imminently clear on the call, and that is there's not a business segment that we're in now that we're not profitable with the exception of retail in Europe and retail in Asia, and again, we have given guidance at a break-even run rate exiting Q4. Christos Cotsakos - E-Trade - CEO Part of the Asian issue of the write off and the trades taken this quarter and we will exit the quarter at break even. 12 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

OCTOBER 16, 2002 / 9:00PM, ETFC.OQ^J20 - Q3 2002 E*TRADE Earnings Conference Call Adam Townsend - JP Morgan - Analyst Okay. Good color there. Let me ask about really account growth. You know, certainly, the environment is not, you know, very healthy for that, but it seems like there's been, you know, pretty tight contraction in terms of the growth rate there. Can you talk about what you are doing on the marketing front? What you are seeing in terms of trying to acquire accounts. Account acquisition costs seem to be creeping up a bit so we're not getting as much bang for the buck as we would like to see. Maybe some color there would be helpful. Mitch Caplan - E-Trade - President Part of that is an aberration for the quarter and part of that is we're targeting segment marketing and concentrating on the active trader brokering and we believe in this challenging market will be the most profitable segment, and that is where we gain 6% share in the active trader segment just over the last several weeks, and I believe some of our competitors will lose share in that area. That's where we're concentrating as well as in some of the areas that are growing with mortgage origination, and we're looking at some of the brand aspects and repositioning how do we spend and where we spend through the direct mail and targeted mail. Christos Cotsakos - E-Trade - CEO Also, as well, and I think you focused on it, what you will see is a gross in household access accounts, and a big part of that is we stepped back and looked at the behavior of our customers in the last quarter, and we recognized that there was an opportunity for us to pro-actively market them and say, listen, this is the best way to manage your cash, and you may want to put a couple accounts together and put it in this particular cash management account and it will generate the highest return for you, so as a result of our success and consolidation of accounts bringing up more households and therefore, more assets per household. Mitch Caplan - E-Trade - President Also, as a follow-on, Christos will tell you correctly we have spent a huge amount of time trying to take the existing customer base, data mine it, cross-sell it, and particularly, obviously around the mortgage area where we saw huge opportunities, so we have run a couple of direct campaigns which are not necessarily growing new accounts, but are bringing in mortgage loans and then which we resold into the secondary market, but clearly, we retain the marketing rights and will try to gain additional relationships with those customers who we originated mortgages for refinancing activity by way of advance. Christos Cotsakos - E-Trade - CEO I think the other thing is just consolidation of products is that we're really working on because advertising would be in any media to the brokerage area. (Inaudible) To that effect, the short term will have a higher look for acquisition space in how you spread the marketing funds, but our balance can be directly allocated and appropriately to those that are making us a higher-yielding profitability. Adam Townsend - JP Morgan - Analyst This is just a follow-up to that in the consolidation of accounts per Household, are you finding there's any sort of benefit from the cost of service standpoint and servicing fewer individual accounts, but, you know, more on households? Christos Cotsakos - E-Trade - CEO We have services to back off that Especially when you go bank to brokerage, you know, whether it's call center activity and we will increase productivity there and reduce costs, whether it's in consolidation of the website and how we integrate that, so for us, it's a huge productivity that is to double back on our profitability. 13 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

OCTOBER 16, 2002 / 9:00PM, ETFC.OQ^J20 - Q3 2002 E*TRADE Earnings Conference Call Adam Townsend - JP Morgan - Analyst Very good. Great, thank you, guys. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from Rich Repetto of Putman Levell. Rich Repetto - Putnam Lovell - Analyst Hi. You said you're comfortable with a 14-cent consensus estimate, and I guess a little bit of this goes to the mortgage-related revenue. I'm just wondering how much of a pipeline can you see, or how much of a view can you get due to the lag of the mortgage origination? I think on the call Len was pretty clear. We're entering the Q4 with a billion pipeline. Christos Cotsakos - E-Trade - CEO That's solidly locked. Rich Repetto - Putnam Lovell - Analyst Okay. Well, baked into the 14 cents, then what sort of trading assumptions is embedded to get you, you know, given that you got a billion dollar pipe line locked plus there's probably still some more room for growth there, too, if rates stay low. Len Purkis - E-Trade - CFO We're pretty much staying with where we've been all year, and that's flat to maybe down a little bit on the transaction. Christos Cotsakos - E-Trade - CEO You know, the whole issue with us is that we lowered the break even. You know, we're making assumptions that trading activity is remained flat and we're going to concentrate on those areas that will give us the biggest bang for our Buck. And as an active trader segment, gains for share, and I think that will give us some additional leverage, and we would look at that to offset any further declines in the market. Rich Repetto - Putnam Lovell - Analyst Okay. Next question, and this is going to be my last question is, you know, the stock-still trade at a significant discount to peers out there. I was wondering and I heard you announce the analyst day coming in February. Anything, you know, in between now and then that you think you're working toward to try to, you know, remove or sort of bring this discrepancy back in line with investors or, you know, is this something we are just going to focus in on other areas and sort of let it be and let it work itself out? Christos Cotsakos - E-Trade - CEO Two things and one, we really can't comment on the stock because there are so many things that are out of our control, and our view is concentrate on the fundamentals and work on building the franchise business that the company will get recognition for it and investor confidence will build as we go forward, so that's not primary. I think the analyst day will go a long way to make that an annual event. Len and Rob just came back from 14 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

OCTOBER 16, 2002 / 9:00PM, ETFC.OQ^J20 - Q3 2002 E*TRADE Earnings Conference Call a two-week trip in Europe, and be out on the road for several weeks talking to investors about where we are and where we are going and we think that we it will have a positive effect on the company. I think us continuing to pound out, you know, consecutive quarters of profitability in a market like this where our competitors are will get things in the balance with respect to where we are. Rich Repetto - Putnam Lovell - Analyst Okay. Len Purkis - E-Trade - CFO We're building a franchise. Rich Repetto - Putnam Lovell - Analyst Okay. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from Colin Clark of Salomon Smith Barney. Colin Clark - Salomon Smith Barney - Analyst Good afternoon. Can you provide us with a trades-cape revenues and expenses for the third quarter on a stand-alone basis? It looks like it's about $8.3 million. Len Purkis - E-Trade - CFO What we do is trades-cape we break it out in terms of metric table, but we don't break it out in terms of revenue and blend it into (inaudible) commission line (inaudible). Colin Clark - Salomon Smith Barney - Analyst Okay. Since we don't have too many data points on the professional trading trend, can you at least give us some insights on historical trends? In a weak environment, have volumes tended to be better in. Mitch Caplan - E-Trade - President Yeah. On the question on trading volumes, I mean, through the summer, they were a little weaker than we had originally anticipated. Part of that, though, was as was mentioned in the in the discussion at the beginning of the call. We went through as part of the integration to look at parts of the business that we wanted to emphasize and other parts of the business we want to de-emphasize, and we weeded out certain parts of the business that were less profitability, and you know, cut them out. What we've seen from probably mid-August and then increasing week by week and certainly continuing now is an increase back in volumes, back to more levels where we would expect. 15 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

OCTOBER 16, 2002 / 9:00PM, ETFC.OQ^J20 - Q3 2002 E*TRADE Earnings Conference Call Christos Cotsakos - E-Trade - CEO What we also found, though, with trades-cape, which is important, we found more integration opportunities or value than we originally expected. At the back office, we found that there's a lot we can do with integrating the back office and driving our clearing cost down. Mitch Caplan - E-Trade - President We found integration opportunities with our touch point strategies. We moved some of the trainers, for instance, into our center here in New York, and also on the technology side. The technology is quite good, and we're finding that it's got use outside of just the professional trader that we're also being able to leverage it in our other parts of the retail business, but also in the institutional business. In terms of the overall industry, any slowness that we experienced in the summer was experienced industry wide, and that actually, I believe, is benefit for us because part of our strategy there is consolidation, and we've got pricing power that the rest of the market doesn't have, and we've got staying power, obviously, that the rest of the market doesn't have, so any slowness, actually works to be a benefit for us in our continuing strategy. Christos Cotsakos - E-Trade - CEO You know, just as we learned more about the professional trading environment with the active trader and especially with some of the technology that goes along with that acquisition, we think that integration is going to work well for us in our new campaign coming out with 999. Other programs that we had, and we'll be able to give you more flavor as we get to two or three quarters and get a better handle on professionalizing the professional trader activity, which, before was just a hodgepodge of different franchises all over the U.S. And we will consolidate that and make that a viable business opportunity, and that's a great profit for us. Colin Clark - Salomon Smith Barney - Analyst Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from John Levin of J.P. Morgan. John Levin - JP Morgan - Analyst Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. Len, my questions relate to cash and cash flow. First, I'm wondering in the call you had mentioned that the free cash, I guess, at the parent company's 341, and I'm just trying to reconcile that versus is the consolidated cash number in the press release of 1757 and the cash and equivalence at the bank, which is 1194, the difference there is 563, so how would I reconcile the 341 versus 563? Len Purkis - E-Trade - CFO Cash and equivalence that we show on the balance sheet is 1.7 billion, and we look at cash segregated 924. Obviously, the segregated cash, we don't count. Included in the 1.7 billion is cash that is from regulated entity, so it's not really available on the group level, so we don't count that, so the 341 million is included in that 1.7 billion, and like we say, the other part is regulated. John Levin - JP Morgan - Analyst So the difference of about 222 then would be at brokerage entities or -- 16 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

OCTOBER 16, 2002 / 9:00PM, ETFC.OQ^J20 - Q3 2002 E*TRADE Earnings Conference Call Len Purkis - E-Trade - CFO It's a combination of traditional business, brokerage entities and the bank where that money is not really available. It's about 1.4 billion. John Levin - JP Morgan - Analyst Okay. Then for cash flow, the press release says that there's about 16 million of positive cash flow from operations before capital items. Can you just break that out into some detail, you know, a lot of us are used to looking at businesses and starting cash flow with EBITDA and seeing things like cash use for capital expenditures and cash used or generated by working capital changes and cash payments for interest and things like that. Can you just give some greater level of detail on the cash flow item? Len Purkis - E-Trade - CFO Well, the largest part of that it comes from operations and appreciation is running at 27 million a quarter. Our CAPEX was approximately $11 million in the quarter, and the other areas would be areas of working capital and investment in other areas like commitment to our venture partner, so we put out detail in the Q. It's a very forward cash analysis. We include everything in there, whether that's increased investments in brokerage or bank, capital requirements, which there aren't because they are well capitalized. Predominantly, it's coming from our operations and CAPEX. John Levin - JP Morgan - Analyst Okay. Thank you. Operator Thank you, and our last question of the day is coming from David March of Friedman Billing Ram. David March - Friedman Billing Ram - Analyst Hi, guys, yeah, the last caller asked several of my questions with regard to cash flow. But drilling down a little bit more, it seems to me that the bank must be cash flowing pretty well at this point. Have you dividend any cash from the bank up to the holding company level, and do you have any plans to do that at some point in the near future? Len Purkis - E-Trade - CFO We have excess capital at the bank. At the end of the third quarter, it's about $60 million, which we include in our free cash. At the moment, the bank, what we're anticipating going forward is going to be profitable, but we don't have to invest more capital into the bank unless we make the strategic decision to economically get some returns that we want to get out of the bank, so there's no immediate need for a dividend back. What we are looking at, first, obviously, is the bank to be successfully getting to a 200 basis point spread run rate, and then we can assess the other opportunities we can do to grow the balance sheet, and we need to get to that bar first. David March - Friedman Billing Ram - Analyst Okay, and you mentioned the money that you would be putting into the venture funds. Can you discuss how much, if any, went into venture funds in the third quarter, and how much more would be required to be put into that based on the contractual obligations that you have there? 17 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

OCTOBER 16, 2002 / 9:00PM, ETFC.OQ^J20 - Q3 2002 E*TRADE Earnings Conference Call Len Purkis - E-Trade - CFO There are a number of venture funds. The amounts that we committed in the third quarter were insignificant to our cash flow and the commitments that we had outstanding really don't compare when you look at our overall cash. It's just one of the items -- like I said, we included everything when we look at cash. David March - Friedman Billing Ram - Analyst Thanks. Len Purkis - E-Trade - CFO Thank you. Christos Cotsakos - E-Trade - CEO All right. Thanks, everybody. Have a great day. This concludes the call. Operator This concludes the E*Trade group third quarter earnings conference call.

Porcello Anaren Microwave Inc. - Vice President Finance CONFERENCE CALL PARTICIPANTS Rich Valera Needham and Company - Analyst Greg Patricia Banc of America Securities - Analyst Earl Wam CIBC World Markets - Analyst Cliff Odanodo RBC Capital Markets - Analyst Judson Couplin Morgan Stanley - Analyst Kevin Steedy Royals Fargo - Analyst Arindam Basu Analyst PRESENTATION Operator Anaren First Quarter Earnings Release. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for introduction and opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Larry Sala President and Chief Executive Officer of Anaren Microwave, Incorporated. Please go ahead, sir. Lawrence A. Sala - Anaren Microwave Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for participating in the Anaren Microwave Fiscal 2003 First Quarter Conference Call. I am Larry Sala, President and CEO and I'm joined today by Joe Porcello our Vice President of Finance. We are going to first provide an overview of the results of the first quarter, which ended September 30, 2002 after which Joe will review the financial highlights. We'll then take few questions. The statements contained in this conference call, which are not historical information are forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed. You're encouraged to review Anaren's first quarter press release, Anaren's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2002 and Anaren's Form 10-Q for the first quarter ended September 30, 2002 and the exhibits to those reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to learn more about the various risks and uncertainties facing Anaren's business and the potential impact in Anaren's net sales and earnings. Net sales for the first quarter were $20.4 million, up 36% from the first quarter of last year and down 5% sequentially from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. The operating loss for the quarter was $455,000 compared to operating income of $700,000 for the first quarter of last year and $361,000 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. The operating loss for the quarter included a $403,000 or 1 cent per diluted share restructuring charge or workforce reduction at Anaren Europe. This action was taken to align the workforce at Anaren Europe with the current level of demand and is expected to reduce operating expenses at that facility by approximately $1 million annually. The Anaren Europe qualification and designing activity with several leading wireless OEMs are progressing. The lack of visibility across the wireless market resuscitated the action. Net income for the first quarter was $146,000 or 1 cent per diluted share. Wireless business sales for the quarter was $13.1 million up 53.6% from the first quarter of last year, but down 12.3% sequentially from the fourth quarter. Sequential decline in net sales from the fourth quarter is the result of an overall decline in demand and not from any one product line or customer. New design activity for both the component and custom product remains strong and during the quarter we began to increasing demand for custom products to support cost reduction program on existing wireless infrastructure and amplifier projects.

OCTOBER 22, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q1 2003 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call e believe that our technology and product portfolio are very well suited for cost reduction application. Wireless group customer concentration for the quarter as a percentage of wireless group net sales was PowerWave at 19%, Ericsson at 14%, Motorola at 7%, and Lucent at 6%. During the quarter we introduced our first component product for the 2.4 GHz [inaudible] wireless networking access point and client application and began sampling select customers with 5.2 GHz products as well. We are very pleased with our progress in this rapidly growing market having already captured record design win with two leading chipset manufacturers. Our initial product a Balun transformer is used to convert single-ended signal into a balanced or differential signal to interface to the receive low [inaudible] amplifier and the transmit power amplifier. We believe that our product offers superior performance over traditional alternative, improving the range and [inaudible], while reducing the overall power consumption in total [inaudible]. For the Space and Defense group net sales for the first quarter was $7.3 million up 13% from the first quarter last year and up 12% sequentially from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. Space and Defense group new orders for the quarter were $5.2 million including a follow on order for missile receiver application. We are seeing strengthening domestic and international defense demand over the last 6 months for radar, [inaudible], and receiver application. And given the current demand we anticipate quarterly Defense group net Sales will continue to achieve $7 million. Space and Defense group backlog at September 30th 2002 was approximately $31.3 million. During the quarter we took action to reduce our operating costs at Anaren Europe in line of current wireless market condition. We will continue to diligently review our operations and detect the actions necessary to perform optimally in the current environment. Joe Porcello will now review the financial highlights. Joseph E. Porcello - Anaren Microwave Inc. - Vice President Finance The financial highlights of the first quarter income statements from the balance sheet of September 30th 2002 are as follows. The gross profit margin for the first quarter of the fiscal 2003 was 26.4%. This was a 2.6% point decrease from gross margins of 29% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. Gross margins fell on both wireless and Space and Defense products in Q1. Margins fell on wireless products due to decline in net sales and a higher proportion of lower margin products in shipment mix in Q1. Space and Defense margins fell due to a number of new programs in Q1, which currently have a higher level of engineering costs and a lower initial yields in the programs in the Q4 shipment mix. Going forward in current revenue levels and production shipment mixes. We do not expect to see any significant change in gross margin. Investment in research and development was 6.8% of net sales in the first quarter of 2003 compared to 8.2% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. Research and development expenditures declined slightly from quarter four levels due to the application of internal engineering to new customer funded Space and Defense programs. Loss from operations was 2.2% of net sales in the first quarter compared to income from operations of 1.7% in the fourth quarter of last year. Operating margins declined due to the drop in gross margins and the restructuring charges at our European facility. Without the restructuring charges, operating expenses fell at approximately $425,000 in Q1 compared to Q4 including a $360,000 decline in R&D expense in Q1 due to the shift to new funded transit engineering programs in the Space and Defense group. At this time the company is reviewing all opportunities to reduce cost and we'll continue to implement cost savings measured when and wherever possible with the goal of making all operations profitable. We presently do not expect significant improvement in operating income over first quarter 2003 levels prior to restructuring, without any increase in sales volume. Net income was 0.7% of net sales for the first quarter of 2003, as compared to 9.4% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, which included a tax benefit of 3.7% of net sales. On a per share basis, diluted earnings per share fort the first quarter of fiscal 2003 were 1 cent. This compares to 9 cents per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, which included a 4 cents per share tax benefit. The balance sheet highlights includes the following: Cash, cash equivalents, and investments were approximately 125 million in September 30th, 2002 and June 30th, 2002. We have continued to enjoy a positive cash flow from operations in the first quarter despite the lower level of net income. Cash generated by operations was approximately 2.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Accounts receivable were 12.5 million in September 30th down 600,000 from June 30th, 2002. Day sales outstanding at September 30th were 56 days unchanged from June 30th, 2002. We continued to expect day sales outstanding to fluctuate between 55 and 70 days as we go forward depending on sales level customer mix and business levels. Inventories this September 30th, 2002 were relatively unchanged from June 30th at 20.2 million. Capital equipment additions in the first quarter of 2003 amounted to approximately 2.1 million. The additions were mainly for automated material handling equipment in Anaren, Europe and 3 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

OCTOBER 22, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q1 2003 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call production equipment at our [inaudible] facility. Account sales [of] September 30th, 2002 were 4.8 million, down slightly from 5 million to June 30th, reflecting the small decline in business activities from the June quarter. During the first quarter we purchased 71,800 treasury shares in the open market at an average cost of $8.27. It is anticipated that we will continue to make open market purchases of shares for treasury under the current board authorization depending on market price. Lawrence A. Sala - Anaren Microwave Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks Joe. Joseph E. Porcello - Anaren Microwave Inc. - Vice President Finance As in previous quarter, visibility from our wireless customers remains very limited. Given the current level of market visibility we are projecting net sales for the second quarter to be in a range of $19-20 million and diluted earnings per share to be in the range of 1-2 cents. Before taking your questions and we also addressed our positions with respect to Celeritek. As you know on September 25th, Celeritek rejected around $8.75 per share cash offer claiming it was not in the best interest of Celeritek shareholders. Although we continue to believe in the merits of our business combination with Celeritek, given Celeritek projected revenue and profitability decline, we remain committed to the necessity of appropriate due diligence before we can further assess our valuation of Celeritek and our intent to consider all the alternatives available to it and may pursue one or more of the possible actions outlined in its 13B, section 13B filing as amended. Operator we'll now take questions. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Operator Thank you. The question and answer portion of today's call will be conducted electronically. If you would like to ask a question please do so by pressing the "*" key followed by the digit "1" on your touch-tone telephone. If your using a speakerphone, please make sure your mute option is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment, once again "*1" for questions. We'll pause for just a moment to gather our audience. We'll take our first call from Rich Valera with Needham & Company. Rich Valera - Needham and Company - Analyst Thank you, afternoon Lary and Joe. First question on the margin, Joe you mentioned in your comment that you didn't expect any improvement in the gross margin barring higher revenue levels or significant restructuring. I am just wondering why there might not be a mix shift back to higher margin products or a mix shift back to higher margin production products in the defense area? Why this sort of certainty that it will stay with this particular mix with a foreseeable future? Joseph E. Porcello - Anaren Microwave Inc. - Vice President Finance What we can see now in the second quarter shift index appears to be pretty comparable to the first quarter mix. So the model as it roles out appears to come up with approximately the same gross margins. Rich Valera - Needham and Company - Analyst Would you expect a longer term lets say the defense side at least with transition more to a higher margin production? 4 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

OCTOBER 22, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q1 2003 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call Joseph E. Porcello - Anaren Microwave Inc. - Vice President Finance Yeah, I think we'll see improvement over the long term as the volume picks up some of the newer products, the yield improved and the engineering begins to slow down a little bit. Rich Valera - Needham and Company - Analyst And you eluded to potential restructuring I guess. Is there anything more you can say and what you might do to get the margins up in the absence of the higher revenue levels? Joseph E. Porcello - Anaren Microwave Inc. - Vice President Finance Not at this point, that really depends on the market and where it goes over the next couple of months. Rich Valera - Needham and Company - Analyst Okay and Larry you mentioned that you lowered the annual OPEX in [entering] year-end by a million dollars. Can you say what the quarterly break-even level is there for 5M at this point? Lawrence A. Sala - Anaren Microwave Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer It appears to be somewhere around $2 million in net sales of quarter, that would get that operation close to break-even or [inaudible], but obviously its mix dependent there as well but given the business that we've seen and what we are pursuing its somewhere in that [2-2.25] million per quarter of net sales and that's our break-even now. Rich Valera - Needham and Company - Analyst And are you sort of in the 1.5 million range there now? Joseph E. Porcello - Anaren Microwave Inc. - Vice President Finance Not quite there but that's approaching that somewhere between 1 and 1.5 million is where the operation stands. Its been running the last 2-3 quarters. Rich Valera - Needham and Company - Analyst Okay and there is been some big contracts announced in China the last couple of days. Have you guys seen any kind of ordering from any of your major OEM customers in relation to that? Lawrence A. Sala - Anaren Microwave Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer [Yes today] any significant follow through with the result that the announcements to the last week or so, yes, but we wouldn't expect to see it that quickly and you know sometimes you know we see a little bit in advance and don't know exactly who the end markets for us, so tough for us to say we haven't seen any single event that's follow through from that yet. 5 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

OCTOBER 22, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q1 2003 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call Rich Valera - Needham and Company - Analyst And finally in the defense bookings, how does the defense bookings picture look over the next couple of quarters? Do you expect to built that up a little bit and bring that backlog up some? Lawrence A. Sala - Anaren Microwave Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer You know, we continue to say that the timing of orders in that business is very difficult to project, the things move quarter or two just with no real reason but overall over the next two quarters we would expect to have a positive book to bill ratio, book to bill ratio greater than one. But that timing can move, it's tougher business for us to predict timing in the near term. Rich Valera - Needham and Company - Analyst Great. Thank you. Lawrence A. Sala - Anaren Microwave Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Operator Our next question is from Arindam Basu. Please go ahead. Arindam Basu - Analyst Hi guys. How are you? Lawrence A. Sala - Anaren Microwave Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer Good. How are you? Arindam Basu - Analyst Good. On the [inaudible] products, could you talk about? I got the first one was a [bio line] transplant, I missed the second one, sorry Larry. Lawrence A. Sala - Anaren Microwave Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer No it's a [balanced] product is the only one we have announced today. Arindam Basu - Analyst Okay. 6 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

OCTOBER 22, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q1 2003 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call Lawrence A. Sala - Anaren Microwave Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer But its used in two places potentially. They can be used as a front-end [citing] a [receive] low noise amplifier where the advantages and enhancement and sensitivity and it can be used at the output, at the power trans -- power amplifier on the transmit side where the advantage is, you know, higher transmit power and lower overall power consumption due to its less [inaudible] insertion mask through our product than competing alternatives. So its one product that can be used in either or both places depending on the design architecture. Arindam Basu - Analyst Okay. I got it. And on the well, on the actual customer applications, what sense do you get in terms of these parts, of the position or being, are being designed for let us say [PCOEM] wins versus [inaudible] [card] to stand on access points, do you have any sense of that? Or is it simply because its on the [ICU] level, its too hard to tell? Lawrence A. Sala - Anaren Microwave Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer We have a little insight not a great deal across our whole customer base. We do know our first generation of products are being designed more into access points than into client applications. But we're developing product that we think will have broad applicability across every application. So we foresee over the next couple of quarters, participating across all applications, be it an access point or a client application, be it a PCMCA card application or other embedded solutions. Arindam Basu - Analyst Okay. And then the Joe some details on space and defense usually are, your choose and [Ks] talk about operating margins, do you have a sense of space in defense operating margins now and what it was space versus defense? Lawrence A. Sala - Anaren Microwave Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer No we normally don't disclose that. Arindam Basu - Analyst And then Larry you are talking about seeing some custom component [float-through] at the end of the quarter. And could you talk a little about custom versus standard wireless component operating margins and how those typically would vary? Lawrence A. Sala - Anaren Microwave Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer I'll show you product line by product line in our component group. In general, I would say today we see our component products in total be in comparable margins to our custom products, maybe a little stronger margins than our custom products. But if you average all our component products together, they are fairly comfortable. In the quarter, we saw the mix tend to be more standard products, which should be a component product, which is an area that we've focused more on over the last 9-months or so. But the design activity in the second half of the quarter, we are starting to see more activity on the custom side around cost reduction efforts on existing platforms. Whereas previously, for the last year or more, we saw the majority of custom design activities being on new third generation platforms. So we feel, we're seeing a real trend in the market place towards cost reduction activity and less activity focused on new platform development. For us, we think that means the potential for a nearer term revenue string from our development after expenses targeting existing platforms, and doesn't require new third generation deployment to generate revenue. 7 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

OCTOBER 22, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q1 2003 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call Arindam Basu - Analyst Okay that's good point, thanks. And Joe, could you go over the treasury stock numbers again? Just go with number of shares and average price? Joseph E. Porcello - Anaren Microwave Inc. - Vice President Finance We purchased 71,800 shares and the average cost was $8.27 a piece. Arindam Basu - Analyst Okay thanks guys. Lawrence A. Sala - Anaren Microwave Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer Sure. Operator Our next question is from Mark McKechnie with Banc of America Securities. Please go ahead. Greg Patricia - Banc of America Securities - Analyst Hi guys this is [Greg] Patricia for Mark. I had a question for you -- last quarter you commented on visibility, so that's 2-4 weeks I believe. Can you comment on how that looks right now? Is it similar? Lawrence A. Sala - Anaren Microwave Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer I would say if anything is [guarding], it's more volatile than it's been for the last couple of quarters. We're seeing a higher percentage of sales generated from orders within the quarter, or within a month, than we have in the past. Our customers are still trying to provide us with 2-4 weeks of visibility, but I think it's less reliable than it was the last couple of quarters. Both positively and negatively. Greg Patricia - Banc of America Securities - Analyst Okay. I am shifting over to space and defense real quick. I think you mentioned, I think I may have missed it, but you expect $7 million in sales over the next couple quarters or is this foreseeable future? Lawrence A. Sala - Anaren Microwave Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer We are expecting to see a minimum of $7 million in net sales per quarter for at least the remainder of the fiscal year. And depending on how order flow is for the remainder of the year, we'll have a better feel for if that's sustainable longer term. Greg Patricia - Banc of America Securities - Analyst Okay and can you comment on how the Boeing program right now plays into that and where are you filling in for that program, as it doesn't effect to go off before fiscal year's end? 8 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

OCTOBER 22, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q1 2003 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call Lawrence A. Sala - Anaren Microwave Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer Well we're at later stages of that project. So the contribution into net sales per quarter has declined over the last year or year and a half and will decline throughout the remainder of this financial year when bookings complete. But we've delivered, probably, 75% of that contract already. Greg Patricia - Banc of America Securities - Analyst Okay, great. And I guess one last note -- just kind of on a house keeping -- on the tax rate going forward, do you have anything? Joseph E. Porcello - Anaren Microwave Inc. - Vice President Finance Tax rate should be some where around 25%. That depends a little bit on the exact levels of the income. Greg Patricia - Banc of America Securities - Analyst Exactly. Joseph E. Porcello - Anaren Microwave Inc. - Vice President Finance and credits over the rest of the year. But it's modeled on what we want we currently expect now at 25%. Greg Patricia - Banc of America Securities - Analyst Okay, I appreciate it. Thank you, that's all the questions I have. Joseph E. Porcello - Anaren Microwave Inc. - Vice President Finance Sure. Operator As a reminder to our listening audience, if you would like to ask a question please press "*" "1" on your touchtone phone. We will now go to [Earl Wam] with CIBC World Markets. Please go ahead. Earl Wam - CIBC World Markets - Analyst How are you guys doing? Lawrence A.

OCTOBER 22, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q1 2003 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call Earl Wam - CIBC World Markets - Analyst Joe just a couple of housekeeping -- what do you expect CAPEX to be in Q2 and do you have a full year number for us? Joseph E. Porcello - Anaren Microwave Inc. - Vice President Finance The full year should be somewhere in the vicinity of $5 million. We were, kind of, healthy in quarter 1, at close to $2 million. We would expect it would drop-off the other year. 3 million should be split out pretty much about 1 million a quarter going forward. Earl Wam - CIBC World Markets - Analyst Okay, great. And what was the depreciation in the quarter? Joseph E. Porcello - Anaren Microwave Inc. - Vice President Finance Depreciation in the quarter was [inaudible], about $1.2 million, Earl. Earl Wam - CIBC World Markets - Analyst Okay great. And then where there any 10% customers that you guys had during the quarter? Joseph E. Porcello - Anaren Microwave Inc. - Vice President Finance 10% of the overall sales were [Power Wave] what we said it was 19% of our [roads] group net sales. And I don't know if we had a space and defense customer over 10%. Earl Wam - CIBC World Markets - Analyst Okay, so 19% of the wireless revenues? Joseph E. Porcello - Anaren Microwave Inc. - Vice President Finance Right. Earl Wam - CIBC World Markets - Analyst Okay. Joseph E. Porcello - Anaren Microwave Inc. - Vice President Finance It is wireless. 10 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

OCTOBER 22, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q1 2003 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call Earl Wam - CIBC World Markets - Analyst And as you -- out of this [802.11 B] product that you guys introduced, you mentioned two reference design wins with chip manufacturers. Is this knocking out an existing component that's using a different technology [variable], can you walk us through if this is, one of these were -- is an absolute requirement that the use of [balon] versus some other type of technology, if they want to follow the reference design? Lawrence A. Sala - Anaren Microwave Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer Sure. Each customer from our understanding that we get designed in our reference design. I think, likelihood is exceptionally high that it will be manufactured to that reference design, especially relative to our product. As it's very -- has a significant impact on overall system performance. So I think, if we succeed in achieving reference designs, there is a exceptionally high likelihood of production follow through. In terms of what our product does in alternative there are several. Some of our customers to discrete implementation, using discrete components. Some of our customers purchase a [balon] device that's typically manufactured in a different type of technology, where we think we have significant performance advantages over those other product solutions. And some of our customers actually implement [balan] device on chip, so to speak. So they use a single-ended input as opposed to a balanced input. So there are some alternatives. But we feel very confident that if we can achieve design wins, we will see the production follow through. Earl Wam - CIBC World Markets - Analyst Okay and my guess is your strategy is the same thing for the A band in terms of at the 5 gig-? Lawrence A. Sala - Anaren Microwave Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer Correct. Earl Wam - CIBC World Markets - Analyst In terms of again focusing on the reference designs? Lawrence A. Sala - Anaren Microwave Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer Correct. Earl Wam - CIBC World Markets - Analyst And, if you look at where the potential for these margins are relative to some of your other standard component products, are they kind of in the same average or are you going to get better margins on this products? Or obviously given this market, there is significant pricing pressure, what do you think margins are going to be for this new product, I guess new product application line? Lawrence A. Sala - Anaren Microwave Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer Earl, we are never going to see it, where a customer like you are listening that these are expected to be very high margin products [laughter]. They are consistent with our other Xinger type of solutions. So we use the same basic manufacturing technology and expect margins error consistent with our Xinger compliment platform. 11 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

OCTOBER 22, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q1 2003 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call Earl Wam - CIBC World Markets - Analyst Okay and speaking of Xingers could you talk a little bit about obviously with the Xinger isolator parts that were introduced. What is the design in activity on that particular product and is that sorting to gain some fraction with some of these cost reduction efforts that are out there or is that more targeted for a completely new type of system level platform. Lawrence A. Sala - Anaren Microwave Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer Well, our Xinger circulator designed to date. The design activity has been high. The production activity has been quite low. We targeted some of the higher frequency applications initially, which appear to be obviously growing out slowly in the market place. We hope to introduce over the course of the next quarter or so. What we think is an exceptionally cost effective Xinger circulator solution for our customers that will be -- have higher applications to cost reduction efforts that are on going and applicable across our frequency band. So we hope that by the end of this quarter or as late as the end of next quarter we have product that covers every frequency band and covers applications from the higher and high-power applications to the medium-power applications where we think our punch line will be very attractive to our customers. Earl Wam - CIBC World Markets - Analyst Okay, great and then just one final question. You were mentioning certainly visibility remains somewhat limited. Can you talk a little bit about -- sounds like you got a some amount of [terms] business in the quarter. Can you quantify that for us and are you expecting that kind of a same level for Q2. Lawrence A. Sala - Anaren Microwave Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer We are even more significant, I would say within a month we have seen a growth from shipping something like 25% of our shipments in a month on orders that are received that month to moving to something between 30-40% of our shipments in a month being orders received that month in our wireless business. So some product lines are even higher percentage in a month and our custom stuff tends to be a little bit more predictable. But we have seen a pretty appreciable change in shorter-term order patterns. Earl Wam - CIBC World Markets - Analyst And is this causing you to have the stock more inventory and finished goods to meet these shorter-term cycles. Lawrence A. Sala - Anaren Microwave Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer It is in some products. Yes. Earl Wam - CIBC World Markets - Analyst Okay, great thank you gentlemen. Lawrence A. Sala - Anaren Microwave Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer Sure 12 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Cliff Odanodo - RBC Capital Markets - Analyst Thanks. This is Cliff [Odanodo] for Michael [Oakhly]. I wanted you to give some more color on your new product pipeline? Possibly the number of new products you are looking a launch and maybe the type? Joseph E. Porcello - Anaren Microwave Inc. - Vice President Finance Our goal is to launch something between 2-5 products per quarter and our target market place is today are to continue to try to expand our footprints and infrastructure size, both within the power and transmit side as we played historically, but also introducing products on the receipt side in small signal lower power application. And [inaudible] level markets, we believe that there continues to be opportunities to grow our footprints and [inaudible] application and we expect to be continuing to introduce products to that market over the course of the rest of fiscal year. Cliff Odanodo - RBC Capital Markets - Analyst So in total 2-5 per quarter is your target? Joseph E. Porcello - Anaren Microwave Inc. - Vice President Finance Yes. Cliff Odanodo - RBC Capital Markets - Analyst Okay and then as far as the China facility, is production up and running there? Lawrence A. Sala - Anaren Microwave Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer We actually started producing parts there late last quarter. We are qualifying those products now and expect to get into full-qualified production in this quarter. So we did start producing products there last quarter. Cliff Odanodo - RBC Capital Markets - Analyst Okay. Great. That's all I had. Thanks. Lawrence A. Sala - Anaren Microwave Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer Sure. Operator At this we have one question remaining in the queue. I would like to remind everyone that if you like to ask a question, please do so by pressing "*", "1" on your touchtone phone.

So I just have a quick one for you. I was wondering if you could break out percentage of wireless revenues from our [inaudible] revolution. Just give us an idea of much that comes from [Selium and Andrew]. Joseph E. Porcello - Anaren Microwave Inc. - Vice President Finance Well, we -- report from Lucent is actually from Lucent. From [Selium and Andrew] I have to give you an estimate that estimate would be something on your probably 4% of our wireless net sales. Something like 4-5% with their -- that's the estimate that I can give you. Judson Couplin - Morgan Stanley - Analyst Okay. That's great, thanks a lot. Joseph E. Porcello - Anaren Microwave Inc. - Vice President Finance Sure. Operator Our next question is from Kevin [Steedy] with [Royals Fargo]. Please go ahead. Kevin Steedy - Royals Fargo - Analyst Hi guys. Good job given the conditions. Joseph E. Porcello - Anaren Microwave Inc. - Vice President Finance Is it? Kevin Steedy - Royals Fargo - Analyst Larry, just from the 20,000 foot level can you kind of give us a read on what you might see coming up in defense, what you think you might have a short -- short of getting and what you still have in your plate? Lawrence A. Sala - Anaren Microwave Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, I think the opportunities that were pursuing some of which are follow-on opportunities, we expect to see follow on opportunities on the radar side. We see funding flow to our customers and radar side and so we would expect over the next quarter to achieve those orders flow down to us. Pursuing some space-defense opportunities that utilize some of our receiver technology. We are pursuing some follow on orders for our [ship-- jamming] technology in South Korea, in Greece, as well as in Turkey and we also expect to see continuing orders for our location technology that we licensed to Lockheed Martin. And probably half of what we expect our customer responded and we feel to more of the timing issue on the other half of the opportunities, it is something that's being aggressively pursued and we are seeing some pretty positive signs. 14 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Lawrence A. Sala - Anaren Microwave Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer That's where most of our radar work is targeted. So that's the application that we see pretty strong funding and would expect to see orders over the next couple of quarters. Kevin Steedy - Royals Fargo - Analyst Great. Okay, thanks. Lawrence A. Sala - Anaren Microwave Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer Sure. Operator We have follow up question from Rich Valera with Needham & Company. Please go ahead. Rich Valera - Needham and Company - Analyst Thank you. Larry or Joe, I'm just wondering what it would take for you guys to make those more aggressive cost cuts? How many quarters say, what sort of flattish revenue and sort of break even operating profitability before you might take some more aggressive steps to bring the cost structure down? Lawrence A. Sala - Anaren Microwave Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer Rich, if we see to try and continue -- we'll take that action this quarter. Rich Valera - Needham and Company - Analyst Okay. Thank you. Lawrence A. Sala - Anaren Microwave Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Operator And for our final question, we have a follow up from [Earl Wam] with CIBC World Markets.

OCTOBER 22, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q1 2003 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call Earl Wam - CIBC World Markets - Analyst Yeah, Larry you mentioned 4-5% of wireless for [Selium Andrew]. I have missed the number for Lucent, if you could repeat that? Lawrence A. Sala - Anaren Microwave Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer [37%.] Earl Wam - CIBC World Markets - Analyst Okay, and could you talk a little about -- certainly you are looking to release a bunch of new products per quarter. If you have to look right now in terms of your overall mix in terms of new versus -- new products versus, I guess your older product line, what is that mix looking like in? And are you seeing the traction shifting towards the newer products? Lawrence A. Sala - Anaren Microwave Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer You know, when we started really aggressively introducing products last February or so, it was typical for us that at least the nine-month cycle to see those turn into -- turning to significant revenue streams in the infrastructure market. So we really aren't seeing a great deal of revenue generation out of the new product site yet. But we also expect that [inaudible] market we will see a faster transition to production when we achieve design length that we have in the wireless infrastructure market. So we expect in that market to see more like six-month cycle time from reference design win verification to moving into generating revenue. Earl Wam - CIBC World Markets - Analyst So you expecting at least, for example on the 802.11 by Q3 of your fiscal year, you would [inaudible] revenue? Lawrence A. Sala - Anaren Microwave Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, late Q3 more likely Q4, but that sort of timeframe. Earl Wam - CIBC World Markets - Analyst Okay, great. Thank you. Lawrence A. Sala - Anaren Microwave Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Operator Gentleman there is no questions in the queue at this point. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Sala for any additional and closing remarks. Lawrence A.

We have very strong operating performance across all of our business segments. Our reported EPS was up 40%, excluding the non-recurring events in Q3 of '01, it was up 10% and exceeded consensus by a penny. Our reported operating profit was up 42%, again excluding the non-recurring quarter three events of last year it was up 13%. Our European business, which is the focus of our real growth outside the United States, grew 9% in local currencies, a strong performance in light of the economic conditions in Europe. 2 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

OCTOBER 16, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q3 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call During the quarter, we did see acceleration in our North American delivery business. Particularly in the large account segment. Our North American regional comps were minus 2%, in line with our mid-quarter update. We have an extremely strong balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $940 million of cash after the redemption of $241 million of the 1992 alliance. On a sales basis, third quarter revenue increased 4%. Or highest growth percentage since the fourth quarter of 2000. Year to date revenue increased 3. Comparable worldwide sales were up 1% for the third quarter and flat for the first nine months of this year. Worldwide e-commerce sales grew 35% to $543 million and we are on track to exceed over $2 billion of e-commerce sales this year. Virtually all of our customer service metrics across all of our businesses were better than last year and last year was a good performance. The weakening dollar did favorably impact third quarter sales by $33 million for approximately 1%, but on a year-to-date basis it was only impacted by 27. This is the first quarter this year we've had a favorable impact of a weakening U.S. dollar. On a sales growth basis, comp sales, as I said, were down 2% in our North America retail business, primarily reflecting a disappointing back-to-school season and continued weakness in furniture and technology sales. North America retail transactions were flat for the quarter even taking into consideration the disappointing back-to-school season. The average retail ticket was down slightly, less than 1%. On a BSG [INAUDIBLE] sales grew 6% during the third quarter. Our contract segment, our large customer segment, grew more than 7. Our catalog businesses, Office Depot catalog and Viking remain soft, but sequentially improved over the second quarter. Our total international business grew 8% in local currencies, but 17% in U.S. dollars. As I said earlier, Europe grew 9% with local positive trends in the U.K., Germany, Netherlands, Italy and Ireland. Japan had negative comps, both in quarter three and negative year-to-date. On a consolidated operating profit basis, our reported operating profit increased 41% to $142 million. Excluding the non-recurring events in the third quarter of last year, operating income increased 13%, on the sales increase of 4%, continued evidence of Office Depot's ability to find ways to improve our operations, take costs out of our business and improve processes to drive shareholder value. Our North America retail operating profit margins reached 8.4% of sales despite negative comps. The operating profit in BSG for the quarter was up 14% to a record 10% of sales, up 28% year-to-date. I will have comments about that when I talk about BSG. International's operating profit was up 10%, excluding the gain we recorded last year on the sale of our London warehouse. Our gross margins on a consolidated basis grew 63 basis points. The key drivers of the operating profit expansion were retail gross margin improvements, and continued improvements in our BSG North American operating costs. G&A costs were slightly negatively impacted by higher incentive pay accruals across the Company and our strong strategic growth initiatives in Europe. We opened two new countries in Europe this year. We've launched three new contract businesses in Europe this year and that's investment for the growth. Our year-to-date operating profit increased 44%, up 36% when you exclude the non-recurring events that we recorded year-to-date in 2001. Our EPS basis on a fully diluted GAAP basis, we reported an increase of 40% to 28 cents in the quarter compared to 20 in the third quarter last year. This did exceed estimates by a penny, despite the inclusion of an additional $3 million accrual for the anticipated settlement of the class action litigation in the state of California that we commented last quarter. Excluding the non-recurring events in quarter three of 2001, EPS was up more than 10% for the quarter and more than 34% year to date. After-tax income from Australia, which is now treated as a discontinued operation, was just slightly over $1 million and when fully added back to diluted earnings, as I said earlier, the EPS of 28 cents exceeded the consensus by a penny. Now to talk about the business units. North American retail, third quarter sales were down 1% and flat for the year. Comps down 2, as I said earlier, impacted by a weak back-to-school season and continued weakness in furniture and technology sales. Core office supply comps were positive. Furniture was down 9% in the quarter versus down 1 in the second quarter. Technology still down was down less than it was in quarter two. Technology hardware sales were down 5% in the quarter compared to 12% in quarter two. We did see some pickup in technology sales, and in particular we saw a pickup in back-to-school technology sales in an offering we had called Computer In A Box for back-to-school. Our software was up 2% in the quarter. The average ticket as I commented was down slightly, reflecting furniture and technology still being down. Comp transactions were essentially flat for the quarter. Our customer service indexes across retail were all up. An indication that we're serving customers today better than ever before, and we're giving enormously positive comments from our customers, albeit we still do get complaints when you operate a chain of 870 stores in North America. On a North America retail operating profit, we reached an industry-leading 8.4% of sales in Q3. It's our best performance since Q2 of 1999. This is in spite of negative comps. Retail gross margins improved 129 basis points over last year. This comes from the benefits we continue to receive from 3 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

OCTOBER 16, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q3 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call global sourcing,. Global sourcing of back-to-school products did help margins. We get continuing remerchandising benefits and better SKU management. Our in-stock position is higher. We have less shrink of markdown than ever before, because we have the industry's best supply chain. And we have the benefit of the continuing mix shift away from technology. Our store operating costs excluding the California litigation costs, were essentially flat to last year, and this is in spite of substantial increase in benefits to our store employees, and pay increases. And this is the result of our payroll model, which is allocating hours more properly to stores and when we've taken hours out of our stores, we've improved our customer service indexes, and that's what we said we would do with our payroll model. We have improved customer satisfaction, fewer complaints than last year. In the quarter, we had 861 stores at the end of the third quarter, we opened eight this quarter. New stores in North America. And we relocated three stores. Now turning to BSG, sales in this segment increased 6% for the third quarter and on a year to date, 4%, indicating the acceleration I talked about earlier. Our contract division had high single digit growth in the third quarter, reflecting share gain in large national accounts, an area we said we'd begin to emphasize. Our western region, which has had basically negative sales growth through the first half of this year, was basically flat. We've now anniversaried the worst comparisons we had with the technology era, we're at a strong position in Northern California. We still expect our contract division to continue improving for the remainder of this year. Our average order size continued to show some improvement in this business segment. That's a healthy sign to us, indication that customers were earning more of our customer share [INAUDIBLE], which is one of our primary goals. As I said earlier, domestic e-commerce sales grew 34% for the quarter and 35 year to date, expanding our worldwide lead position in e-commerce sales. Our warehouse customer service indexes were all up, reflecting better on-time performance in our warehouses. Our on-time delivery performance for the quarter just ended was 99.4%. It's a record high for Office Depot. And that's an indication of the kinds of service we're giving our customers. Our business service group operating profits increased 70 basis points from 9.4% last year to 10.1 in this quarter. In quarter three of 2000, just two years ago, the operating profit in this business was 5.8% of sales. That's the indication of the significant improvements we've accomplished in this business and we continue to get better. Our third quarter gross margins declined slightly by 66 basis points. Reflecting the impact of the lower margin business of our rapidly growing For Sure dot-com business. Some softer furniture sales and somewhat lower percentage supplier volume rebates and some overall mix changes primarily at Viking. Our third quarter selling operating expenses were down 136 basis points year-over-year, reflecting the continued improvement in warehouses and call centers around North America. Looking ahead, we do expect some pressure on fourth quarter operating margins in this segment, as we further increase the mix of technology sales at For Sure dot-com. We activate additional sales force hiring which we deferred until late in the third quarter. And began to put more emphasize on large accounts and we have managed the ongoing pressure on sales and margins in our Viking domestic mail order business. We did in the quarter defer the hiring of some sale reps in this business segment, in essence, making this quarter's 10.4% operating income a little high on an ongoing basis. We have hired those reps and will continue to invest as we intend to grow this business. Our DSO in this business improved to 46 days from 51 last year, reflecting tie-in sales compensation to the behavior we want from our sales reps. It affects order size and helps it. It affects account profitability and it drives receivable collections. And that's an indication as you can see by the strong cash flows in our businesses. Turning to the international front, our third quarter internation sales in U.S. dollars grew 17%, up 8% in local currencies, year to date, 9%. Foreign currency translations as I said earlier did benefit the quarter by $32.7 million. Our European contracts sales in five new countries continue to grow and meet our expectations. We launched Italy in September, we are on track to launch Germany in January. We're very encouraged by our contract start-ups in Europe. This represents an investment in growth for the future. That we know how to manage and grow a contract business based on our experience in the U.S., and we're delighted with our European results in these segments. Our sales results reflect Viking's two newest countries, Spain and Switzerland, both which are accelerating. We're pleased to date with the performance of the two new Viking countries and that serves as a foundation to later on launch Office Depot sales reps from the existing infrastructure we built in Spain and Switzerland. Retail comps in France in the quarter softened and were 5% in local currency. 15% in U.S. dollars. We had 32 stores at the end of the third quarter, one opened and one closed. We intend to continue to add to our retail presence in France. France Office Depot, which 4 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

OCTOBER 16, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q3 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call includes retail catalog and BSD, that's our contract business, actually grew 18% in local currencies in the quarter,r 29% in U.S. dollars. Reflecting where we're putting our emphasis in France, growing the business other than the direct mail business, which we think reaches at some stage in maturity so we have invest in other ways to grow our business. Retail comps in Japan were minus 11% of local currency and 9% negative in U.S. dollars. No new stores were opened. We finished the quarter with 12 stores open in Japan. On the operating profit basis, third quarter operating profit declined 9% for the quarter but excluding the gain in our London warehouse, which we had last year, operating profit was actually up 10%. It was down as a percentage of sales, reflecting our planned investments in new countries and new channels, and exchange rates did positively affect operating results this quarter by $4.2 million. On a year to date basis for 4. So, you can see the exchange rate helped both revenue and operating income in this segment for the quarter. Gross margins decreased 71 basis points in the third quarter, primarily the result of higher prospecting from the new countries of Spain and Switzerland and a little higher mix of BSD, which has slightly lower margins and retailed lower margins. So, it's really a mix issue, not a price issue. Our sales and warehouse operating costs increased 18% or 9 basis points. This was driven by the start-up costs in Spain and Switzerland and the heavy payroll costs by adding contract sales reps now in five countries. We opened the U.K. about 18 months ago. We now have 175 sales reps in the U.K., Office Depot sales reps. We are not making money in this business segment yet, but we're on track with our plan, and this business will be profitable and forms the foundation for our continued growth in Europe. In spite of the negative comps in Japan, operating losses in Japan were less than last year. And as I said, our operating margins have been and will continue to be impacted by the country's start-up costs in Spain and Switzerland, our new contract sales channel, as we continue to invest in this high Rona business, this positive cash flow business and high return on sales business, we continue investor growth for the future. So, in summary, as I said in the release, looking forward, we remain comfortable at this time with the fourth quarter consensus earnings expectations. We do see operating strength across all of our businesses in virtually every one of our key operating quality, customer service and employee retention metrics. Changing our culture to a compelling place to work, shop and invest is paying huge dividends as our people continue to find ways to improve processes that take costs out of our business without cutting payroll and people. And improving quality. Our supply chain remains the best in class with industry-leading inventory turns and high customer service levels. We are on track to significantly improve our Rona in 2002 to low double digits. Our fourth quarter assumptions look for a gradual revenue acceleration in our North America delivery businesses. A little softer growth rate in our international business in the third quarter, but not a lot softer. And flat to slightly positive comps in our North American retail business. While we expect strong growth in operating income in the third quarter, we do expect some pressure on fourth quarter operating margins, particularly in BSD, as we increase the mix of technology, sales and retail in For Sure, activate additional sales force hiring that we have deferred and manage the ongoing pressure on sales and margins in our Viking domestic mail order operations. Our balance sheet has never been stronger and we remain poised to accelerate our sales and earnings growth when the economy regains momentum and it eventually will. We have made significant strides in making Office Depot one of the most compelling places to work, shop and invest, as evidenced by our ability to continue to generate strong operating results in very difficult economic environment. I continue to say and I say again, I just wouldn't bet against Office Depot in the long-term. On that basis, we'd like now to turn the call over to you and we will answer what questions you have about the quarter, the outlook for the remainder of the year and the business as we see it. So, we'll turn the call now over to the operator for questions. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Operator Thank you very much. [ INDISCERNIBLE ] The first question is from Matt Kassler of Goldman Sachs. 5 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

OCTOBER 16, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q3 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call Matt Kassler - Goldman Sachs Thanks a lot and good morning. Can you hear me? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer We can, good morning, Matt. Matt Kassler - Goldman Sachs Great. Good morning. Two questions if I may. First of all, what is it that you see in the business that gives you a sense that retail comps are likely to show better in the fourth quarter than they did in the third quarter? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer In the kind of economic environment, it is difficult to predict, but we saw sequential improvement during the third quarter based -- with our best month in September. Now that, comes against anniversarying the year ago the events in New York of September 11th. And the early part of October, we've seen some signs that lead us to believe that at this point that we can comp either neutral or slightly positive on our North American retail stores. That's looking at the product mix, it's traffic counts, it is transactions. It's the activities as we see it. We do all have a holiday season we have to look at and I don't know that any one of us has a handle on that. Holiday gift-giving is not a really significant part of Office Depot, however, the business part of holiday gift-giving is. So, based on what we saw in the third quarter, some trends we see to date, we believe that retail will comp either slightly flattish or slightly positive. Matt Kassler - Goldman Sachs Gotcha. My second question I put under the broad topic of international asset management. You've got a tremendous amount of cash, you're net inventory negative, so you're working capital management has given you a lot of liquidity. You've talked about selling Japan and can you've also talked about doing some things in the contract business overseas and we've seen some precedent for that in the past quarter. Can you give us a sense of the timing with which you'd look to do something in Japan to the extent that business doesn't get better? And the timing with which you'd look to get more agressive in Europe? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Well, I think several things. What I have talked about Japan is it is a critical part of our future. We have continued to improve our operating losses, albeit it's still significant. We have no current plans to exit Japan. We continue to evaluate it. We do see some signs in some aspect of our business model that are encouraging. It's too soon for us to exit. We believe we've taken a lot of actions, particularly in the last six months and while it is not a great economic environment, I think for the foreseeable future we plan to stay in Japan. I think if we can't see some light by mid next year that's more -- better than what we've seen on the sales side, I think it -- we may have to take a look at it. But we've invested a lot of time there, a fair amount of money, and believe that from a competitive standpoint, if we can make this succeed, it will be an enormous success. But I think this is a -- this needs a little more time to cook, if you will. Matt Kassler - Goldman Sachs Sure. 6 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

OCTOBER 16, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q3 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer We are selling Australia. We've announced that sale and we're in the process of doing that and we just couldn't get scale and it's an indication for us that if we can't get scale and have a significant presence, then the business doesn't have a lot of interest to us. As it relates to Europe, we are getting very aggressive on investing in organic growth. That organic growth will have our sixth country open, be it Germany, in January. That's a significant P&L investment in growing. But, you know, investment as sales rep sales managers, some incremental inventory and incremental advertising costs. The question I suppose you really have is are we going to use our balance sheet to grow our contract position outside the United States? And I've said and will continue to say and I can't and won't comment on any particular transaction, but clearly contract represents an important part of our strategy in Europe. We believe we have the base of operations, the knowledge, the technology, the platform, the skills, the language and the culture to be successful in this business combined with our experience in North America. We will use our balance sheet if there are opportunities that make sense for us. And they've got to make sense. They've got to make sense in all the aspects. They've got to make sense first of all from what you pay, if you buy it. They've got to make sense from a cultural perspective. They've got to fit. They've got to make sense from the standpoint do you face issues of integration? People in this business have failed, a lot, by trying to integrate things that don't fit. So, I'm open-minded and have said all along we'd be open-minded about using our balance sheet to grow, both in Europe and frankly selectively grow in North America and that remains our position and that's why we have cash and what I said about the cash, it's a nice problem to have. It is less than a year old as a problem. And what we've said at Office Depot is we're going to drive Rona. We have good evidence of that this year and intend to do that in the future. And cash sitting on your balance sheet and lots of it over a long period of time does not drive Rona. So, what you've got to find ways to invest that cash to grow your business and I'm open-minded about doing that, but I'm also, and I say I, I've got a board that's very much with me, I'm pretty focused on making sure we get value and if we buy we don't overpay. Matt Kassler - Goldman Sachs Just one final follow-up, can you tell us what it is costing you now on an annual basis to open these new European contract operations? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer I think if you add -- I think last quarter we broke the number out. But if you, I won't do the contract alone, but if you look at what we're investing in the opening of Switzerland and Spain, plus our contract businesses, you can assume we have 25 to $35 million of operating losses invested in this business in Europe. And I will be directionally accurate. Matt Kassler - Goldman Sachs Gotcha. Thank you very much. Operator The next question is from Danielle Fox of JP Morgan. Danielle Fox - JP Morgan Thanks, good morning. I have two questions. First, could you just talk a little bit about how the competitive landscape is evolving? In particular, what impact has a seemingly resurgent Office Max had on your business? And what are your initial thoughts on how Sam's Club intensified focus on the small business customer might affect Office Depot? 7 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

OCTOBER 16, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q3 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Danielle. First question about the competitive landscape. I think I'd first describe pricing because that's always everyone's concern, is relatively benign. We're all priced competitively on items across our board and the customer makes us do that and that's been that way for a while and I don't see any change in that. I think Max's performance of supply chain is causing them to get a higher share of wallet of the customer that went to Max in the first place. I mean -- this is my perspective and I don't know if my good colleague and friend Mike Foray would share it, but I think a year ago they had some service level issues in their stores. I think they've improved those pretty significantly, and I think they're getting a higher share of the customer who first chooses Max either because of the convenience and/or loyalty. And we've all got customers that are enormously loyal. I think Max, my perspective, probably had the best back-to-school season. I think it was better than ours. I don't know about Staples, but my guess is it was. And I think that's the case because our research shows, and this may not be what Max research shows because you never quite know, but our research says that Office Max has always had a bigger share of the consumer wallet than the small to medium-sized business wallet. And I think they perform better at back-to-school than we did. I can speak to that. And that performance was an in-stock position and I think a customer mix that leans more toward consumers. Our customer mix in retail has always been predominantly small and medium-sized businesses. Our weekend business is somewhat consumer-oriented and back-to-school consumer oriented. So a resurgence, Max, I was never of the side that said they were going away. And I know lots of analysts predicted the demise of Max. And I've always said internally I plain didn't believe that and I don't. Where they compete with us and Staples on the same corner or across the street. You're convenience. When you can't find ways to differentiate yourselves, in which we all three struggle with that at the moment, then you get convenience. So resurgent means a higher share of the wallet. I don't think they're taking share from us. I think they're getting a larger share of the wallet of the customer that was loyal. That's my view. Relative to Sam's, you know, I read the same things you all have and they've got a new leader at Sam's that wants to make a resurgence in the small business. They do have a different model and we will have to see how it works. The average packet side is a lot larger than most small businesses want to buy. The SKU selection is a lot less than most small businesses want to buy and I think their impact could be as much or more on Costco small business customers as Office Depot. I think there are certain SKUs that are attractive to clubs. They've always been attractive to clubs. They always will be attracted to clubs and we price our sales and always had to try to mitigate that price difference between a couple hundred SKUs. So, I don't see today a big issue relative to Sam's getting more aggressive in the back -- in the small to medium-sized business. But we will watch them closely. Danielle Fox - JP Morgan Just one quick follow-up. Has your experience this back-to-school season at all changed your view on sort of how aggressively Office Depot will pursue that business in the future? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Well, by view means that it will be a key part of our future. First of all, we did it differently this year. The large percentage of the SKUs in back-to-school are SKUs that we have year-round. We do have some one-type purchases, frankly, our supply chain performed extraordinarily well and our shrink and markdown of those was less than its ever been. It brings traffic to its stores and to try to turn away that traffic is just plain not smart. We do spend a little more in media advertising in the forms of television at that time of year, but frankly that's a great time of year to media televised advertising any place. We just happen to focus on back-to-school. So, it is an important part on what we see as our business that seasonality. I might add, by the way, on our delivery side and our contract side, school business is an important vertical to us, and one we have grown our position in, and one we think we can continue to grow our position in, again, because the vast majority of the SKUs are the same. So, back-to-school is an important part of our 8 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

OCTOBER 16, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q3 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call future. We've -- we've kind of done a -- let's take a look at what we did good and what we didn't do so good. I've got a new merchant that joined us, I think our back-to-school next year will be better. Danielle Fox - JP Morgan Great. Thank you. Operator The next question is from Aram Rubinson of Bank of America. Aram Rubinson - Bank of America Thanks, hi, guys. A couple of questions, one is the inventory turns seemed to show a bit of an accelerated improvement versus last year. I'm curious whether you are certain that you have enough inventory and that sometimes the inventory returns can go too far in one direction. That's the first, then I have a follow-up. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer The first question, Aram, I'm absolutely confident we have enough inventory because what you won't see and what I won't break out are the in-stock service levels of all of our businesses. That's stores where we measure in-stock on the entire SKU mix in the store. That ads, in which we advertise in retail stores we measure our in-stock position. That's a critical measurement of our customer in the delivery businesses and I can tell you unequivocally that those measurements are up not down. And that indicates to me that we've got enough inventory. Second of all, one of the reasons why our inventory is sequentially down is that we performed a lot better in back-to-school in spite of a softer season relative to getting in and getting it out. Our supply chain continues to improve. You -- you probably know, I'll just remind you, that we go at store supply chain different than our two competitors. Our two competitors come at it from large warehouses, we come at it from [INAUDIBLE], we basically clear those docks every night, and we've got lots of other people who want to look at our docks and retailers and find out how we do it for the cost we do it at. It is just a good supply chain, and frankly, I think we can take more inventory out of our stores, and more inventory out of our supply chain because I know the metrics of that inventory, again, we don't break out in terms of its age, and there are still opportunities left to do that, Aram. Aram Rubinson - Bank of America And the other question relates to merchandising. Do you believe that in order to drive sales that your merchandising will head in a different direction and kind of along the same lines, although not really. Are you leaving money on the table in margin because of the amount of accounts payable that you're squeezing out, is there an opportunity to trade at a 2% interest rate environment? Swap the cash for margin. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Two questions first, one is the merchandise. I think there's not going to be any substantial change in the direction of merchandise at Office Depot. I think we're going to get better at vertical merchandising. Both in retail and our contract and delivery businesses. I think we're going get and are getting a lot better at discreet assortments that differ by store, by region, by part of the country. Which means you may not go into a store and see the exact same SKU in every single store in North America because we think there are differences by region. 9 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

OCTOBER 16, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q3 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call I think direction-wise we're going to focus on the core office supply items, the things our customers want to buy. We're going to use technology to help deliver information. We have interesting things going on in our stores. As it relates to our accounts payable and using accounts payable, the answer is if you're asking can we get a bigger discount from vendors by paying quicker, I think -- I don't know the answer to that question. I think that we have to focus on -- on a manufactured time. Be more clear with the question for me, would you? Aram Rubinson - Bank of America I guess there is an opportunity, you can either take the cash and extend the payment dates, but in a 2% interest rate environment, I didn't know if it made more sense to try to get those discounts rather than hold them out to terms. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer We looked at each supplier. I think -- you know, Dave certainly is going to take a look at that. But -- I don't think there is a huge opportunity there, Aram. I think we're pretty good negotiators today, I think we trade off pretty well, payment terms versus discount terms versus volume rebate terms versus ad money. I think what you look at when you look at a supplier is not just one element of that. You have to look at the whole package and I think we're pretty good at it. Do I think we can we get better at it? Yeah. And I think Dave, our new merchant-help us get even better at that. Aram Rubinson - Bank of America Good luck, Bruce, thanks. Operator The next question is from Colin McClanahan from Sanford Bernstein. Colin McClanahan - Sanford Bernstein Yes, on the line for Colin McClanahan. Most of our questions have actually been asked and answered, but I just have two quick ones. First, you showed a lot of improvement in the gross margin in the North American retail and there are obviously a number of factors that led to that improvement. Could you also give us some sense of just how much the shift from -- away from furniture and technology and towards core office products helped the improvement year-over-year? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Well, actually the shift away from furniture doesn't improve margins. Furniture is a pretty high-margin item because it has a lot of cost. So actually the shift away from furniture would have the impact of bringing margins down, not up. The technology question is -- I just frame it -- if you go back a year ago, we had roughly about 20% of our North American sales in retail sales in technology. I will define that for a minute, it's hardware, laptops, desk tops, all in one machines, printers, digital cameras, scanners. That was roughly 20% a year ago. Two years it was over 25%. Today it is less than 14%. That business generally has a margin mix in the low teens, some have lower than that, some higher than that. Frankly, I haven't done the math to figure that out. I think when you get all done, you'd say that what's really driven the margin improvement is that we've got a growing private label, sales and retail in particular, we buy it better, frankly. We've been global sourcing for well over two years. We don't talk a great deal about it. We happen to be unique in the sense that we can both sell it, buy it globally and we can sell it globally. We think that gives us some leverage that others can't do. If you look at our shrink and markdowns over the last two years, it's less and that means our supply chain is better. If you looked at how we've merchandised some stores, we've got related items side by side better, so, today when someone buys a low-margin all in one machine, we have 10 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

OCTOBER 16, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q3 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call remerchandised that to have a cable next to it in some stores and that drives margin. It is not one thing, it is not raising prices because the environment won't let you do that. It's, Colin, 10s and 20s of little things that add up. I know there's always been a concern that says this thing runs out of gas. Well, our opinion is certainly we're not going to get the huge increase in margins we've seen over the last year but this model is not out of gas. There is 20, 30, 40 basis points that can just -- we can find ways to do this. And it's a combination of all of those things. So, it is not just one thing. I think if you saw, our shrink is industry-low in fact, sometimes I would argue with our people that shrink is maybe too low from the standpoint sometimes we ought to take a lot more risk. We execute better today. That means plan-a-grams are in and out better. That means discontinued SKUs are out. That means stuff goes back to manufacturers quicker and faster and we get recovery from that. It is just lots and lots of little things. It isn't one big thing and frankly our people, every quarter, every month, every day, find another little idea that adds just a little bit and it is the aggregation of those little bits that add up to be meaningful numbers. Colin McClanahan - Sanford Bernstein Thanks. And actually, in your response you kind of touched on my last question, which is -- I was hoping you could give us an update on kind of the status and your outlook for private label penetration? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer We've always -- I say always, in the last two years we started private label two years ago. This is an interesting discussion because in some cases you discuss it and it makes your key suppliers really nervous. And suppliers have to be somewhat partnerships with you to make this effectively work. But I think you can say just directionally we'd like to see private label sales in retail exceed 20%. If you go a target and I think it could go north of that. But if you just said 20%, we got lots of room to grow on that. Private label sales in the delivery businesses have always been higher because primarily large customers demand private label frankly from a price perspective, but retail, directionally, I think you're looking at north of 20% as a goal. Colin McClanahan - Sanford Bernstein Great, best of luck in the current quarter. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Thanks. Operator The next question is from Daniel Bender of Buckingham Research Group. Daniel Bender - Buckingham Research Group Good morning. A couple of questions. You've done a great job on the margin front, you've addressed some of the opportunities you think are out there. I guess specifically focusing on delivery, what do you -- could you quantify for us roughly what you think every percentage point of sales gives you in terms of leverage or operating margin opportunity? That's the first question. The second question, could you give us an update on your buyback program? And third question, if you could provide us with some visibility on what technology and furniture comps look like going forward versus what they have been recently. 11 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

OCTOBER 16, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q3 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer The first question, Dan flow-through. I don't think that's something we ought to try to articulate and quantify because it varies a bit by -- by account and frankly when you get the large contract accounts it flows through less, but it drives volume and you get some benefits in delivery. I think the take-away here without getting specific on it because I don't think that's appropriate, honestly, is to say, look, you can see what happens when we start to get sales increases in our delivery business. We know how to leverage them. And frankly, we're getting better at the flow-through relative to delivery costs and overtime costs and other kinds of costs. We're getting the real benefit of the technology investments we made in our North American warehouses last year in terms of using technology to drive quality and efficiency. One of the things I'm proud of is we've not had to layoff very many people at Office Depot over the last year and a half in spite of very difficult economic requirements. So as I say, large accounts will mix down this percentage. Large accounts have less gross margin and less net profits but incrementally there is still good return on net assets. So, this business won't stay at 10% because we want a higher mix of larger accounts and you just can't do that. But this business at 7 or 8% is a pretty nice business. That's the first question. Relative to the buyback, our board authorized at the beginning of this year a $50 million buyback. We'll complete that by year-end. We basically said it's basically 80% complete at the moment. And we will complete it during the fourth quarter. It's on a pragmatic basis so we keep ourselves in compliance with all the laws relative to buybacks. We set a set of instructions and we don't tinker with them. That's been in place since the first of the year. In theory, our board has talked and said we want to take out the effect of stock option dilution going forward and so you can anticipate that we would have an ongoing in the neighborhood of $50 million buyback on an annual basis. We do have some restrictions on buying back more stock than that as a result of some covenants have on bonds. And we'll live within those covenants. One of the things we've tried to do is establish credibility with the financial institutions and the credit rating institutions and we will not violate that. That's the stock buyback issue. The third question was -- furniture comps. I think that furniture will continue to linger. I would suspect -- I would expect in the fourth quarter it would be negative in retail. I think that's an indication of the confidence small and medium businesses have right now. And when we're talking about furniture and retail, we're talking about a $99 chair, we're not talking about $500 chairs here. You look at that and say that is kind of linked to the economy. We've always had a high furniture position relative to Staples and Max. We long ago emphasized furniture. We think we do it well. We think we will continue to do it well. I will suspect it will be negative comps in the fourth quarter. I think next year is all about the economy and I don't pretend to be an economist, on technology I think that this quarter, with the launch of Hewlett-Packard's broad range of products, of which we're doing relatively well, I would -- I would expect that technology will still be negative but kind of in the same range as today. We do have some concern about the lingering effects of the dock strike. We've got some goods in the docks. We've fortunately anticipated this and we had about 75% of our holiday season things that we buy overseas on land prior to the stock to the dock -- but we've got manufacturers that -- including some furniture items and technology items that, bring stuff in from overseas, particularly the Far East. And we have to see how this unfolds. Don't know that part yet, Dan. Looking forward to next year, our own outlook of next year is to say from our perspective it will be about the same. We don't see a real change in the economic outlook for next year. We're planning it to be the same as it is this year, hopefully we will get surprised by upside and not downside. Daniel Bender - Buckingham Research Group Great, thanks. Operator The next question is from Jeff Black of Lehman Brothers. 12 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

OCTOBER 16, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q3 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call Jeff Black - Lehman Brothers Hey, good morning. Just had one wanted you to answer a brief question on the G&A trends. You mentioned you put off hiring for the direct sales force this quarter. What kind of rate do we expect G&A to continue to increase over the next couple of quarters? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Jeff, I'm going to turn to my colleague on on my right, Charlie Brown and ask him to give you insight on that. Jeff Black - Lehman Brothers Okay, thanks. Charles Brown - Office Depot, Inc. - Chief Executive Officer Well, G&A in the quarter was -- was higher than our normal run rate. Largely because of the investments we're marketing Europe. As you know, Jeff, when we build these business in Europe, we go in first with the Viking, and what we do is build the complete infrastructure and then start our prospecting and our sales efforts. So, international, if you look year-over-year at the increase in international -- in dollars, international is well over 50% of that increase. We're also spending some money here in the U.S., as you know, we're off to a record year from the EPS perspective. That relates to some of the incentive accruals that Bruce talked about earlier. So, our G&A, we watch it very, very closely in dollar terms and we think our G&A under control. It's going to be in about the 4.5% range for the balance of the year. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer We have not -- we have not reduced head count as a way to try and cut costs at Office Depot. That's about our culture. We've been real careful about adding G&A head count, continue to be so. An element of our G&A cost this year that's really unplanned, unforecast and frankly is concerning us is healthcare costs. Which are rising substantially faster than anything we anticipated. And that's a growing problem for corporate America and certainly Office Depot. Charles Brown - Office Depot, Inc. - Chief Executive Officer And in that regard, we elected not to pass those costs along to our employees this year. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer This past year. But Charlie's right about the range. I think it is driven predominantly by our focus in Europe, if you broke out G&A in North America and took out -- took out the extra incentive pay, you'd say we did a good job in managing our G&A. Jeff Black - Lehman Brothers And it may be too early to talk about it, but going into next year, you sort of, you know, take us through the first half, same kind of investments in Europe that we've seen over the past couple of quarters, or will that decelerate a little bit? 13 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

OCTOBER 16, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q3 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer No, I think our -- if you look at -- if I just speak to Europe next year because not the first half because you get the timing of this, we will probably spend a little more CAPEX in Europe next year than this year. As we find ways to use our cash to drive efficiencies in our businesses. Plus, as we grow in Europe, we got some countries that are growing in double-digit rates, we have to invest in facilities. We've got some retail -- we're opening stores in Japan, retail. That takes some CAPEX. We have been careful about CAPEX this year because we want to drive Rona. We're going to end the year probably spending less Cap Ex than we thought and we will carry some of that over into next year. When we talk about next year, you will see a delta in CAPEX next year, but we will end with something less than we thought we would spend. But just directionally a little more investment in Europe next year than this past year as we continue to build and plan for the future in that business. And when I say Europe, I'm predominantly talking about Europe. Like international, I'm predominantly talking about Europe. Jeff Black - Lehman Brothers Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator Mr. Nelson, there are no further questions, sir. I will turn the call back over to you. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Well, in summary, thanks very much for your interest and your insightful questions. I've hopefully given you clarity to what brought on our performance. We're proud of what we've accomplished at Office Depot. I know all of you and all of us are concerned about how we grow the top line. I can tell you that we have spent, inordinate amounts of time, effort and energy. We believe we have some ways identified as opposed to speak of those ways in advance, we will let the numbers speak for themselves, but you should know we're focused on continually growing both the top and bottom line. We still see opportunities to get improvements in our operating metrics. We've now demonstrated well over two years of being able to do that and we think there is more left, albeit it might be a less rate, we're not done with the improvements in Office Depot. We're committed to grow shareholder value. We talk about it a lot at our company. Our board talks about it a lot, how we use our cash to grow the business. And one way or another, we will grow our shareholder value. That will be evidenced this year by a substantially improved Rona. And Rona will go up next year, as well, even in a difficult economic environment. Appreciate your support. If you have any other questions, feel free to give us a call. I'd like to encourage you and remind those of you that would like to attend our meeting here in Florida in November, we will take the majority of the meeting and talk about the future at Office Depot, won't not a lot about numbers or metrics, we'll talk about some of our growth initiatives and some of our insight about what we learned about our customers and competitors and products and verticals. Hopefully if you come down and hear that, you will leave with the same degree of excitement we all have about our business, not just here in North America, but in Europe, as well. This is a different company than it was a couple of years ago. It is a company that knows how to execute and focus and we can and will deliver extraordinary results when we get a little more benefit in the economy and sooner or later we will. Thank you very much for your time. Have a great day. Bye-bye. Operator Thank you for participating in today's conference. You may now disconnect. 14 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Bernstein & Company - Analyst PRESENTATION Operator Good afternoon, Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to Unilever's 2003 Second Quarter Pre-results Update Conference Call. This conference will begin with the presentation by Mr. Howard Green, Senior Vice President Investor Relations, followed by a question and answer session. This conference is being recorded and will be available for a period of two weeks. Details of the replay numbers and access codes can be found on Unilever's website. An audio webcast of the teleconference will also be available on Unilever's website at www.unilever.com. We will shortly hand you over to Mr. Green. Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this conference call, whose purpose is to update the market on the progress of our business. A transcript of the teleconference presentation can be accessed by our website at www.unilever.com, and is also being released to the relevant stock exchanges by their news services. The transcript contains the usual disclaimers as to forward-looking statements within the meaning of the relevant U.S. legislation, and this presentation and discussions are conducted subject to that disclaimer. I propose that I do not read it out but that we take the disclaimer as read into the record for the purpose of this conference call. This update is based on the first two months of trading in the quarter. Comments on EPS are made on a before exceptional item items and goodwill amortization basis. Let me start by conferring our outlook for earnings per share growth for the year of low double digits, notwithstanding a more challenging business environment than the one we expected at the outset of the year. One of the long-standing strengths of our business is its ability to sustain earnings and cash flow growth by successfully navigating through such changes and challenges. By staying focused on the consumer, we're able to reshape the execution of plans by focusing resources in the places where they create the most value. For example, we continue to focus our investment behind the key innovations, increase the role of value propositions within our portfolio, and tailor our plans in the areas of the business which are most impacted such as prestige fragrances. This together with vigorous attention to cost management allows us to ensure that we protect long-term business health. 2 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Pre-Close Conference Call EPS growth for the first half year is expected to be flat. The achievement of our full-year target will be driven by, firstly, restructuring savings which are running at around 100 million Euros per quarter and as such, are well on track to deliver the 700 million Euros expected over 2003 and 2004. Secondly, an improved mix, as we benefit from a greater proportion of higher margin categories including Personal Care. Thirdly, we see progress in a number of developing and emerging markets where we've taken pricing action to recover the devaluation led cost increases and also where we have been seeing stabilization of currencies in key markets. In addition in 2003, we now expect some euro 600 million of savings from our Global Buying Program, which is ahead of our plan that we communicated at the start of the year. Product logic, which many of you saw in Chicago last week, gives further impetus to future benefits. In terms of advertising and promotion, we expect a level for the year similar to or slightly ahead of that in 2002. Finally, we're gaining structural benefits in tax and expect a BEIA tax rate of 30 to 32% over the next few years, while this year, as last, we expect to be at the lower end of this range. In respect to the phasing of EPS growth for the year, there are a number of elements, which lead to awaiting to the second half. These are, firstly, a relatively high A&P spend in the latter part of 2002, from the back-end-loaded innovation plan. Secondly, the impact of dilution from disposals, especially Diversey Lever and Mazola, which is expected to be close to 3% for the first half year, but much less in the second half. Thirdly, we have successfully implemented a new go to market approach in our foods business in North America. Our experience elsewhere shows that it brings sustainable benefits in the extended supply chain in the efficiency and effectiveness of promotions and the speed of bringing innovations to market. However, in the short term, it has a planned one-off negative impact in the first half year of an estimated euro 50 million on operation profit. In looking at the quality and comparability of the EPS growth this year, it should also be remembered that both out target and results continue to reflect the impact of pensions under FRS17 accounting and the expensing of stock options which account for the equivalence of some six percentage points of EPS growth. Turning to the top line, in the second quarter, we expect leading brand growth of around 3%. Within the quarterly growth, we expect to see a pickup in foods, including the expected bounce from Easter and not withstanding the continued soft performance from Slim Fast and the home channels including food service. In Home & Personal Care, a business that has delivered above-the-target growth in the last three years, we expect growth below the Unilever long-term target range but in the quarter, we see an accelerated impact from the focus on improving laundry margins, a sharp decline in Prestige due to reduced demand in travel retail, and the impact of continued trade de-stocking in the U.S. In respect to our mass market business in the U.S., it is important to point out that based on six-channel market share data which gives us 95% coverage of our HPC sales, we have maintained our aggregate market share throughout the year. Thus based on our expectations for the second quarter, along with our experience in the first quarter, we have clearly given up more of the headroom in our plan and we're comfortable with at this stage of the year and are therefore adjusting the growth outlook for the leading brands to some 4% for the year. There are three main factors behind the lower planned performance. Firstly, Slim Fast accounts for a little over 40 basis points off the growth rate for the year. Secondly, sharper than expected trade de-stocking including the effect of some retailers facing financial difficulties. We believe this has largely run its course, but it is expected to reduce the full-year growth rate by 40 basis points. Thirdly, the market conditions in Prestige and out of home channels including food service have an impact of 30 basis points. Before we move to Q & A, I think it might also be useful to remind ourselves that the success of past growth will be decided at the end of the 20-lap program and not at any intermediate measurement point. Indeed the path to growth strategy remains as valid today, as it did at the beginning of the program. The reasons for that are simple. 3 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Pre-Close Conference Call Path to growth was designed to realize a significant step-up in delivering value and achieving top third total shareholder return amongst our peer group. At its heart was our desire to bring about an acceleration in the profitable growth of our business. Unprofitable growth has always been easy, so our strategy looked to step up our performance on all of the levers of value creation. With respect to top line growth, we set out to change our portfolio in order to focus on the faster growing areas of our markets and of those businesses where we have scale and leading positions. Focus on our leading brands, those that are on trend with the consumer and are number one or two in their markets. Programs in their consumer heartland to reinforce strength, fill in geographic white space, stretch across categories, and to take brands to where consumers are consuming. Use the focus on brands and the underpinning knowledge and capability to bring sharpness to innovation with fewer more impact full development capable of being rolled out with speed. In short brands up for the right consumer value and they are the brands that retailers must have to drive traffic through their stores. Portfolio and brand focus would enable us to better realize the scale advantage and synergy of our business leading to improvements in two of the other levers of value creation, enhanced margins and improved capital efficiency. Indeed, looking at progress since the past growth, it has translated itself into a 50% increase in free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow after capital expenditure, financial investments including the purchase of shares to hedge options programs, and tax charge, for the 12 months to end quarter one, 2003, this is running at 4.2 billion Euros. It is cash flow in the expectation of its growth, which determines economic value of the company and by implication, should determine the enterprise value. Over the last 10 years, free cash flow has grown by compound average rate of 13% per annum, whilst growth in enterprise value has lacked this. Looked at another way, based on our share price at the end of last year, Unilever's valuation implicitly assumes no free cash flow growth in real terms. This is not what we planned, nor is it what our track record suggests. If we look at our track record and using EPS growth as a good surrogate for long-term cash generation, it shows over the first 70 years of our existence, EPS grew by an average of nearly 8% and through the 1990s by 9% per annum. Past growth is about acceleration in value delivery, and thus cash momentum in our business which we see in the development of the cash flows as I've just described. Operationally, we've executed a wide-ranging program in line with our intentions and as we set out for the market. The fact that enterprise value has not kept pace with the improvement in cash generation and that the share price at the end of the last year did not reflect any free cash growth in real tones shows that we have yet to convince the market about the sustainability of our improved performance. That continues to be our challenge. So in summary, it is the robustness of our business proven over time that allows us to reconfirm low double-digit EPS growth for the year by continuing to do what we do best, applying the principles of value creation to manage our business in a way that optimizes economic returns by focusing on the right combination of value levers in any given situation. With that, I've finished my presentation and I'll now be happy to take your questions. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Operator Thank you. We will now poll for question from analysts.

Pre-Close Conference Call The pre-close statement doesn't give us much of the detail on the factors underlying the profit trends in Q2, and I think by implication, if you're talking about flat first half, you're talking about EPS down sort of ballpark 4% in Q2. Could you talk us through the factors, which are giving rise to that result, particularly what's happening to A & P spending in the quarter? Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations Yeah, I mean, let me try and run through some of the building blocks. The first factor in quarter 2 is the retail de-stocking issues that we've seen particularly in Home & Personal Care in North America. If you put that together with the [weak] count of home channels and also the accounting change that comes from the go-to-market in North America, then we see that operating profits is off by around 120 to 140 million in the second quarter. Now, by their nature, those are issues that, as in the case of go to-markets, are one off because we have changed the business model. In the case of retailer de-stocking, as we said, they have largely come to an end, and we also see some pickup in -- certainly in Foodservice channel, although prestige continues to be weak. We haven't backed off any of the key innovation programs that we've got in place. We're confident about the plans that we've got, we're confident about the innovations that we have got in the marketplace, and we're backing them with the appropriate amounts of investment. There will be an increase in A & P in the second quarter. You should expect, however, that will be at a lower rate than we saw in the first quarter, because the first quarter came up against an easy comparator from quarter 1 of 2002. The major investments in the A&P, as I said, is going behind the innovations, particularly in the hair and deodorant categories, and I think the track record in those categories speaks for itself. You know also that we have never specifically -- well, we've tried to avoid going into the specifics of a number for the quarter at the time of pre-close. I'd rather wait to actually have the full quarter's numbers in, but there is, as I say, an increase in the A&P spend rate. Most importantly, within the context of the overall development to margin, there's the continued momentum in our cost savings programs. And I hope that I brought out that clearly as well, that we're seeing both the benefits in the restructuring programs and that global procurement is still delivering and is delivering at a faster rate than we saw or that we mentioned with the quarter 4 results of last year. Julian Hardwick - ABN Amro Bank - Analyst Ok. Thanks for that. Can you give us any indication what you expect EBIT margins to do in Q2? Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations I'd expect them to be flat against last year. Julian Hardwick - ABN Amro Bank - Analyst And can you just give us some sense as to in terms of framing your guidance, what assumptions you've made about how June is going to pan out relative to a sort of normal June experience? Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations You mean you're looking at weather? Julian Hardwick - ABN Amro Bank - Analyst Well, among other things. 5 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Pre-Close Conference Call Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations I mean, we -- the process that we go through is that we've got the two months in house, we've got a full cost from the business, and in respect to our ice cream business, we would have a normal weather pattern factored into that forecast. Now, it's also important to actually look at that relative to last year, because if I remember from last year, I think ice cream in Europe had growth of something like certainly in high single digits or maybe it was in mid single digits in Europe in June month. So the forecast is based around a normal month, and there is a higher comparator in the last year for the June month. Julian Hardwick - ABN Amro Bank - Analyst Thanks a lot, Howard. Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations Okay Julian thanks. Operator Your next question comes from Julia Bannon of BNP Paribas Bank. Please go ahead. Julia Bannon - BNP Paribas Bank - Analyst Good afternoon. Howard, it is Julia here. Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations Hi Julia. Julia Bannon - BNP Paribas Bank - Analyst Hi, Howard I wonder if you can flesh out in two areas. In HPC, now, in the first quarter, you did indeed mention that there was softer amount in travel channels from prestige, but perhaps you could put a bit of extra color on that in terms of just how bad the demand is relative to 2002, and whether -- it sounds like the situation has actually got worse in Q2 verses Q1. And secondly, where you actually mentioned about trade de-stocking in the US, because I think this is a point that we all made last year -- sorry -- last quarter, was that the comment in terms of the Foods performance and de-stocking almost seemed to be entirely, as far as food was concerned, but there seems to be a of a sort of de-stocking emphasis shifting towards HPC now as well. Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations Ok. Let me try and go through those. I mean, they have indeed been a pickup in the rate of slowdown in prestige. In the first two months of the quarter, we have been looking at underlying sales declines in the region of 20%, so that's April and May and if I look at the year-to-date figures, there's a decline in the underlying sales growth just in double digits so it's definitely an acceleration in what we have seen in the underlying sales growth for prestige and the majority of that is actually coming in the second quarter. In respect to the other issue, I think there was certainly two separate points, and I more than likely didn't explain it well enough in the last conference call. 6 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Pre-Close Conference Call There was a planned change to do with our Foods business in the strategy for its go-to-market operations. That has gone exceptionally well, and was-- there was an impact of customers' orders getting phased over from the first quarter into the second quarter, that was fully built into our plans and considered in terms of the overall growth number for our Foods operations in North America. And the reason for that phasing was that we were changing over to a performance-based system, which was whereby our retail partners accrue the benefits of promotional dollars as we ship the goods. By the way, because it's accrued on shipping, that accounts for the accounting change. So that was always in our plan, and if I gave the impression that that was one of the issues behind the de-stocking, then I apologize for that, because the more important issue, which I think came out in the Q & A, was that, in fact, the major part of the unexplained or the unexpected de-stocking was in Home & Personal Care and that was related to some of the major retailers taking action to reduce inventory primarily because we see much lower overall growth rates in those categories than historically we have seen. I mean, our information that we have here shows that the Home & Personal Care categories are growing on average around about 1.5%. That's the track record through the first part of this year. That is significantly below the historic growth rate. If we look at our retail sales, which we also collect information on, then our retail sales, either stuff going off the shelves in the retailers, have been growing above the category growth rates, have been growing around at about 2%. However, if we look at the pattern of what's happening on the sales that we report to the market, i.e., our sales into the retail chain, that's where we've seen this de-stocking effect. And that is the equivalent around about -- all together, around about Euro 120 million of sales coming out of inventory. And it is mainly a Home & Personal Care issue. It's the Home & Personal Care issue that is different to our plans, and it is not a foods issue that makes it different to our plans. The Foods issue was considered within our plans, and, in fact, if anything, has gone at least as well as we expected. Julia Bannon - BNP Paribas Bank - Analyst Ok. And Howard, just to finish up, if I may, on the leading brand growth and the split of the 3%, bearing in mind obviously what the contents of the statement and what you've just said, if we were to hazard a guess for the split, would it be something like the Q1 split for 2002, 3.5 for Home & Personal Care and 2.6 for Foods? Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations Yeah, that's - Julia Bannon - BNP Paribas Bank - Analyst That's the order of magnitude? Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations Yeah. Julia Bannon - BNP Paribas Bank - Analyst Ok. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from Victoria Buxton of (inaudible). Please go ahead. 7 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Pre-Close Conference Call Victoria Buxton - Analyst Yes, good afternoon, Howard. I was just wondering if you could actually spit out the HPC number between Home Care and Personal Care? The 3.5 that Julia referred to -- Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations Yeah, I can give a very trite answer which is it's going to be faster in Personal Care than it is in home care. One of the one of the effects we've got within Home Care in the quarter is that the effect of the repositioning of the laundry portfolio. If I look at Personal Care to date in the quarter, then that's -- then I would estimate that Personal Care will be running at around about 4 to 4.5% in the second quarter. It could possibly be a bit above that. I've just given you that number including Prestige. I have to back out the Prestige number. Let me just do a slightly more complicated -- I would think Personal Care was up more towards 5% and the difference on that relative to the previous performance that we have seen consistently over a number of quarters is primarily coming out of the trade de-stocking issues in Home & Personal Care North America. Victoria Buxton - Analyst Ok. And then can you indicate where your A & P focus was in the quarter in terms of the split of the business as well, whether it was more towards Personal Care again or whether there was a step up in Foods? Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations I mean, the majority of the A & P increase did go behind, as I said, the categories of hair and deodorants. It also obviously included within that some [silk] in Europe, [Dove] hair in North America, continued rollout of various hair innovations in Asia and Latin America. There was also investment behind a number of innovations that we've got in the Foods area, and including, if I go to Europe, I can look in the dressings area and in Knorr, we're seeing good growth in Knorr and Hellmann's in Europe. So it's not exclusively limited to the Personal Care categories. There's also support behind a pickup that we've seen in the Foods growth. Victoria Buxton - Analyst More in Foods than we saw in Q1? Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations Yeah. There's a better growth profile to Foods in quarter 2, although part of that needs to be recognized as to do with the bounce that we've seen from Easter. I mean, and if we look at the sort of growth that we were getting in April from the Easter bounce, as it's called, then in spreads, we were seeing growth of over 7%, dressings over 10%, ice cream of 15%, and those are April figures. In North America, spreads, dressings, olive oil all recorded substantial growth increases and confirmed the Easter bounce that we had talked about previously. Victoria Buxton - Analyst Could I just -- what's the degree of --attrition compared to Q2? Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations We have seen in two months, the first month was 4% and the second month was 8%. 8 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Pre-Close Conference Call Victoria Buxton - Analyst Ok. Thanks very much. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from Mr. John McMillin of Prudential Securities. John McMillin - Prudential Securities, Inc. - Analyst Howard, did you give a breakdown between volume and price in the quarter? Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations No, I didn't, but it's around half of the leading brand growth is in price. That's around 150 basis points. John McMillin - Prudential Securities, Inc. - Analyst Ok. And in terms of the fact that you just highlighted this HPC business in Chicago, you know, I guess I'm not an expert on Home & Personal Care, but for the business to have such a hiccup, if you want to call it, and to have highlight it, I guess I didn't really have a feel that it was that type of de-stocking going on. Can you just quantify, of the slowdown in Home & Personal Care, what percent of it came from inventory de-stocking? I miss missed it. Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations Yeah I mean, if I look across our business, then in HPC, it's around about 230 basis points on HPC growth is coming from retailer de-stocking. --And, I mean, in some ways--, you know, the reason that it's actually happening in North America does stem from these lower category growth rates that we're getting, and clearly stated strategies, financial strategies of retailers to only allow increases in inventory at below their rates of sales increase. John McMillin - Prudential Securities, Inc. - Analyst But it doesn't reflect any kind of loading pattern in past sales efforts by you? Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations No -- it does reflect that we had too high a stock in the trade. One of the things that we have extended VMI-type initiatives, Vendor Managed Inventory, we get a much better tracking now between sales in, sales out in terms of the distribution centers. I mean, sort of the sophistication of the systems at the store does not, is still not sufficiently accurate, but I think that that shows that there is no discernible pattern of loading. There's a natural rhythm that obviously goes on with innovation cycles, but it's something that we monitor, and our trade stock levels were too high relative to what the retailers were trying to do. 9 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Pre-Close Conference Call John McMillin - Prudential Securities, Inc. - Analyst Yeah, I just -- you know, again, I know it was a sensitive time to have a meeting. You know, you just can't come out at that meeting and unveil what's going on in the market, but just to, how you could have six guys stand up there and get no feel for the fact that this kind of level of de-stocking was going on is surprising. And that's just more a comment than a statement. Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations No that's okay. I mean, I think that's part of what I said to Julia, was that I thought that at the time of the Q1 conference call, when we were explaining issues to do with our performance in Q1, that we did bring out that there were several impacts in terms of trade de-stocking, and that the ones in Foods were known and were in our plans, and that there was a series of things happening in Home & Personal Care which had not been considered in our plan. And I thought that I had brought that out as being an issue during the Q1 conference call, but it's clear from your comments and from those of Julia that I didn't bring them out. John McMillin - Prudential Securities, Inc. - Analyst Well, maybe I missed it so. Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations No, no, no. I mean, if two of you are saying it, then there's something wrong with what's going on. And it does impact, -- you know, I mean, it's 30 basis points at the end of the day, which is either significant or not significant on its own, it would have been something that, you know, normally we would just manage, it's just when it gets combined with Slim Fast and some other issues that it pushes us outside our comfort zone in terms of the headroom that we actually have within the planning system. In terms of the actual Chicago event itself, then I think one of the things that we try to make sure is that these are about highlighting global capability that were got in the business and not about a specific geography where we're actually sitting, and we're specifically not anything to do with the quarter's results. And again, I hopefully made that clear. And we weren't talking about, you know, the Home & Personal Care business North America's performance. We're talking about what we were doing globally in hair and deodorants and in our laundry strategy. John McMillin - Prudential Securities, Inc. - Analyst Thanks a lot. Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations Ok. Thanks, John. Operator Thank you. Next question comes from Mr. James Edwards Jones of Credit Suisse First Boston. James Edwards Jones - Credit Suisse First Boston - Analyst Two questions, if I may, Could you just sort of expand a bit more on the food business? And it looks as though that will have grown leading brands by about a percent and a half for the first half as a whole, which we see excludes all the Easter effects and calendar effects. And what's going on there? Because that, there does seem to be a maturity lower rate of growth than I guess even we'd expected. 10 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Pre-Close Conference Call Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations The number that you've got is right, but don't forget there's also one fewer trading day in the first half of the year. So if you remember the unique features of the Unilever calendar, then, you know, that accounts for a lower growth rate around about 50 basis points just on the pure phasing to do with the calendar. Slim Fast has a significant impact on the Foods business. I mean, it takes down the growth rate in the Foods business in the first half year by around about 120 basis points. The weakness in Foodservice and what I call out of home channels, which also includes sort of scooping ice cream, takes the growth down by around about 40 basis points. So, mathematically, yes, you're right, at 1.5, but there are some things generally that need to be considered, there are some very specific Unilever things such as Slim-Fast, and then there are changes that we have made specifically to improve the business infrastructure going forward. For example, go to market changes in Unilever Bestfoods North America. And that in its own right, just the changes to go to market also take about 50 basis points off the growth rate. So if you add all of those up, then yes, 1-1/2% is the number, but underlying - if you want to go underlying, underlying help us with the concept, but there's a more robust framework underneath that if you look at the core of the business. James Edwards Jones - Credit Suisse First Boston - Analyst I guess that goes someway to answering my second question, which is how can you be so confident that the business is going to grow by -- or the leading brands will grow by about 5% in the second half? It does seem and well clearly as basically as against much tougher comparisons and it looks now as if it's going to be against a materially lower A & P expense than it was in the second half of last year. So, there are some big new product initiatives in there that's going to turn that around in the second half, or is there something more to it than that? Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations First of all, let's try and get the math out of the way because, I mean -- and deal with the issue of tough comparators. In the second half of last year, we had leading brand growth of around 6.6%. That included one extra trading day in the fourth quarter. And if we adjust for that, then on a like for like basis, that was equivalent to just over 6%. Whilst thats at the top end of our growth range, it's by no means exceptional. And to achieve our full year target, we need to grow in the second half of this year by around 5%, and given that we have got one extra trading day, on a like for like basis, we actually need to grow, backing that out, by around 4.5%. If you bring it back the other way around and actually say well, what in the first half of the year is different and we look at the 3% growth rate, then in Foodservice, we've assumed a return to higher rates of growth, but still below those achieved in the second half of last year. In prestige, we've assumed that the impact of the business environment will continue for the rest of the year, and in respect of a number of impacts that we've seen that have held back sales growth in the first half, those were expected to have a much less significant in the second half. Those impacts are, we have implemented to a large part the Foods North America go to market initiative. And implementation plan has gone smoothly into plan. We believe very much at the end of the sharp reduction in inventories that we've seen principally in Home Personal Care North America. As I said earlier, market shares have remained stable, and our retail sales have been growing at around about 2% during that time. Slim-Fast performance in the first half has depressed the Unilever sales growth rate. And in the second half, we expect to see a progressive improvement as we benefit from innovation in the marketplace. And then the issue of the one trading day. If you add all of those together, you actually get to a difference of around about 280 basis points that should be looked at on top of the run rate in the first quarter. So, you know, sort of 5.5 to 6% looks like the run rate based on where we are in the first half of the year. That takes us into a figure of about 4% for the full year, and also gives us some headroom as we move forward to deal with things that are the normal cut and thrust of business. We have got a good innovation program going forward, and turning to the A & P issue, we see we see a flat to if not slightly higher level of A & P, and we see that A & P consistent with the over all figure that is we gave at the start of path to growth, which was for an increase of around 200 basis points, we said at the year-end results that we still had around about 80 basis points of A & P to go in the overall equation, a slight increase in 2003 is consistent with that overall positioning and where we expect to get to in terms of the overall path to growth program. 11 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Pre-Close Conference Call James Edwards Jones - Credit Suisse First Boston - Analyst What will the A & P spend since you've done in Q2, very roughly? Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations Very roughly, we would expect it to have gone up but not up as much as it did in quarter 1, which was up against an easy comparator from the prior year, and as I said earlier, to one of the answers, with an EBIT margin that's expected to be roughly flat year on year. James Edwards Jones - Credit Suisse First Boston - Analyst So it is right to seem it's going to be significantly lower in the second half? Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations Yeah -- well, lower than what? James Edwards Jones - Credit Suisse First Boston - Analyst Lower than the second half 2002. Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations Yeah, I'd I have to say that I do think there's sometimes an absolute obsession with quarterly numbers and what they're actually doing because, I mean, there's a set of programs that we're putting in place. Those are receiving the appropriate amount of investment behind the innovations and marketplace support. The exact phasing of that quarter by quarter is an interesting statistic, but it's the longer term trend that is more important. And it is consistent -- well, what we're doing in 2003 is consistent with the overall path of growth program. I won't pretend for a moment that, for example, in the case of prestige, we are likely not to be spending as much in prestige as we first planned. I mean, it's a different marketplace to the one that we started off in. If you are getting the growth of so-called smart shopper value propositions, those have got a different overall margin structure in terms of where they are than in some other brands. And our job is just to make sure that we keep the consumer, you know, sort of full square in the frame of what we're doing and make sure that we actually focus on delivering what is relevant to them. So yeah, there are always changes as we work our way through the year. But in terms of overall A & P spend, then we are putting, as I said, the same or expectation of slightly more into the market, and that is consistent with the overall framework that we gave at the time of path to growth, was first announced. James Edwards Jones - Credit Suisse First Boston - Analyst Ok. Thanks, Howard. Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations Thanks, James. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from Hayward Rick of ING Financial Markets. Please go ahead, sir. 12 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Pre-Close Conference Call Hayward Rick - ING Financial Markets - Analyst Hello. Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations Hi. Hayward Rick - ING Financial Markets - Analyst Concerning the geographical development of the volume sales, is that-was that of the leading brand - was that comparable to what happened in the first quarter, so meaning negatives in the mature markets and positives in the emerging markets? And on Slim-Fast on -- about the development, does it mean that it's again weak in the second quarter, that it is a disappointment against earlier expectations? And maybe you can elaborate on what kind of marketing sales decline you expect in the second half, how many basis points. Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations Yeah, I mean the--, by geography, then-- I think it's clear from the comments, I made already that the North American number will not show a significant improvement compared to the first quarter. We still expect to see an underlying sales decline largely driven by Slim Fast and by the trade de-stocking in HPC North America. We expect a more positive performance in Europe, and we're looking for positive underlying sales growth, and in our D & E regions, we'd also expect there to be the positive trends that we've been seeing over the last few quarters. In terms of the investment in A & P, I think, you know, again, I think it's just more appropriate that we actually wait until we've got the full quarter's results for me to comment on the specifics of the quarter. I've given an indication of where we stand for the full year, and I really don't see as much value added by me speculating further on what might happen in the second quarter. It's consistent with the overall plan for the year. And I think we do have to remember that this is a trading update, it's pre-close, it's two months' figures, and I'll have the real numbers, as they say, when I talk to you the next time. Hayward Rick - ING Financial Markets - Analyst And Slim Fast, is that - Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations Oh, yes, sorry, Howard. I think Slim Fast -- if we go back, there were three separate issues that we talked about last time. One was to do with the promotional planning and timing. The second was to do with the consumer trend towards low carb diets, and the third issue was to do with the phasing of innovation. We have sorted out the promotional planning and timing issues in terms of the way that we actually structure ourselves and approach the retailers. The innovations that we talked about in terms of soups, pastas, a selection of different bars, including a new zero sugar or low carb snack bar, and the development of a soy-based RTD, those are going into the marketplace as we speak, but we're -- we'll really feature in Q3's results, and we also had Slim Fast ice cream going in, which is going well. In terms of the overall sales growth for the second quarter, then we're seeing a similar level of decline that we saw in quarter 1, a small improvement if you include the ice cream benefiting within the numbers, but again, I think that we said that the important thing was that we saw the improvement throughout the rest of the year and that we expected to see a much stronger position as we exited the year. The plan is dependent upon the success of the innovations and the success of advertising and PR campaigns in respect to the appropriateness of our solution with the consumers as opposed to other solutions that the consumer might want to use.

Pre-Close Conference Call so not withstanding the rate of sales decline, we are still very much the clear dominant leader in the category, and that gives us the strength to make the innovations stick with both the retail partners and in terms of the amount of advertising that we put behind them. So the key elements of the plan are in place, but we're going to have to watch this develop over the rest of the year to see whether or not that has been fully successful. Hayward Rick - ING Financial Markets - Analyst Thank you. Operator Thanks, your next question comes from Mr. Kavlov (inaudible). Please go ahead. Unidentified Good afternoon. First of all, just - I understand well that we saw a recovery at the ice cream compared to Q1, which was very weak. Is that also at Ben and Jerry's ice cream? And my second question is I still have some problems in that you still reconfirm your year target because EPS will be flat in the first half year, and you still believe on yearly basis at least 10% percent profit growth, that means that you would have a fantastic second half of the year. Do you really need a strong recovery of the economy for that? Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations In terms of the ice cream question, then our business in North America has been performing well in marketplace terms. By that, I mean market share terms. Good Humor-Breyers business is showing good business in retail growth. However, both them, Ben and Jerry have been hit somewhat by weak sales in out of home channels, so for example, scooping shops or parlors. So good performance in Good Humor-Breyers and a weaker performance where we have those out of home channels. In terms of Europe, we saw a very strong performance in April. We saw a weaker performance in May, and June is, we'll just have to wait and see. The important part about the ice cream in Europe was that we did indeed see the so-called Easter bounce with underlying sales growth in April of 15%, but that was weaker by the time or by the May month was considerably weaker than that. We actually saw an underlying sales decline in the May month. Together, April and May, they look -- they look okay, as the basis for moving into the main season, which after all, is June, July, and August. So we really do need to wait to see what happens in June. In terms of the EPS forecast for the rest of the year, then there are a couple of issues again that I think need to be focused on. One of them is that there was a very strong EPS growth in the first half of last year, and, therefore, it was producing or is producing uneven comparators. Against that, there was a relatively high level of advertising promotion spend in the latter part of last year, as we had very much a back-end-phased advertising innovation program, partly because we were still in the first half of the year going through the best foods integration. The third fact is that in the first half of this year, we have EPS dilution from known disposals, which are around 3% in the first half year, primarily the disposals of Diversey, Lever and Mazola, and they drop out in the second half of the year, so there's very little dilution expected from known disposals in the second half. And then the last point is -- well, I should then add in that we're actually seeing an improving trend in D & E markets from margin structure in terms of the recovery of devaluation-led cost increases that we've been able to recover through pricing action, and then the last point is that in the first half of the year, we've got the number of one-off or short-term factors that have reduced EPS in the first half year, and those include the unusual level of trade de-stocking, the introduction of the go-to-market change in North America. If I take all of those one-off or short-term factors into account, they've impacted operating profit by around about Euros 130 to 150 million, which is equivalent to some eight percentage points of EPS growth in the half year. So to do the plan for the full year, it doesn't require there to be any change in the economy or whatever as you expressed it. It does require us to continue to deliver the savings programs, and we've got a good track record of delivering the savings programs. It does require us to deliver the benefits that there are in terms of global procurement, and again, our record on that is first class. 14 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Pre-Close Conference Call And in the second half, there will not be the one-off factors that have impacted the first half of the year. I have to say that also our track record of delivery over the last three years points to the fact that we are confident about the plans we've got for earnings delivery over 2003, and that we've got the operating plans to do that. Unidentified Thank you very much. That was very important to me. Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations Ok. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from Ms. Anne Gillen of Lehman Brothers. Anne Gillen - Lehman Brothers - Analyst Hi Howard. If you could go back to the 1.5% that you're seeing for the category growth for HPC North America? And just flesh out for us what channels you're tracking to get that 1.5? Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations Yeah, I mean, it's what we would call the six channels. So it includes dollar clubs, normal retail. Let me think what else? I need to get a piece of paper in front of me, I think. IRI, for example, normally covers 2 and 1/2 channels. What IRI normally misses, which is around 50% of category sales, is it ignores warehouse club and dollar stores, which are all showing record growth, and, of course, we also get a pickup of Wal-Mart data. So where we talk about that, we're getting a 95% coverage of our HPC business for the basis of that calculation. Anne Gillen - Lehman Brothers - Analyst Ok. That's helpful. And then just basis of comparison, can you tell us what it was running in the first quarter? What the same six-channel measurement was? Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations Well, there's very little difference, Anne, than we've actually seen over the course of 2003. I mean, historically, it's been growing at 3.5% to 4%. I mean, our actual plan as we entered the year was for growth much more in line with the historic levels, and that's why we call this a sharp -- there's been a sharp de-stocking. Year-to-date, I have to say that we're picking up -- year-to-date for total North America --sorry -- total HPC North America, the same number, 1.5%. Anne Gillen - Lehman Brothers - Analyst Great. That's helpful. And then you did talk about having moved to more vendor-managed inventory, and I'm wondering if that also played a role in your year-to-date and kind of if that phase-in might have accelerated some of this in the period through the end of May. 15 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Pre-Close Conference Call Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations I think -- I mean, we've been using vendor managed inventory techniques for quite some time. I mean, we use it around about -- or we get VMI coverage in around about 60% of our inventory that's out there. So -- I was trying to think of a clever way of saying it, but it's actually 60% of the stock, the inventory is actually covered by that. What we've been far more able to do recently is to actually get a clearer linkage between selling out data in the retail channel and matching that to our own selling-in data and triangulating that with the VMI. So we're getting a much better integration right across the supply chain so that you're actually more responsive to the demand signal. And it would be wrong of me to try and attribute any of that into VMI. I mean, at the end of the day, what VMI is quite clearly designed to do is to reduce the amount of inventory within the total supply chain. I mean, all of us and the retailers that we actually work with want to have very, very efficient business systems. But it would be wrong to try -- well, I'd be extrapolating from thought to fact, which would be wrong to say that VMI was part of it. What is interesting, though, is that we take a lot of the learning from what we're doing in North America, rolling that out in -- D & E markets, and also that's been an integral part of what we're doing within Foods go-to-market where we've actually got a lower coverage at the moment covered by VMI systems. Anne Gillen - Lehman Brothers - Analyst Terrific. Thank you. Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations Thanks, Anne. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from Mr. John Parker of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. John Parker - Deutsche Bank - Analyst Hello, Howard. Couple of margin questions. Is there any swing in associated costs behind the evolution of margins in the second quarter on the one hand, and second, you said margins flashes overall. Can you give any indication of how that performance is in food, household and personal and three separate units? Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations In terms of the associated costs, John, I think in the prior year, it was around about Euros 40 million of associated costs and we wouldn't see that as being much different in this quarter, quarter 2 2003. So no swing in associated costs. In terms of the overall margins for the various parts of the business, then I wouldn't say that there's anything stunningly -- that sticks out about the margins except to say that we're seeing the improvement that we would want to see within home care, and that in Personal Care, the margin looks relatively lower than the historic levels because of the higher A & P that is going behind Personal Care to support the longer-term position of that business and the phasing of it. So, Foods, relatively little difference to prior year, improvement in home care, and A & P in Personal Care producing a lower than you might have seen in the last few quarters. John Parker - Deutsche Bank - Analyst Ok. Thanks. And just back on sales growth, obviously you've indicated leading brands. Have I missed this? Have you given an indication of underlying total Unilever growth in the quarter? 16 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Pre-Close Conference Call Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations No, I didn't, but I'll answer that question. I would expect that to be around about 2% underlying sales growth. And I'll just give you the net effect of disposals net positions would be to reduce sales by around Euros 450 million in the quarter, and operating profit by around Euros 50 million. John Parker - Deutsche Bank - Analyst Ok. And cost savings overall, I mean, running around -- I mean, I think sort of 200 basis points was what we saw in the first quarter if you take cost savings and price changes and so forth, which -- is that still about the right level, similar level in Q2? Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations I'm not sure I can answer that question. What I can say is that the savings programs themselves are continuing to deliver what we expect them to do, that there's a faster progress on both the general restructuring savings and in the overall procurement. I think I'll have to wait until I actually get to the full quarter to see the overall number because we've obviously got some impact of lower sales from de-stocking have any impact in operating profit on the way you know, on the basis that I'm already explained. John Parker - Deutsche Bank - Analyst Yeah. Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations I think the other thing that's important to remember, as I said, with the first quarter results was that there's always some lumpiness in overhead savings, I mean so there was a very large number, as far as I remember, in overheads in quarter 1, and I warned at that time that people shouldn't expect to just extrapolate that number throughout the rest of the year. That will continue to be lumpy as we -- as some of these things just happen because there are large projects that allow headcount to lever a certain point and that has a disproportionate effect in any one quarter. But the shape of the overall program, the shape of the overall savings programs and the totals within path to growth are intact. The only other thing I have been saying that developing in emerging markets, I've said that we are seeing some recovery in gross margins through the pricing action and that there's been some stabilization of currencies in key markets that we've been seeing, and we would, therefore, expect to start seeing some of the benefits of that. But again, that's particularly in the second half of the year. We're seeing it in quarter 2, but the full benefit is there in the second half of the year. John Parker - Deutsche Bank - Analyst Thanks, Howard. Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations Thanks, John. Operator Thank you, sir. Your next question comes from Florence Tash (ph) -- of MSS. Please go ahead. 17 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Pre-Close Conference Call Florence Tash - MSS - Analyst Hi, Howard. Just going back to the top line, when we had the first quarter call, you said the leading brands were up only 3% versus your long-term target of 5-6%, and basically 200 basis points of the short fall was coming from Easter and one less trading day split about 50/50. So I guess the expectation was that, you know, given that you have the same number of trading days this quarter and then Easter is coming back, you would have had naturally a 200 basis point down versus Q1. So as the de-stocking getting that much worse that it's actually completely offset that positive impact you were supposed to have? Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations No, I think that, you know, we've never got into the business of the quarterly sales forecast. We certainly didn't get any guidance for the quarterly phasing of our plans. What we did say was that we would expect to see the Easter bounce, and that, we did see. The extra trading day, just to remind everyone, actually comes back in quarter 4 of this year. Florence Tash - MSS - Analyst Right, but the underlying in Q1, you should take out the effect for 5% to 6%. So even though the trading day is going to be 100 basis points extra benefit in the last quarter, you know, versus the first quarter, you should have still, you know, gotten back to your underlying level of growth. Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations We have continued to see some of the features in the first quarter, which were the further de-stocking, particularly in HPC, North America. If anything, a pickup in the weakness of Prestige, as I've already explained to a previous question, the Foodservice channel continued to be weak. There was no immediate pickup after the end of the situation in the Middle East. And Slim Fast has continued. Florence Tash - MSS - Analyst But these were -- my point is that these were issues you were facing already in the first quarter. Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations Yes, and we entered into the second quarter with a plan, which still allowed us to -- still had the headroom to absorb some of these issues. What we see with the May results is that we have used up the headroom that we had, and hence it's necessary to reposition the overall outlook. Within any business, you're always going to get some good news and some bad news, and at the moment, the issues are going against us, and we can only deal with the reality of the numbers that we've got. Florence Tash - MSS - Analyst So - Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations I could sit here and speculate about a wonderful summer, but I'm not going to do that. 18 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Pre-Close Conference Call Florence Tash - MSS - Analyst I'm not asking you to do that. I guess the other thing is, you said in Q4 that, you know, you had 8.5% growth in the leading brands in Q4, but some of that was due to an extra trading day in Q4 last year, is that correct? So that the underlying was only 6%? Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations I said that there certainly was an extra trading day in Q4, what I said was -- that would get you to something like 7.5% for the -- for Q4. Florence Tash - MSS - Analyst That's Q4 2002, right? Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations 2002, yeah. And what I said was that if you actually looked at the second half of last year, that the growth rate after allowing for that extra trading day was at 6% in the second half, which was at the top of our range, is by no means exceptional. We had 5.4%, if I remember rightly, in quarter 3 of 2002, we had 8.5%, which included the one extra trading day, and it averaged out at a little over six and a half, which you then adjust for the trading day, takes you down to 6% like for like in the second half of last year. Florence Tash - MSS - Analyst And then in terms of the de-stocking in the U.S., the other thing that's very surprising is that, you know, at the same time, you're saying this, you're launching, you know, shampoos and deodorants, which, you know, should be in stocking phase at this stage. So I really don't understand which products are getting de-stocked. Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations I mean, I'm not going to go through line item by line item, but, you know, there certainly are -- there's more Dove shampoo and there's more Axe that is sitting out there and there's more conditioner, but in aggregate, retailers are taking down inventory levels, and that will always be a mix across a variety of brands in any category. So I think they're almost two separate points. One is what is happening within the overall portfolio of the brands, and the second is what is actually happening in terms of the overall inventory levels in the trade. I mean, at the end of the day, our shares are stable in Home & Personal Care in North America. We've got a gain in Personal Care, and we've got a slight decline in Home Care. The slight decline in Home Care is made up of around about 120 basis points on laundry, offset by gains in fabric conditioners and in Personal Care, our shares are up by around about 60 basis points in aggregate. Florence Tash - MSS - Analyst All right. That's what I wanted to ask you. Thank you. Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations Thanks, Florence. 19 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Pre-Close Conference Call Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from John David Rogue of (inaudible) John David Rogue - Analyst Hello, Howard this is John David. Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations Hi John David. John David Rogue - Analyst I have three small questions. Let me start with the first one. Did I understand it correct that 2002 had one trading day more than 2001? And second question is, can you elaborate a bit on the new go-to-market approach in North America and why this is costing Unilever Euros 50 million, and do you expect these costs to come back in the second half of the year? And then the last one, the trade de-stocking in the U.S., Home & Personal Care. Did you lose or I mean did Unilever lose shelf space at the number of important retailers? Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations In total, for the year, then there are no difference in the number of days. What it was in quarter 4 2002, there is an extra day relative to quarter 4 of 2001. John David Rogue - Analyst Ok. Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations But in total, I mean, I'd have to go and look where the leap years are because that obviously gives another element of confusion, but quarter 4 on quarter 4, there's no -- it's not a total of the year, it's just within the quarters. If I look at the go-to-market situation in Foods North America, what actually happened was as we - we were changing the go-to-market strategy in our Foods business in North America, and we're moving to one where they accrue promotional dollars on the basis of shipments, so it's a performance-based scheme. The date of implementation of that was the first of April of this year. Retailers, therefore, did not order at the back end of March because they were able, or they knew that they would start earning promotional dollars from the first of April. So there was a holdback of their orders at the end of the first quarter that reduced sales by an amount of money and we have made no assumption that those sales come back. We plan that that is an effective improvement in the overall efficiency of the extended supply chain. As we move to the system of this new go-to-market strategy, we also have to reflect that in the way that we actually do the accounting for those promotional dollars because they are earning the dollars on shipments, the correct way of doing the accounting is to accrue for those promotional dollars. So shipment goes out of the door, somebody has earned a dollar, and we have implemented the accrual in the second quarter results. And together, those have reduced Unilever operating profit by the equivalent of around Euros 50 million in the first half of the year. So it's not a loss to Unilever. It just reflects the way that we're actually changing our strategy for go-to-market and reflects a change in the accounting because we would expect to end up with a more efficient way of actually interfacing with our retailers -- 20 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Pre-Close Conference Call John David Rogue - Analyst I understand, but did you not you're usually pay these allowances in the fourth quarter, so by accruing these now, does that mean that you'd have to pay less in Q4? Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations I mean, we're currently accruing for the trade funds at the time of shipment rather than the time of promotion. There may well be a change in timing, but at the moment, that is a reflection of what is actually happening within this quarter, and the only reason I mention it is to try and actually explain what is happening between the second quarter or second half year and the first half year. John David Rogue - Analyst Ok. And the last question - Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations So -- now let me just be clear. I mean, we do not intend to have increased the overall amount of money that Unilever is putting behind promotional spend in the North American market, so it could well be some timing issues, but they'll get resolved over the timing and re-phasing of the promotions, and it's not something that I can reflect actually within the second quarter results. The second quarter results have to reflect the timing of the accounting and the taking of that accrual. There will be benefits as we go forward, but those are going to be phased over the actual execution of the promotional plan, so there won't be some other large sum of money that comes back in at some other point in time because previously, we accounted for the promotion as we executed the promotion. Does that make sense? John David Rogue - Analyst Yes, it makes sense, and the last question, about the trade de-stocking and the shelf space that you occupy? Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations I mean, there are certain parts of the laundry portfolio where we have not got as much shelf space as we did have, although in the case of one particular brand, Whisk, you have to remember that that is a significantly stronger presence in the Northeast of the U.S. and down in the Southeast than it is in other parts of North America or U.S. landscape. So certainly in some of the weaker areas for Whisk, there's clear evidence of reduced [facings], but otherwise what we actually see through the overall maintenance of our market shares is that shares are stable in aggregate. And there's no indication of loss of spacing. John David Rogue - Analyst Ok. Thank you. Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations Thanks. 21 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Pre-Close Conference Call Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Andrew Wood of Sanford C. Bernstein & Company; Andrew Wood - Sanford C. Bernstein & Company - Analyst Three questions for you. Firstly, relating to your HPC business, basically Procter & Gamble came out and guided to 5 to 7% volume growth for their fourth quarter, which is equivalent to your second quarter, and mentioned or made no mention of trade de-stocking. You are saying there's trade de-stocking and you are holding your market share. There seems to be a bit of a disconnect there in terms of the messages. Secondly, in terms of pricing, I wonder if you could give us some more color behind that 1.5% pricing. Basically your pricing has come down from 3% last year to 2% in the first quarter now to 1.5%. Is that a trend that you anticipate continuing? And thirdly if I remember correctly in your year-end reporting, you basically said that you were planning to spend 100 basis points more of advertising and promo over the next two years, more or less split 50/50, so I think most of us assumed 50 basis points of advertising increase in 2003, now you're guiding to basically flat to small increase. Is this just not a case of cutting your A & P spend to meet your earnings target? Thanks. Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations Sure. I mean, let me start with pricing. I mean, one of the issues in respect to the pricing is that we actually have to look at what is going on in the tail of the business, and with the overall leading brands number, and that's a deliberate strategy to manage the tail of non-leading brands' value. It's almost worthwhile reflecting that in 2002, for example, 50% of the leading brand growth came from volume mix and 50% came from price. So there are some distortions in the way that can be -- that the pricing can be looked at just because of the implications of the impact of tail. In respect of the overall pricing equation, then I don't think that we have ever said anything other than at times pricing goes up, particularly in D & E markets as we recover the effects of devaluation in D & E markets with pricing adjustments necessary to preserve the margin structure after the health of the business. And at the same time, you're getting underlying volume decline. So we would expect as we go through the D & E recovery process to actually see pricing increases going -- or lessening in terms of their importance in the overall mix, and volume gains starting to become more important in terms of the overall mix. And if you go back to -- I mean if you actually go back and look in our history and go back over, you know, over the 1990's, then that's very much the picture that you would actually see, and is the background to why we've been able to grow our D & E business by an average of 9% through the 1990's with around about, I would guess, somewhere between 2 to 3 percentage points coming from price. So it's nothing that we've ever tried to say is any different in terms of the relative importance of price as we go through those sorts of cycles. In terms -- and that's why, I mean, in the way that we've discussed things with the market, we've actually tried to get the focus on underlying sales growth because we think that that actually reflects those sorts of trade-offs that are going on. In terms of what others might be saying, then I can only say what is going on in our business there is an emphasis in the way that others talk about the progress of their business on unit volumes or case volumes or whatever they want to describe it as. There's also potential benefits of people sitting there at the moment with dollar-based currency conversions. I can only say what's going on in our business. We see that level of trade inventory coming out, and I have to say that, you know, we've seen few -- we haven't seen too many people at the moment talking about the second quarter, so I think we have to see that unravel. We always talk about value shares. We don't talk about volume shares. We see a sustained performance of our PC/Personal Care business well ahead of the Personal Care business of the majority of our competitors, and in respect of household care, where there certainly have been some share losses in laundry, they are part of a deliberate strategy that is focused on actually improving the profitability so that we can actually put the-- funds -- the better margin structure behind innovations where we've got some advantage. If I look across the Unilever world, then in respect of the shares in North America, we do not see any overall share loss to Procter & Gamble.

Pre-Close Conference Call at the situation in Europe, then if I look in laundry, both Unilever and Procter & Gamble, and flat and Henkel have seemed to have gained a share point, particularly in their heartland, so I can only tell you what is the information that I have got here. In respect to the third question that you asked, we talked about a step-up in A & P of around about 80 basis points, if I remember rightly, at the time of the Q4 results. We did indeed say that it would be no problems for the purposes of modeling to take it and split it 50/50, and we continue to expect to see A & P at the same rate or slightly ahead in 2003. And we see that as being consistent with the overall progress and development of the business. There have been some changes in the plans that we've made for the reasons I gave earlier. I mean, in certain parts of the world, so-called value propositions are tending to do better at the moment, and we have brands in those mid tier positions and always have had brands in those positions. Prestige is a weak market, and we just see that as being fully consistent with, you know, living the reality of the marketplace. We don't see that there's any deviation from the intentions of getting sharper focus in our portfolios supporting those correctly. Andrew Wood - Sanford C. Bernstein & Company - Analyst Okay. Thanks. Howard Green - Unilever Inc. - SVP Investors Relations Thanks, Andrew. Operator That concludes our question and answer session. We will now pass back to Howard Green for his closing comments.

CORPORATE PARTICIPANTS Lawrence Sala Anaren Inc. - Chairman and President and CEO Joseph Porcello Anaren Inc. - VP Finance CONFERENCE CALL PARTICIPANTS Richard F. Valera Needham and Company - Analyst Dale R. Pfau CIBC World Markets - Analyst Greg Weaver Current Capital - Analyst Howard Horowitz Darmel Management - Analyst PRESENTATION Operator Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Anaren second quarter earnings release conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Larry Sala, President and Chief Executive Officer of Anaren, Inc. Please go ahead, sir. Lawrence Sala - Anaren Inc. - Chairman and President and CEO Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for participating in the Anaren fiscal 2003 second quarter conference call. I'm Larry Sala, I'm joined today by Joe Porcello, our Vice President of Finance. I'll provide a brief overview of the results of the second quarter ended December 31st, 2002, after which Joe will review, the financial highlights. We'll then take your questions. Statements contained in this conference call, which are not historical information, are forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed. You are encouraged to review Anaren's second quarter press release, our Anaren Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30th, 2002, and the Anaren Form 10-Q for this current second quarter ended December 31st, 2002, and exhibits to those reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to learn more about the various risks and uncertainties facing Anaren's business and the potential impact on our net sales and earnings. Net sales for the second quarter were $20.9m, up 25% from the second quarter of last year and up 1% sequentially from the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Operating earnings for the quarter were $2000 or approximately break-even compared to a $1.8m operating loss in the second quarter of last year and a $455,000 operating loss in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Net income for the second quarter was $475,000 or 2 cents per diluted share. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt and securities were approximately $127m at December 31st. During the first six months of the fiscal year the company generated $5.6m in positive operating cash flow, in part due to a $2.1m or 11% reduction in inventory as well as a $1.6m or 12% reduction in our accounts receivable. In our wireless group, net sales for the quarter were $13.1m, up 25% from the second quarter of last year and up 1% sequentially from the first quarter. The wireless market demand remains very weak and visibility remains poor. During the second quarter, demand was driven by network build-outs in China. Wireless group customer concentration for the quarter as a percentage of wireless group net sales was Ericsson at 17%, Motorola at 14%, Powerwave at 12% and Lucent at 11%. 2 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call We continued our aggressive wireless new product development activities, as demonstrated by the five new products that were introduced during the quarter. Of particular note are the low-cost mini-Xinger circulator, which is 75% smaller than the initial circulator that we introduced just nine months ago. This product offers excellent performance and is a very cost-effective solution for our amplifier customers. And the Xinger LNA, which is the latest active Xinger product offering, providing a balance, low-noise amplifier function in a low-cost miniature Xinger module configuration. Two transistors and the associated bias and matching circuitry are embedded in a Xinger package, offering our customers size, cost and performance advantages over the discrete implementations that are typically used. This product provides Anaren the opportunity to gain contact in base station transceiver applications. Our 802.11 product development and design activity also continues to progress well. During the quarter we continued to expand our 802.11 product offering and aggressively pursue new design wins. For our space and defense group, net sales for the second quarter were $7.6m. That's up 14% from the second quarter of last year and up 4% sequentially from the first quarter. Space and defense group new orders for the quarter were $5.9m and included follow-on orders for our ship-borne jamming subsystems as well as our precision location receivers for airborne applications. Space and defense backlog at December 31st, 2002, was approximately $29.7m. During the quarter we took further action to reduce our operating costs in light of the continued weak demand in the wireless market. We've reduced our global work force by more than 10% during the first six months of fiscal 2003 and continue to take steps to streamline our operations and reduce our overall operating expenses. Joe will now review the financial highlights. Joseph Porcello - Anaren Inc. - VP Finance Good afternoon. The financial highlights of the second quarter income statement and the balance sheet at December 31st are as follows. The gross profit margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2003 was 26.7%. This was a 30 basis point increase from gross margins of 26.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Gross margins rose on wireless products and fell slightly on space and defense products in quarter two. Margins rose on wireless products due to the increase in wireless sales and the cost reductions instituted in the first quarter. Space and defense margins fell due to a change in product mix with a higher level of military versus commercial space programs in the second quarter shipment mix. Going forward at current revenue levels and product shipment mix, we do not expect to see any significant change in gross margins. Investment in research and development was 7.3% of net sales in the second quarter of 2003, compared to 6.8% in the first quarter. Research and development expenditures have increased from the first quarter due to the application of additional engineering personnel to work on both new wireless land and wireless infrastructure component opportunities. Income from operations was at break-even in the second quarter of fiscal 2003 compared to a loss from operations of 2.2% of net sales in the first quarter of 2003. Operating margins increased in the second quarter due to the absence of any restructuring charge and the small improvements in second quarter gross margins. The company is reviewing all opportunities to reduce costs and will continue to implement cost saving measures. We presently do not expect significant improvements in operating income over second quarter 2003 levels without any increase in sales volume. Net income was 2.3% of net sales for the second quarter of 2003. This compares to .7% for the first quarter of fiscal 2003. On a per-share basis, diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2003 were 2 cents. This compares to 1 cent per diluted share in the first quarter. 3 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call The balance sheet highlights include the following. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were approximately $127m at December 31st, 2002, up $2m from June 30. We continued to enjoy a positive cash flow from operations in the first half of the year, despite the lower level of net income. Cash generated by operations was approximately $5.6m in the first six months of fiscal 2003 and came mainly from reductions in inventory and accounts receivable. Accounts receivable were $11.5m at December 31st, 2002, down $1.6m from June 30th. Day's sales outstanding at the end of December were 51 days compared to 56 days at June. We continue to expect days sales outstanding to fluctuate between 50 and 70 days as we go forward, depending on sales levels, customer mix and business conditions. Inventories at December 31st, 2002, were $18m, down $2.1m or 10.7% from $20m at June 30th, 2002. Capital equipment additions in the first half of fiscal 2003 amounted to approximately $3.6m. The additions were mainly for automated material handling equipment at Anaren Europe, test equipment at our Chinese operations and production equipment at our East Syracuse facility to support a new military satellite program. Accounts payable at December 31st, 2002, were $3.5m, down $1.5m from June 30th. This reflects the decline in materials purchases, which resulted in the current inventory reduction from the June quarter. During the first half of 2003, we purchased 71,800 treasury shares in the open market at an average cost of $8.27. It is anticipated we will continue to make open market purchases of treasury shares under the current board authorization depending on market prices. Relative to Celeritek, the company's original investment in Celeritek common stock averaged $8.47 a share and totaled $6.6m. This investment had a market value at December 31st, 2002, of approximately $5.2m, a $1.4m decline. The company considers this to be a temporary decline in market value and it has been recorded as a charge to other comprehensive income in the shareholders equity section of the balance sheet at December 31st. If at a future date this drop in market value is determined to be other than temporary, then the decline in value at that point in time, including the amount previously charged to equity, would at that time be recognized as a loss in the current period income statement. Lawrence Sala - Anaren Inc. - Chairman and President and CEO Thanks, Joe. Given the continued weak demand and limited visibility in the wireless market, we're projecting third quarter net sales to be in the range of $19m to $20m and diluted earnings per share to be in the range of a negative 1-cent to a positive 1 cent. We'll now take questions. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Operator Thank you.

Earnings Conference Call Lawrence Sala - Anaren Inc. - Chairman and President and CEO Hi, Rich. Richard F. Valera - Needham and Company - Analyst In terms of the stuff you guys are doing to reduce your costs, I understood that you were shifting the manufacturing, I think, of your isolators and circulators over to China. I'm just wondering how that's going and if that could result in some margin improvement as that phases in over the next quarter or so? Lawrence Sala - Anaren Inc. - Chairman and President and CEO Yeah, progress has gone basically to plan. We're in production over there. We are-- you know, we have to go through a process of qualifying with specific customers so we produce product and go through a qualification process. I'd say by the end of this quarter more than 50% of our ferrite product base production will be at our China operation as opposed to in our other facilities. And there certainly is-- will hopefully be, you know, a financial benefit to that. There certainly would be some head count reduction elsewhere as that product is moved or hopefully some additional production that we can bring in to replace it in these other operations. So that's progressing well. We really have not seen the benefit of that yet because of the fact that we're not fully qualified with all of our customers. We really have additional costs to date in place because we're producing in the two locations. It really won't be until our fourth quarter that we really start to see the economic benefits of that operation. Richard F. Valera - Needham and Company - Analyst Great. Now in terms of the 802.11 stuff, you mentioned you're continuing to pursue design wins. I think you had two last quarter. Is there any update to that or is there any prospects you can sort of highlight for further design wins? Lawrence Sala - Anaren Inc. - Chairman and President and CEO We have had additional design wins since our last quarter report. We haven't really talked about specific platforms yet and we probably won't until we actually start to see some firm uptake from our customers. So until we start to see more production-volume-oriented orders we'll probably refrain from talking about specific platforms. So that's gone well to our plan. Really our focus now is trying to expand that product line beyond just the balun function that we had initially introduced to try to, you know, offer higher levels of integration and hopefully more value to our customers and maintain or increase our dollar content. So we've started to beta sample customers with new products and probably before the end of this current quarter we'll be making some more announcements of new 802.11 products that we have in the market place. Richard F. Valera - Needham and Company - Analyst Great. And on the guidance of $19m to $20m and I think it's a loss to a penny, is there anything changing in-- It seems like the guidance on the bottom line is maybe a little conservative. Is there anything changing in the model, you know, anything that's sort of non-recurring or anything in the model that would cause it potentially to go to the loss there? 5 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Lawrence Sala - Anaren Inc. - Chairman and President and CEO No, it's-- I think if you look at it, if we really end up at the low end of our revenue range, in that $19m range, we'd be down almost $2m from this quarter and so being down that magnitude, even if we are able to execute on the cost reduction activities, we'd still struggle to do much better than that. So the real question is, where in that revenue range do we fall? We gave the same revenue guidance last quarter and ended up, you know, closer to $21m than we did to $19m, but China was a bit of a surprise to us and it's a very difficult market for us to predict demand for. So we benefited from that and it, you know, it was demonstrated by the strength from Lucent and the strength from Motorola that we saw last quarter, which we had not seen for probably the prior 18 months. And we have difficulty in saying how long and how robust this current China build-out will be. So I think that's really probably one of the bigger factors in where we end up in our revenue guidance. Richard F. Valera - Needham and Company - Analyst Sure. On the pricing pressure front, it's obviously been tough. Is there anything you can say about any kind of changes on the margin in the last quarter? Has it sort of stabilized? I mean, I'm assuming it's still pretty tough, but any-- any sort of trends or anything you can talk about on the pricing pressure front? Lawrence Sala - Anaren Inc. - Chairman and President and CEO Not-- no major changes. We're seeing, obviously, continued very aggressive pricing pressure from our customers. We are exiting some product areas that we just don't see an ability to make profitable contributors for us, so that will affect our revenue to some degree, we don't think significantly, but we have found it to be very challenging, even with moving product to other geographic locations, to be competitive and find it worth our while. So it continues, but it really hasn't changed dramatically or changed our margin forecast for the current quarter. Richard F. Valera - Needham and Company - Analyst Great. And just one last one. On Celeritek is there any update there? Have you sort of had any further interaction with them at this point? Or are you just kind of sitting back and seeing what happens here? Lawrence Sala - Anaren Inc. - Chairman and President and CEO No, there really has been no interaction since we last reported. Richard F. Valera - Needham and Company - Analyst OK. Thank you. Lawrence Sala - Anaren Inc. - Chairman and President and CEO Thanks. Operator Once again, please press star-one to ask a question at this time. We'll take our next question from Dale Pfau with CIBC World Markets. 6 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Dale R. Pfau - CIBC World Markets - Analyst Hi, Larry. Hi, Joe. Lawrence Sala - Anaren Inc. - Chairman and President and CEO Hey, Dale. Joseph Porcello - Anaren Inc. - VP Finance Hey, Dale. Dale R. Pfau - CIBC World Markets - Analyst A couple of questions here on what you're seeing and maybe you could help me. When you entered the December quarter -- and I'm going to talk specifically about the wireless group -- what percentage of that quarter did you have in backlog and firm commitments versus how much was in turns and then where are we relative to that position this quarter? Lawrence Sala - Anaren Inc. - Chairman and President and CEO I would say when we entered the quarter for the coming month-- You know, in any given month, going into the month we may have had something on the order of 40% visibility, I'll call it. It certainly wasn't firm orders, but it was forecasted demand from our customers and we were shipping as much as 50%-plus in a month that we don't have visibility of coming into the month. That's probably stayed fairly stable, maybe been a little stronger as we got into November, December and January because of the onset of demand out of China. Our customers gave us fairly firm forecasts for a couple of months because that build-out was well defined and they won, you know, solid contracts. Right now, we're kind of working our way through the end of most of that firm visibility and we're either, you know, would expect to see some new forecasted demand or start to see that demand fall off and it's really difficult for us to tell. So far it's hung in relatively well through January and probably the middle of February we have visibility to now, but we don't really have much beyond that, which has pretty much been status quo for the last 12 months. Dale R. Pfau - CIBC World Markets - Analyst Did I hear right, you said it's about that same way over the last 12 months? Lawrence Sala - Anaren Inc. - Chairman and President and CEO Yeah. November-December got better for us because of the demand out of China and it hung in there through now and as we look a month out from now, we have relatively good visibility because of the demand out of China. Prior to November we had, you know, even far more limited visibility than that. So, you know, for us, like I said, over the next six months I think the big driver for the upside will be that demand out of China hanging in there and following through. From what we understand, that build-out should last until, hopefully, the early part of this summer at a minimum. 7 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Dale R. Pfau - CIBC World Markets - Analyst And as a follow-on, what are your customers now telling you? Are they expecting their business to be about the same as it's been for the next 12 months as it filters down to you or are they-- and, excluding China, are they expecting any big, big movements one way or the other? Lawrence Sala - Anaren Inc. - Chairman and President and CEO No. You know, the November-December time frame is when we sit down with our largest customers and have our annual purchase negotiations where we try to-- they provide their business forecasts and we agree on annual pricing. And from that, the relative expectation appeared to be a very similar year in terms of total demand for the year. So it wasn't significantly up and it was not significantly down. You know, we'll see how it plays out and whether that ends up being reality, but the forecasted demand when we negotiated pricing was demand that was pretty similar to what we saw in 2002. Dale R. Pfau - CIBC World Markets - Analyst So would you consider it stabilizing or is it deteriorating any more? Lawrence Sala - Anaren Inc. - Chairman and President and CEO I'd say it's stabilizing. We've seen-- you know, obviously, we've reported three fairly consistent quarters in our wireless group. So for us to date it's been relatively stable and it's projected to stay this way and so the question will be, do they really meet those forecasts? Dale R. Pfau - CIBC World Markets - Analyst And the next question. Where are you seeing the most price pressure? You mentioned that, you know, there is some price pressure and you're exiting certain sub-segments. Certainly you're not exiting your Xingers. Are you seeing it in isolators? Are you-- You know, where specifically is it worse, Larry? Lawrence Sala - Anaren Inc. - Chairman and President and CEO Yeah. Well, you know, it's obviously worse in areas where there's the most-- you know, competitive offerings. The isolator business is a fairly competitive business. The resistive business is a very competitive business and even some of the custom assembly opportunities are fairly competitive these days. So it's not any-- We're not looking at exiting any product lines, it's just, you know, specific units where there are multiple suppliers on a drawing and the pricing has eroded to the point that we don't see the ability to see any contribution. We're stepping out of those opportunities. Dale R. Pfau - CIBC World Markets - Analyst And on a sort of a macro scale, you made kind of a run at Celeritek. You're still holding the shares. Do you have any long-term plans there? Lawrence Sala - Anaren Inc. - Chairman and President and CEO You know, it was something that, you know, our board is very engaged in and we discuss, you know, very, very regularly. There's obviously a lot going on at Celeritek and we think good reason to continue to wait and see how things resolve themselves. So, you know, it's still our board's desire to continue to maintain our position and interest. 8 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Dale R. Pfau - CIBC World Markets - Analyst And one last question. You know, given the state of the infrastructure market, has there been anyone-- has anyone approached you about a potential merger, either larger or smaller? Lawrence Sala - Anaren Inc. - Chairman and President and CEO No. We've really seen very little activity or interest, Dale, to be honest with you, either way. Either people interested in being acquired or people interested in getting into this margin and talking to us. So there just doesn't seem to be a lot of activity right now. Dale R. Pfau - CIBC World Markets - Analyst OK. Great, guys. Thanks for the call. Lawrence Sala - Anaren Inc. - Chairman and President and CEO Thank you. Operator Once again, please press star-one on your Touch-Tone telephone to ask a question. We'll move next to Greg Weaver with Current Capital. Greg Weaver - Current Capital - Analyst Hey, good quarter, guys. Lawrence Sala - Anaren Inc. - Chairman and President and CEO Thanks. Greg Weaver - Current Capital - Analyst Was Lucent salient on the wireless side? You mentioned Lucent as a top-- Lawrence Sala - Anaren Inc. - Chairman and President and CEO No, our Lucent business is directly with Lucent. Greg Weaver - Current Capital - Analyst What are they doing with your product? Is that back plane? 9 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Lawrence Sala - Anaren Inc. - Chairman and President and CEO We sell many different-- we'll call them custom assemblies or integrated components for various Lucent platforms, mainly cabinet-level power dividers or combiners and those types of products and, obviously, they've had some success in China and we've seen the benefit of that. So we don't reporting Salient as part of Lucent. Greg Weaver - Current Capital - Analyst Where did they show up? Lawrence Sala - Anaren Inc. - Chairman and President and CEO They show up as part of our-- we would report them as sales to Mandarin [ph]. Greg Weaver - Current Capital - Analyst Right. I meant in terms of percent. Lawrence Sala - Anaren Inc. - Chairman and President and CEO They don't show up as a meaningful customer, low percentages. I would venture to say 2%-3%. Greg Weaver - Current Capital - Analyst Even though they had a strong P/A quarter? The stuff they're shipping you're not in? Lawrence Sala - Anaren Inc. - Chairman and President and CEO Yeah, our content is just component-level products there. So not-- not a large customer for us in the quarter. Greg Weaver - Current Capital - Analyst OK. And on the defense side, you mentioned a new satellite job you were spending some money on to gear up for. Any color on that? Lawrence Sala - Anaren Inc. - Chairman and President and CEO Well, that's-- you know, we announced that we had won a development order about a year ago for our first military satellite program and we have competed aggressively to win the production side and so we've spent some money to try to position ourselves as best we could to be able to capture that production order, which we expect to happen within the next quarter or two. So our development activities have gone quite well and we've felt it was a capability we needed in order to be able to capture the production side of that contract.

Earnings Conference Call Lawrence Sala - Anaren Inc. - Chairman and President and CEO That's a contract of, I don't know, $3m to $5m sort of range. Greg Weaver - Current Capital - Analyst And are there any other opportunities on the military satellite side at this point? Lawrence Sala - Anaren Inc. - Chairman and President and CEO Not-- Yeah, there's some that we're pursuing, nothing that's on the near-term booking horizon, but we are-- you know, we are proposing and working with other customers in the military satellite area. So we're seeing activity, but nothing that we would expect to book between now and the end of the fiscal year. Greg Weaver - Current Capital - Analyst OK. Thanks. Operator And we'll take our next question from Howard Horowitz with Darmel Management. Howard Horowitz - Darmel Management - Analyst Hi, just following up on Celeritek, obviously this has been a long process. Have you given any consideration to, essentially, launching a proxy fight or making some shareholder proposals, beginning shareholder solicitation? It seems like the standstill has-- the agreement that they want you to sign has been the sticking point here, so I'm not sure how you get around it other than doing that and this-- you know, given the amount of cash in the company is higher than the market cap today, it would seem like this is a particularly good time to try to do that. Lawrence Sala - Anaren Inc. - Chairman and President and CEO Yeah, you know, we considered-- we continue to consider, you know, all of the options that we outlined in our 13-D and, you know, are looking at all our options and the appropriate timing of doing anything other than what we've done to date. So I don't really have a lot more to add. Howard Horowitz - Darmel Management - Analyst So is there a point in time at which a decision will be made about essentially going hostile? Lawrence Sala - Anaren Inc. - Chairman and President and CEO Can't really say. You know, there's a lot going on in the market place, a lot going on at Celeritek and we're looking at all those factors. Howard Horowitz - Darmel Management - Analyst OK.

Christos Cotsakos - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Len, and thanks for joining us this morning. A year ago, we reported earnings per share of 12 cents from ongoing operations for fiscal year 2001 in what we considered at that time to be a very challenging and defining year for the financial services industry. We were hopeful that 2002 would bring economic relief from the recession and with it, a gradually improving equity market. We gave guidance of 45 cents per share from ongoing operations, well over three times 2001 earnings. Our guidance was based on, among other assumptions, flat trading levels with 2001 and a reduction in the bank's mortgage banking revenue by approximately 50% over the year as a result of an anticipated rise in interest rates. 2 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Earnings Conference Call Today, looking back at 2002, we saw a little recovery in the economy. Instead of improvement in the equity markets, we saw double digit declines, the worst performance since 1987 and the third consecutive annual decline in the major stock indices. Our daily average transaction volumes, instead of being flat with 2001, were down 23% in 2002. In response to a sluggish economy, we saw the Federal Reserve reduce rates on fed funds to a 41-year low, thereby helping to extend the refinancing boom that began in 2001. It is in this sluggish and unpredictable environment that E*TRADE Group grew earnings per share by 275% from 12 cents per share from ongoing operations in 2001 to 45 cents in 2002, making us one of the few companies to deliver results consistent with our original guidance a year ago. Now, we did so by building scale and by expanding our margins to efficiency initiatives. We also grew revenue and experienced the hedging benefits of an effective diversification strategy. A better than expected market for our lending products offset a worse than modeled trading environment. This is really how our model is designed to work. We maintained our focus and we executed. At 14 cents per share from ongoing operations in the fourth quarter, this also marks our 10th consecutive quarter of ongoing profitability. On a reported basis for the fourth quarter, we generated $30 million in net income or earnings of 8 cents per share. Our proposition that the right model, our model, can generate greater value for our customers and shareowners than merely the sum of the parts has been proven in these challenging times. It is demonstrated by the fact that while we, too, have felt the effects of a long-term declining equity market, we do continue to prosper. We also believe the corollary will prove true, that as the economy recovers, the operating leverage we have created throughout our business model will create continued opportunities for revenue and earnings growth. This is evidenced by the fact that while many companies lowered costs by contracting and discontinuing services in response to financial constraints and economic uncertainty, we enhanced our value proposition for our customers by strengthening our services and expanding our product offerings. We continue to drive share value for our shareowners by improving our margins, increasing our return on capital and generating positive cash flow. Our brokerage business is profitable and we continue to build additional operating leverage. This quarter we again lowered the breakeven volume point of our retail brokerage business from 65,000 transactions per day to 63,000. With our current infrastructure, we can generate ongoing earnings of 4 cents per share a year for every additional 10,000 average transactions per day we produce above breakeven. Our focus on operating efficiencies has made us a low-cost producer in the industry. Now to exploit this leverage, we've escalated our focus to increase market share. We are very encouraged with the initial results of our new Power of Nine campaign, providing a flat 999 commission and a 9 second trade guarantee for active traders who make at least nine stock trades per month. Since its implementation in the fall, E*TRADE Securities online trading market share has increased with our daily transaction volume averaging 88,000 for the quarter, excluding professional trading, an 11% increase from our third quarter. This 11% improvement in transaction volumes during the quarter reflected a sharp increase in our market share and really the success of that value proposition. During the fourth quarter, we grew accounts in most active trader segments. Those customers who make 300 or more trades per quarter, by 19%. And our accounts in our overall active trader segment by 14%. We also saw our average assets per household increase by 4% to $14,000. A positive directional change from prior quarter declines. While we focus this year on growing our active trader segment, we also continue to expand and improve service across all retail segments. We recently introduced new cash management functionality which provides our customers with the ability to transfer cash real-time electronically. As a result, customers can transfer cash into and between their E*TRADE Securities brokerage and E*TRADE bank accounts, providing instant adjustment to balances and immediate buying power. Additionally, customers can consolidate their assets at E*TRADE Securities from other brokerage firms by electronically transferring their accounts, eliminating paperwork and delays. Each of these enhancements improves the customer experience, reduces service cost and drives incremental revenue and asset gathering. In our institutional business, we continue to build scale, completing the acquisition of Engleman Securities, a floor brokerage business and institutional direct access business on the Chicago stock exchange for approximately $7 million in stock and cash. Formed in 1967, Engleman executes principal and agency transactions with other broker dealers, clearing members of the NSCC and institutional customers in its capacity as a registered broker dealer. Through this acquisition, E*TRADE Securities reinforces its position as a leader and a broker-to-broker and institutional 3 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Earnings Conference Call trading sector and adds 16 experienced traders to our current talent pool. Assisting in the further development of our institutional brokerage business. The acquisition is accretive and cash flow positive. Also in keeping with our commitment to have our international retail brokerage operations at breakeven or better in 2003, we've decided to streamline our approach to Germany. We will exiting our German infrastructure as currently constituted and have taken a $12 million related charge this quarter. We continue to support our German customers consistent our global focus on active traders. With this and other initiatives either completed or in process, adding to our existing profitable international businesses like Canada, that has been profitable now for five consecutive quarters, we exit the year positioned at international retail brokerage operations at breakeven or better in 2003. This really positions us for future growth in revenue and income as the international marketplace improves. At the bank, now the seventh largest OTS regulated thrift as measured by assets, we completed the acquisition of Ganis Credit Corp. for cash on December 23, expanding our diversified portfolio of consumer assets by adding $1.8 billion in recreational vehicle, marine and motor sport loans. The credit profile of borrowers represented by these assets is strong. With an average FICO score of 719 and historical and annualized loss ratios on Ganis' RV and marine loans equaling 45 and 65 basis points respectively. Now this acquisition contributes 20 basis points to the bank's future net interest spread, strengthens operations and increases profitability. The addition of the Ganis origination and servicing platforms and its experienced management team enables to us solidify our position in the consumer lending market. We also expect to create at least $3 million in annual savings by transitioning our existing auto portfolio to Ganis' well-established and profitable servicing business. The purchase of Ganis for a premium of $45 million is also accretive to earnings and is cash flow positive. By effectively leveraging our expanding line of products, we continue to see success in our cross sale and upsell activities. 25% of our mortgage products and 45% of our home equity products sold during the quarter came from cross sell. Similar to the levels we saw in the third quarter. Our focus on lowering our funding costs, while continually improving the value proposition we offer our bank customers, has generated growth in transaction deposits both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Transaction deposits now account for 51% of total retail deposit balances of 49% in the third quarter and 35% in the fourth quarter last year. In our mortgage business, we continue to take advantage of opportunities arising from the low interest rate environment, generating a record $2.2 billion in direct originations for the quarter. This brings our total origination volume for the year to $6.2 billion, a 19% annual increase. Similarly, through our correspondent relationships, we originated over $1.4 billion in mortgage home loans for the quarter and $5.8 billion for the year. While we anticipate a decline in direct and indirect origination volumes, when interest rates rise and refinancing demands wanes, we have expanded our correspondent relationships by 41% over the past 12 months. We expect these correspondence to provide additional sources of ongoing purchase money and refinancing mortgage revenue. We also expect to offset declines in mortgage revenue to growth in our lending products such as home equity loans and lines of credit that see greater demand and usage as interest rates rise. We also carried $1.1 billion of originated mortgage whole loan product locked in the pipeline in the first quarter of 2003. Now, our model strength and scalability is rooted in our powerful technology. Having invested early in a highly flexible, highly scalable state of the art technology platform, we are now able to rebalance our investment into future technology developments and reinnovation. Our development of industry-leading network routing technology provides reliable, fast access to the E*TRADE financial website. In addition, this was our first full quarter utilizing Linux and open standard space technologies. Utilizing this platform, we improved keynote transaction speed by 30% to under five seconds while improving reliability to 99.4%. Besides improving performance of our core technologies, we've accomplished numerous technology initiatives this year to enhance our customer experience. Such as a completely redesigned website while reducing technology costs by $86 million year-over-year. We made significant investments in improved call management software and additional associate training to improve our level of customer service. We also consolidated our call centers, strengthened quality monitoring and improved response times. As a result, we saw significant improvement over the last 12 months in our quality measurements such as a 39% reduction in increase per transaction. In demonstration of our commitment to corporate governance and to comply with both the spirit and intent of the Sarbannes-Oxley Act, all executive officer loans have been fully satisfied. These loans are part of the shareowner approved stock option plan that granted loans to executive 4 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call officers to allow them to exercise options and hold stock. Repayment of the loans was made through a combination of cash payments and the company's redemption of that stock. We also remain active in our search for two independent outside directors to fill two open positions on our board. Including key slots on the compensation and audit committees. The independent nominating committee of the board has retained Christian [INAUDIBLE] in this effort. The search for new directors is being conducted consistent with Calpers and NYSE guidelines. Our board meets both the NYSE and the Calpers guidelines for board independence. Our board is composed of eight directors, 75% of whom are independent. We have an independent lead director who presides over the other independent directors that meet regularly without management and we made proactive changes to our board in April, 2002, two months before the NYSE published its new standards. Now to Len for the numbers. Leonard Purkis - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Christos. This quarter we generated total net revenues of $349 million up 6% from last quarter and up 1% for the same quarter last year. This brings our total net revenues to $1.3 billion for the year, a 4% increase over last year. Due to creation of greater operating leverage, we continue to improve earnings, delivering quarterly income from ongoing operations to $52 million, 21% increase quarter-over-quarter and a 111% increase year-over-year. For the year, we generated ongoing earnings of $161 million, compared to $40 million in 2001 for a 300% increase in 2002 over 2001. We were $26 million cash flow positive for the quarter, bringing our year-end free cash position to $367 million. This represents our third consecutive quarter of positive cash flow, exceeding the commitment we made a year ago to be cash flow positive for the second half of this year. At the bank, we continue to expand our consumer loan portfolio and our home equity products, improving return on equity while remaining focused on credit quality. As a result our net charge-offs for the quarter were 14 basis points of total average assets up two basis points from last quarter but well below the OTS third quarter industry average of 24 basis points. Credit quality of our active portfolio remains strong as demonstrated by the weighted average FICO scores for our mortgage and consumer portfolios, holding solid at 724 and 727 respectively. Our brokerage revenue for the quarter totaled $218 million, a 4% increase from our third quarter and a 5% decrease from same quarter last year. The sequential increase in brokerage revenue reflected our gains in market share during the quarter. For the calender year we produced $867 million in net brokerage revenue, a 5% decline from calendar year 2001. This decline was due almost exclusively to reduced retail trading activity and lower interest income from lower market balances, partially offset by the addition of professional trading and increased principal transaction revenue. Our banking revenue for the fourth quarter grew to $131 billion, a 9% increase from third quarter and a 13% increase over last year's same quarter. Annually, net banking revenue totaled $459 million, a 26% increase over 2001. This improvement both on a quarterly and an annual basis is attributable to increases in both interest and non-interest income. The declining interest rate environment hindered our ability to widen spreads because of high prepayments experienced throughout the industry, but enabled us to drive record revenues and income in our mortgage banking activity. As a result, we saw a decline in net interest revenue over the quarter by $2 million or 4%. But saw an increase in mortgage banking revenue by $10 million. For the year, mortgage banking revenue totaled $212 million, a $41 million increase over 2001. And in net interest income, we generated $215 million in 2002, a $54 million increase over 2001. While we do not anticipate this level of mortgage revenue generation to be sustainable when interest rates rise and refinancing volumes slow, we expect to offset declining mortgage revenue with higher interest income, both from higher spreads and a larger overall balance sheet as we enter 2003. Our net interest spread totaled 140 basis points, a 12-basis point decline from our third quarter spread. Escalated prepayments, the limited availability of asset portfolios for purchase that met our credit requirements during the year and the closing of Ganis late in the quarter combined to cause us to miss our target in the quarter of 200 basis points [INAUDIBLE] net interest spread. But maintaining our credit quality standards was more important to us than an internal spread count. Nonetheless, we remain optimistic in achieving our goal in 2003 with the addition of prime credit quality, high yielding assets like those from Ganis. With the acquisition of the Ganis assets and its 20 basis point positive impact on our spread, we closed the quarter with a pro forma spread of 160 basis points. As you will find detailed in our expanded bank metric table, provision for loan losses totaled $3 million, a 35% decline quarter-over-quarter and 38% decline year-over-year, reflecting the strong credit characteristics of our mortgage and consumer portfolios. Our reserve now total is $27 5 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call million, an increase from $16 million last quarter with the addition of reserves acquired with Ganis and continues to represent the equivalent of 12 months forward expected losses in both our mortgage and consumer loan portfolios. With these recent changes, our reserves as a percentage of total nonperforming assets now equal 104%, a 29 percentage point increase from 75% at the end of the third quarter and an 8 percentage point increase from 96% at the end of fourth quarter last year. Turning to the expense side, cost of services equaled $147 million for the quarter, a 1% increase over third quarter and a 9% decrease over last year same quarter. The $2 million increase over the third quarter was largely related to incremental costs associated with our mortgage business. However, more importantly for the year, cost of services totalled $567 million, down $28 million or 5% year-over-year including the addition of professional trading and the first full year of [DEMPSEY] and the additional incremental costs associated with the sustained mortgage origination fund. This gives us a gross margin of $202 million or 58% as a percent of revenue for the fourth quarter and $759 million or 57% as a percent of revenue for the year. On a quarterly basis, this represents a 2 percentage point improvement over last quarter, a 5 percentage point improvement over same quarter last year and on an annual basis, a 4 percentage point improvement over 2001. The benefits of our efficiency initiatives can also be seen in our operating costs. Operating expenses totaled $112 million for the quarter, up 6% from third quarter and down 17% from same quarter last year. The increase in operating expense over third quarter is largely driven by a $6 million increase in selling and marketing expenses. As we increased our visibility in the marketplace, we continued our Power of 9 promotion. Annually, ongoing operating expenses totaled $470 million, $109 million less than ongoing operating expenses in 2001. Reductions were made in all three categories of ongoing expense, being selling and marketing, technology development and general administrative. As a result, our ongoing operating margin increased to $90 million or 26% as a percent of revenue in the fourth quarter, up $12 million from our third quarter and up $42 million from the same quarter last year. Annually, our ongoing operating margin totaled $289 million or 22% of revenue, up $187 million from 2001. On an ongoing basis, we produced earnings of $52 million or 14 cents per share for the fourth quarter, 21% increase in dollars from the third quarter and 111% increase in dollars over the same quarter last year. On a reported basis, the company's fourth quarter net income grew to $30 million or earnings of 8 cents per share. This represents a 47% increase from last quarter and a 41% increase from last year's same quarter. Turning to our guidance for 2003, we anticipate current tensions in the world will continue, causing an uncertain global marketplace and a challenging operating environment absent of any real global growth stimulative in the near term. Specifically we put our 2003 business traffic era with the following assumptions. The U.S. economic recovery and financial markets will remain sluggish. Interest rates will not increase significantly with little flexibility remaining for additional cuts. Investors will remain skeptical of performance of equities with doubts lingering around corporate governors and the global economy will be in a similar or weaker state with European and Asian economies uneven. As a result of these anticipating conditions, our guidance for 2003 is a range of 45 cents to 55 cents earnings per share from ongoing operations. We have provided a table in the earnings release outlining our range of assumptions. Our assumptions are based around five key drivers of our business model, specifically transaction volumes, excluding professional trading, mortgage revenues, consisting of both our retail and corresponding businesses, bank net interest spread, marketing expense and operating efficiencies. At the lower end of our guidance at 45 cents, we have assumed average daily transactions to be flat with 2002 between 85,000 to 90,000. The decline in mortgage revenue of approximately 60% over the year. Average bank net interest spreads between 160 to 170 basis points. Marketing spread flat with 2002 and no material improvement in operating efficiencies. At the mid-range of our guidance at 50 cents, we've assumed average daily transactions to be up slightly from 2002 between 90,000 and 95,000 with gains in market share. The decline in mortgage revenue of approximately 55% over the year, average bank net interest spreads of between 170 to 180 basis points, an increase in marketing spend by 15 to 20% over 2002 levels to drive gains in market share and additional operating efficiencies were around $15 million. At the high end of our range of our guidance at 55 cents, we've assumed average daily transactions up 10% from 2002 between 95,000 and 100,000 with gains in market share. With decline in mortgage revenue of approximately 50% over the year. Average bank net interest spreads between 180 to 190 basis points. An increase in marketing spend by 20 to 25% over 2002 levels to drive gains in market share and additional operating 6 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Earnings Conference Call efficiencies of around $30 million. Actual performance is a mix of these key drivers and could vary from these assumptions. So, within these ranges we anticipate being cash flow positive for the year. We also expect our first quarter will be the softest quarter with earnings per share below fourth quarter levels by approximately 20 to 30% as we increase our disciplined and targeted marketing investment that has provided such positive returns and the mortgage business flows from the record pace of the fourth quarter. We expect earnings per share to improve for the rest of the year. While [INAUDIBLE] guidance that could include a fourth straight year of decline in the financial markets, a quicker than expected drop-off in mortgage lending and a credit environment that inhibits our ability to widen spreads outpacing the development of additional operating efficiencies. We also know that we have the business model that can produce strong returns should the environment turn more positive. It is this strength of flexibility in our business model that gives us the confidence that we can produce positive returns in the most challenging of times and that the operating leverage in our model has the capability to be highly profitable when the environment improves. So, closing, in a highly challenging market environment, on an ongoing basis we produced the most profitable year in the history of this company. We not only generated three quarters of positive cash flow, we repurchased and retired another 15 million shares in 2002 for a total of 53 million shares since August of 2001. We've also continued to deleverage our balance sheet by retiring an additional $65 million in convertible debt this year for a total of $280 million retired since June 2001. Even more importantly, through strategic and tactical acquisitions, [INAUDIBLE] and execution of efficiency initiatives, we've been able to build significant operating leverage within and between business segments to produce profit in challenging times and position to us be even more profitable when market conditions improve. With that, back to you, Chris. Christos Cotsakos - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Len. In December, we announced the results of our quarterly customer index tracking investor sentiment about the economy, the market and their personal finances. During the quarter, we found that investor outlook on the U.S. stock market remains unchanged for the third quarter of 2002 survey with a 73% majority remaining confident that the market will improve within the next 6 to 24 months. Further, 84% of respondents thinks it's likely that the U.S. will go to war with Iraq. And 54% believe a war will have a negative impact on the U.S. economy. Notably 40% of respondents did not feel a war would have any impact on investment behavior. With regard to financial outlook in investing strategies, our studies show that approximately 60% of respondents indicated that they would continue to stay the course and hold their equity investment, similar to 64% in the third quarter. While 8% said they would sell out and move to cash, comparable to 11% last quarter. Active traders are significantly more optimistic about the general economy and the stock market recovery than other customer segments. And more than half of customers, 57%, still find real estate investments more attractive than stocks, similar to 58% in the third quarter. This information paints a challenging picture in 2003. The financial markets remain volatile while investor near term confidence is flat, marked by geopolitical, economic and market uncertainty. In response, we're focused entirely on the following eight key initiatives in 2003 to maximize results and to drive growth through E*TRADE financial. First is to further refine our value proposition around product offerings and pricing for both bank and brokerage. Continue to improve it in customer experience at all call centers through training and ongoing performance evaluation. Ongoing growth in brokerage market share with a focus on the most profitable active trader segment. Further optimization of our touch point strategy centered on relationship management. Continued diversification of the bank's asset portfolio, driving wider spreads without sacrificing credit quality. Additional integration and synergy optimization of acquired entities. Delivery of additional operating leverage in our institutional and market making businesses and operating efficiencies across all areas of business. And number eight, strategic investment in marketing around product offerings in our brand. So what does this potentially mean for E*TRADE Group shareowners? Stable to improving revenue and profitability, driven by increased operating leverage in brokerage and banking, improved customer service and an expanded share of our customer's wallet. Not only have we delivered what we promised during the challenging times, we're better poised than ever to take advantage of most opportunities to grow both top and bottom lines as prudent prospects become available. We will maintain our focus, through the proven financial model we have built, we believe you, our shareholders, not only get superior operating leverage, you will reap the benefits of the business model that provides downside protection in challenging times and greater upside potential in better times. With that, we now open the call to your questions. 7 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Operator Thank you, the floor is now open for questions. If you have a question, please press the number 1 followed by 4 on your touch-tone phone. If at any point your question is answered, you may remove yourself from the queue by pressing the pound key. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We ask that while you pose your question, that you pick up your handset to provide optimum sound quality. Thank you, our first question is coming from Rich Repetto of Putnam Lovell Securities. Rich Repetto - Putnam Lovell Securities Yeah, hi, guys. If we're going to limit it to one question, my question has to do with the guidance going forward. As an example, even if you look at the first quarter, you know, if we brought on Ganis, if the mortgage pipeline is flat with the prior quarter, the refi index is looking pretty robust, why are numbers down 20 to 30% just in the first quarter? And to me it points to marketing spend. Is there any, you know, why in all these scenarios did we, in your up scenario are we looking at a 20% increase in market spend in the coming year? Leonard Purkis - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - Chief Financial Officer Well, we're looking at the marketing of investments starting in the first quarter, Rich. And that's, you know, the predominant driver of why we're saying, you know, that the first quarter will be our softest quarter. That's going to be the kickoff to driving that marketing expense. In the upside case, the increased overall investment we're going to be putting into marketing shows that we have a market that's receptive to an even more increased marketing investment. Christos Cotsakos - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer The big key is, Rich, we've been so successful in the Power of 9 marketing campaign, where we've gained share dramatically over the last quarter, we believe that some of the value propositions we now have with enhanced customer experience, some of the improvements we've made in technology, that now is the time for us to continue to invest in that arena and make the awareness more widespread with regard to our product pricing and service offering. Rich Repetto - Putnam Lovell Securities Okay, and as a follow-up to the question, the guidance. The Power of 9 program, you know, it seemed -- I think you spent around -- was it $45 million or so marketing this quarter? I guess the question is what's the revenue assumption in the first quarter given that you have Ganis, you know, mortgages are still fairly robust, trading, you know, one could assume flat. So, what's the revenue sort of outlook quarter-to-quarter in your first quarter assumption? Leonard Purkis - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - Chief Financial Officer Rich, at this stage we're only giving EPS guidance. I think that's reasonable in terms of what we've given out in terms of the detail in the earnings release on the key assumptions. There's enough there with our investment in marketing and our assumptions on what the mortgage is -- mortgage book is going to do in the first quarter to make some reasonable assumptions on the revenue for the year. And for the quarter. 8 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Rich Repetto - Putnam Lovell Securities Okay. Thanks, guys. Mitch Caplan - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - Vice President, Chief Operating Officer Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mike Vinciquerra of Raymond James. Mike Vinciquerra - Raymond James Thanks, good morning. Had a question on the -- kind of the professional trader commissions. I'm trying to figure out what the breakdown if you could, Len, between your retail commissions and professional commissions are, because there was an increase in the quarter from I guess .003 cents per share to .004. Can you give us a little bit of detail on that, please? Leonard Purkis - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - Chief Financial Officer Yeah, the professional trading per share commission went up just purely based on volume and how we really looked at the profitability of customers we have in that business and the profitability of customers is up and you see that being reflected in the shares. Mike Vinciquerra - Raymond James Can you add maybe a decimal place just so we can get a feel for the magnitude of the change in that commission portrayed quarter-over-quarter? Leonard Purkis - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - Chief Financial Officer We can get you that. Mike Vinciquerra - Raymond James Okay. And the breakdown in commissions between the professional and retail, do you have that available by chance? Leonard Purkis - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - Chief Financial Officer No, we don't break that out in terms of -- what you're seeing when you get the earnings release is the commission per transaction is on retail brokerage only. Mike Vinciquerra - Raymond James Right. 9 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Leonard Purkis - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - Chief Financial Officer And then you will see, below that, the commission per share, which is just professional trading. And the reason we've done that is we don't want to mix apples and oranges. You have two very different revenue producers there on different bases, so we've kept them separate. Mike Vinciquerra - Raymond James I understand completely. It makes a lot of sense, it's just with such a small number on the professional trading, it's tough to determine what the magnitude of the changes. If you could get us the number -- Leonard Purkis - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - Chief Financial Officer We can add a couple more decimal points -- Mitch Caplan - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - Vice President, Chief Operating Officer And Mike, at a high level, I would tell you it was pretty flat quarter-over-quarter. What you saw was an increase in commission per share traded and a decrease in the number of shares that were traded in the quarter so that basically all in all it was flat to Q3. Operator Thank you, our next question comes from Glen Shore of Deutsche Bank Alex Brown. Glen Shore - Deutsche Bank Alex Brown Hi, thanks, guys. I guess limiting the question. one of the five key drivers on the assumptions for next year's operating efficiencies, and you have a range for no material improvements to plus 30 -- or minus 30 in this case. Can you give us a little color from where might it come from? Or where your gut is, and how much cost is there to take out? And maybe you could weave into, I'll squeeze two questions into one, weave into the facility of restructuring in Germany, how much costs does that free up and are there others out there? Mitch Caplan - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - Vice President, Chief Operating Officer Hi, Glen, it's Mitch. Glen Shore - Deutsche Bank Alex Brown Hi, Mitch. Mitch Caplan - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - Vice President, Chief Operating Officer Let me start -- if you look at traditionally the areas that we have evaluated, it's been in the cost conservative area, it's been in G&A, it's been in tech, it's been in marketing. I think based on Len's answer to his last question we see an opportunity for a prudent marketing investment in 2003. As we look forward, I think the big difference is rather than seeing that marketing investment spent the way we necessarily have in the past on brand, it will be significantly more product-focused around the attributes of particular products in the value proposition. So, accordingly where we will look to save the most significant costs will be in cost of services as a result of additional technology infrastructure initiatives as well as in 10 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Earnings Conference Call the general G&A area. And I think you can assume, as you have seen us do the in past, that we will continue to prudently review our operating costs and trim excess out where it is available. I think if you look at the range of guidance, we do believe that there is some opportunity there for continued cost savings through these operating efficiencies. The issue being how much of those savings will we reinvest back in the business in the form of marketing as well as tech [INAUDIBLE]. Christos Cotsakos - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer One of the big issues for us this year that Josh is working on is technology reinnovation, much like what we did with the new-improved website this year. There is a lot of opportunity through integration like with the real-time cash transfer now, to really, we believe, blow ahead of the competition in how we're integrating our products, services and suite of offerings with pricing that we think can continue to gain market share in a very substantial way over the next year. Mitch Caplan - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - Vice President, Chief Operating Officer So, the number you're seeing, Glen, when we're giving guidance is net. Meaning obviously the gross cost savings, net of the reinvestments that we think are applicable in order to continue to enhance the value proposition technologically of all the product and the marketing of those specific products. Glen Shore - Deutsche Bank Alex Brown And am I pushing it to ask the Germany question -- Mitch Caplan - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - Vice President, Chief Operating Officer No, not at all. Germany, as you know, we had committed to exit this year, breakeven for retail brokerage in Europe and in Asia. We wanted to abide by that commitment and so one of the things that we simply did was say, as we have always talked about that, with respect to Europe we wanted to have one global technology platform and to the greatest degree possible, we wanted to operate out of one location in Europe and passport into the other countries. So, exiting Germany is not exiting with respect to customer relationships, it's really infrastructure. That $12 million charge is built into the numbers in allowing us to be able to pro forma be it breakeven for both Europe and Asia as well going forward in our retail brokerage operation. Glen Shore - Deutsche Bank Alex Brown So, bottom line is right now you feel that Europe is running at breakeven -- Mitch Caplan - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - Vice President, Chief Operating Officer Post these--- That's correct. Glen Shore - Deutsche Bank Alex Brown Okay. Super. Thanks, guys. 11 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Mitch Caplan - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - Vice President, Chief Operating Officer Absolutely. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from Colin Clark of Smith Barney. Colin Clark - Smith Barney Hi. Good morning. I was hoping you could comment a couple of the trends in the brokerage areas, specifically the average daily trades was up sequentially while the shares traded in the professional trading segment was down. I was hoping you could comment on that trend and additionally what drove the average commission per trade down? Thanks. R. Jarrett Lilien - E*TRADE Securities, Inc. - CBO, President Sure, Jarrett can handle that. You have three questions in there, I think. Colin Clark - Smith Barney Sorry about that. R. Jarrett Lilien - E*TRADE Securities, Inc. - CBO, President You have to break them up into three. On the professional side, I think what was being touched on before, you know, that's a totally different animal, what drives the trading behavior there. And what you saw in the quarter was obviously, you know, holidays, you saw a period of volatility decreasing and, you know, you have a smaller number of people doing a larger amount of trades in that part of the business. Volatility, when there's a lot of it, will drive them to the market and their volumes will be up more than the market. When volatility is down, that will have the magnifying effect the other way. And also when you go around holiday times and people take time off, you know, that tends to impact the numbers. You also throw on there the entrance of Super Montage and people like to sit back and see how these new systems impact the market. So, really that's what's going on in the professional segment, just a lot of, you know, stuff coming together, lower volatility, holidays and a new system in the marketplace. So, you know, we're already seeing some of that bounce back here in January as people come back to the market. On the broader side, the 88,000 trades per day in the quarter, we're seeing a good pickup as we noted in market share and the Power of 9 has been extremely successful and actually we've had now market share gains in the more active segment for the last two quarters but they're growing momentum of that pickup here in the fourth quarter. And that gets you to the average commission per trade was down about I believe 49 cents. There were two things that contributed to that, actually it's down 47 cents and there were two things contributed to that. One was a change of mix with the type of trades people were doing, specifically you saw a decrease in the amount of options business which carries a higher commission on it and out of the 47 cents that was responsible for about 12 cents of that. And then the rest was the success of Power of 9 and more market share pickup on the active trading side which has got a lower commission and that was responsible for the other 35 cents. Colin Clark - Smith Barney Great. Thank you. 12 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Mitch Caplan - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - Vice President, Chief Operating Officer Also, if you step back quickly and if you remember on the earnings call last quarter, one of the things we talked to you about in the professional trader segment was that we did in fact, have certain unprofitable trading arrangements and that we were going to eliminate those. As a result, what you did see was a decline in shares traded because of that, but an increase in the commission. So, again, it's the focus on making sure that every transaction in all the segments are profitable. Colin Clark - Smith Barney Okay. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from Justin Hughes of Jeffries and Company. Justin Hughes - Jeffries and Company Good morning. I wanted to ask a question on the bank side. I was wondering, you touched on it briefly in the comments, but I wonder if you had more detail on why the loss provision went down when your dollar amount of nonaccruals went up and your dollar amount of charge-offs went up? Christos Cotsakos - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Well, when you look at the provision itself, the reason why the provision went down is because we -- we look at our overall reserves at the end of the quarter relative to our expected losses. Then as you know, we reserve 20 basis points for mortgages held for investment and a minimum of 12 months on consumer assets. But in connection with the Ganis acquisition, we acquired a reserve from Ganis also. So at the end of the quarter, you look back and you see what is the total reserve that you have on your books, after your charge-offs for the quarter, to determine whether your ending reserves are adequate and prudent. And it worked out for us that we had to provision less because of that. Justin Hughes - Jeffries and Company Okay. So basically part of the acquired reserve is -- was covering the existing portfolio. Christos Cotsakos - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer That's right. Justin Hughes - Jeffries and Company Okay. I'll get back in queue. Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from Rich Repetto of Putnam Lovell Securities. 13 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Rich Repetto - Putnam Lovell Securities Yeah, guys, I just wanted to -- I'm not sure whether I missed this in your initial talk, but on the buyback, any update on the buyback, and, you know, what's the outlook there in the quarter? Leonard Purkis - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - Chief Financial Officer You're talking about the stock buyback? Rich Repetto - Putnam Lovell Securities Yes. Leonard Purkis - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - Chief Financial Officer Yes, we have 4 million shares still available under the board-approved plan which was 50 million shares. Christos Cotsakos - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Yes. Leonard Purkis - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - Chief Financial Officer And that's where we are right now. Rich Repetto - Putnam Lovell Securities Okay. And then as far as any other VC transactions, I know there was some selling this past quarter. Could you comment on that? What was the rationale or what you knew about it and any more of that expected this quarter? Christos Cotsakos - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Sure, one of our very long-term early stage investors, General Atlantic, which has been in the stock almost seven years now, or close to eight, you know, reduced all of their exposure this last quarter. The two big overhangs that we did have in the marketplace from those two initial investors were General Atlantic at 6.5 million shares and [SOFT BANK] with all of their shares. Both of those now are down to zero. So with the exception of that, it's just the normal ebb and flow of what institutions look at in their holding positions. Rich Repetto - Putnam Lovell Securities Okay. Thank you. Operator Thank you. As a reminder, if you do have a question, please press 1 followed by 4 on your touch-tone phone. Our next question is a follow-up from Mike Vinciquerra of Raymond James. 14 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Mike Vinciquerra - Raymond James Thanks, justice a question on the commission rate, a follow-up. Can you provide any sort of guidance on where we would expect the global transaction commission to go, I mean it's at about $12 now. Is that expected to continue to fall over the course of '03? And can you give us an idea of where might it go to? Mitch Caplan - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - Vice President, Chief Operating Officer Yeah, I mean I think at this point, you know, it depends, obviously, on a lot of variables, but we're estimating for that to be pretty flat. Mike Vinciquerra - Raymond James Thank you. Mitch Caplan - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - Vice President, Chief Operating Officer I think the big issue, as you know, it's just a pure rate volume analysis. So for us as we model it out, I think flat is a rational assumption. If, however, you saw it decline, net top line revenues would grow more as would bottom line profitability just based on the volume pickup. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from Glen Shore of Deutsche Bank Alex Brown. Glen Shore - Deutsche Bank Alex Brown Just a quick question on the balance sheet. Two mental items. One is mandatory redeemable preferred securities went up around $50 million in the quarter. I was curious where that came from? And then if someone could explain what accumulated other comprehensive losses and why it's creeping up a little bit each quarter? Leonard Purkis - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - Chief Financial Officer Okay, the redeemable preferences are full trust preferreds which are at the bank level and we see this as a low-cost way of raising tier 1 capital for the bank and that we went out and did two traunches this quarter for the increase there. And that just gets -- I think we raised $50 million and funded down to the bank $40 million of that. So, that's just a nice way of having low cost tier 1 capital for the bank. In terms of OCI, the biggest drivers in OCI are the effects of the swaps and that just moves as the market moves as the balance sheet moves and it's a point in time situation and gets fully disclosed when we do the Qs. Glen Shore - Deutsche Bank Alex Brown So there's nothing inside the OCI that should lead to a writedown effort because the swaps hang out there in ebb and flow. Leonard Purkis - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - Chief Financial Officer No, we put the disclosure in the Qs and Ks. It will eventually get through the income statement but on the other hand it will [INAUDIBLE] the gains that offset that. 15 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Earnings Conference Call Glen Shore - Deutsche Bank Alex Brown Understood. On the bank side, so, the balance sheet is bigger now, could you make us not wait for the call report and hit us with the equity at the bank right now? Leonard Purkis - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - Chief Financial Officer Yeah, the average equity at the bank for calculation is about $795 million. Glen Shore - Deutsche Bank Alex Brown Great, thanks very much. Leonard Purkis - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - Chief Financial Officer I beg your pardon, on a GAAP basis, it's going to be $805 million. Christos Cotsakos - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Okay, with that, Glen, we will take one more question. Operator Thank you. Our last question will be coming from Gregory McCosco of Lord Abbott and Company. Gregory McCosco - Lord Abbott Yes, thank you. Could you talk a little bit about the breakeven? I believe you said that on a 10,000 share per day basis it would change, do you just mean 4 cents? Christos Cotsakos - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer That's correct. Above our model we will get 4 cents a share. Our goal is, we're down to 63,000 trades a day for breakeven today. Our goal is to get down to under 50. That's just the operating efficiencies that have been built in by our brokerage team. Gregory McCosco - Lord Abbott And that's significantly different than what you -- I think you said it was something much less in terms of the -- previously in the last quarter or the last few quarters? Leonard Purkis - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - Chief Financial Officer Well, the breakeven point last quarter was 65,000 and before that, up in the 70s. And a year ago, we were over 100,000. So, we've taken a tremendous amount of cost out of the brokerage business to get to that level. 16 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Christos Cotsakos - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer I think what you may be thinking of, we were looking at taking it down to 50,000 trades a day for breakeven and now looking at getting it down to 45,000. Gregory McCosco - Lord Abbott Okay. Good. And then, with regard -- I think you said something with regard to the $1.1 billion pipeline, was that with mortgages? Could you explain that again? Christos Cotsakos - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Yes, that's the locked pipeline at the end of Q4 coming in, meaning people already paid locked fees for those mortgages. Gregory McCosco - Lord Abbott And what was that at the end of Q3? Christos Cotsakos - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer It was also about 1.1. It's pretty consistent. Gregory McCosco - Lord Abbott Okay. Thank you. Christos Cotsakos - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Okay, thank you, everybody, have a good day.

FEBRUARY 03, 2003 / 7:00PM, - Q4 2002 Tele Nordeste Celular Earnings Conference Call First, primarily going to page 1, allow me to remember as I mentioned all over the year, some strategic issues that we planned and pointed out for 2002. The company's strategy in the year can be summarized as follows. The maintenance of its most valuable customers; new customer acquisition directed to high value segments; development of new services; re-enforcement of better control and CAPEX and OPEX optimization. During 2002 the company consolidated its strong image, also launching new services;See page 2. Such as Call Group, that allows customers to select phone numbers and have facilitated service features; such as Minutes Balance, that allows customers to send text messages to obtain a real-time account balance in minutes and money. Formula TIM Plan that is the equivalent to matching plan-rates to client's needs. Corporate E-Message, allows the exchange of messages free of charge among groups of customers. Zero Rate, allows zero free calls among corporate clients of the same company. Tim Shop, that was the first sale website in the region. And a special corporate application, such as location-based services; such as sales performance information retainers; such as [indecipherable]telemetry and so on. And finally, the expansion of the digital recharging network for prepaid services. Going into 2002 results;I would like to review the company's PPI sales. On page 4, it is shown the composition of the customer base. The 9.6% of 2002 growth was [indecipherable] as I said towards good customers. The total customer base of 1,099,126 customers in December 2002, having composed by 36% of post-paid pay customers and 64% of prepay customers. On the next page, page 5. It shows the [indecipherable] of 2002. The reduction of [indecipherable] 2002 compared to the one of 2001 was due fundamentally to the incoming traffic. This has had the effect of incoming traffic, the outgoing traffic grew up around 9%, while incoming dropped about 20%. On the following page, page 6, you can see the fourth quarter trends of 2002. This remains stable due to the very good customer base Tele Nordeste has. Passing now to page 7;This shows the churn trend. Tele Nordeste had an increase of the churn in 2002 compared with the one of 2001. It was caused by the customer base training that Tele Nordeste made at the end of 2002 and partially by the entrance in the market of one more competitor at the end of June 2002. Nevertheless this should increase [indecipherable] to a very low value customer that didn't effect Tele Nordeste's performance. Let's move to page 8. Page 8 shows the ARPU. The fourth quarter net ARPU in 2002 was higher than the one of the same period of 2001. You can see it was R$42.1 rise against R$41.2 rise. Also, the trend in 2002 shows the increase of the ARPU. Again, I want to point out that this effect is due to the varied and consistent customer base of Tele Nordeste. On page 9; Let's have a look at SAC. The relationship between the Subscriber acquisition cost of 2002. It was a rise of RS$110. And the gross addition compared with the one of 2001 shows the company has been successful on attracting new customers with lower SAC. I want to underline that it was without any handset subsidies. Moving on to the next page, page 10;I would like additionally to point out the continuous improvement of the Short Message Service. Which grew in the fourth quarter of 2002, by 276% over the fourth quarter of 2001. A total of 86.5 million messages were sent during the last quarter of 2002. This volume year-over-year is an increase of about 470%. Passing from 51m to 270m. We pass now to the financial items. On page 11, we can see the growth of the net revenue of 2002 over 2001. Firstly on the left side, look at the increase of the fourth quarter 2002 compared with the fourth quarter of 2001, that was about 13.5%. R$251m, against R$221m of the previous year. On the right side, look at the performance on an annual base, the increase of the net revenue was 11.5%. R$921m against R$826m of 2001. In terms of net service revenue only, the growth was about 8.5%. 3 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

FEBRUARY 03, 2003 / 7:00PM, - Q4 2002 Tele Nordeste Celular Earnings Conference Call Moving to the next page, page 12;Let us see the EBITDA of the four months. On the left side, it is shown the performance of the fourth quarter 2002 against 2001 in [indecipherable] or Reais, while in the right side this is in percentage. Always comparing the last quarter 2002 and 2001 and the year 2002 to 2001. In the fourth quarter 2002, Tele Nordeste reported a consolidated EBITDA of R$121.8m, representing 48.5% of a margin against R$92.6m for the fourth quarter of 2001, where we had a 41.8% margin. Year-over-year the result was of R$427.7m against R$377.7m. This represents and increase year-over-year of about 26.7%. In terms of EBITDA margins, it was 46.4% against 40.9% from 2002. I would like to just say that this is a 5.5% performance. On the next page, page 13;Let us have a comparison on the net revenue service only. Considering the effect only the net service revenue, as you can see the EBITDA margin is even better. In the fourth quarter, we achieved a margin of 51.1% compared with the one of 43.2% of 2001. Year-over-year the result was 49.1% against almost 42% 2001. On the next page, that is page 14;Let us have a look at the CAPEX figures. The CAPEX in 2002 was about R$74m, R$75m against R$132m of 2001. This amount of investment has been mainly directed to the optimization of the company's processes to the CRM and new product development. Strengthening more and more Tele Nordeste's relationship with its customers. And the end, moving to the last page, that's page 15;This is the bottom line result. The net profit increased from R$28.2m in the fourth quarter of 2001 to R$46m for the fourth quarter 2002. Year-over-year the net profit passed from R$65.5m of 2001 to R$118.6m of 2002 with an increase of 81.1%. This, we consider this quite interesting. Well, I have finished ladies and gentlemen.

Our first question comes from Daniel Henriques with Goldman Sachs. Daniel Henriques - Goldman Sachs - Analyst Hi. I have two questions. First, on CAPEX, if you could give us some CAPEX guidance for GSM over the next couple of years? And how many GSM subscribers you expect to have, if you have some projections of how many GSM subscribers you are going to have by the end of this year and maybe by the end of next year. If you could give us some guidance in terms of subscriber growth for 2003? Thank you. 4 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

FEBRUARY 03, 2003 / 7:00PM, - Q4 2002 Tele Nordeste Celular Earnings Conference Call Sergio Bartoletti - Tele Nordeste Celular - CEO Well. The CAPEX, I mean we have already a very, very clear idea about the CAPEX for 2003 and 2004. Fundamentally what I want to underline is the strategy that the company pointed out. And the strategy is to have all over Brazil GSM coverage. Of course you know very well that in Brazil we have a team, a group. We will be the first operator having the national GSM coverage. So I think it's very important also for Tele Nordeste where already we have about 2 million customers that need to move to this new technology, to have a Brazil coverage. That is very important for us. In terms of investment, I would like to point out another issue that the company performance, of the company in the [indecipherable] is very, very good. So we don't need a tool and extend [indecipherable] to make our investment on GSM networks. That is the other issue that is important to keep in mind and to better understand the details of Tele Nordeste. Going to another question that you made regarding the number of customers that we pointed out that we plan to have by the end of this year and the end of next year. This is a forecast, so we think that almost 20%, 25% will be the total base, the global base by the end of 2003 in terms of GSM. And we think that by the end of 2004, this figure will be around 55%, 60%. Of course it is a plan and of course we have to compare with the answers that the markets will give. But we assume this figure because you know also here in Brazil every two years, for the customer, the most important thing that they want to do is to change the handset. Of course we are not basing these figures only on the handset side. We are basing the figures regarding strategies that we will follow, giving the customer some additional features, like for example the one that will maintain its number. So fundamentally that's my answer. I don't know if you have any other details? Daniel Henriques - Goldman Sachs - Analyst Just one follow-up question. 60%, let's say 55% to 60% by the end of 2004 seems kind of aggressive. I know this is a plan, in your plan are you considering subsidies to stimulate people to migrate so fast to GSM? If you do that, I mean assuming that you reach your plan to get 60% of GSM clients by the end of 2004, what kind of EBITDA margins do you think we will be talking about in 2003 and 2004 to pay for the migration? That's the final question thank you. Sergio Bartoletti - Tele Nordeste Celular - CEO Okay. Well I mean as I said this figure to be quite aggressive, or seems to be quite aggressive. But fundamentally we think that we can achieve this migration of customers. In terms of stimulating customers, well I mean I can assure everybody that it's not in our strategy to subsidize the migration. Because we don't think that we have to subsidize migration and considering also this reason, I mean our targets for 2003 is to maintain the same level of performance of Tele Nordeste, as it was this year. Daniel Henriques - Goldman Sachs - Analyst Okay. Thank you. 5 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call As you saw this morning, we reported GAAP earnings of 21 cents per share, 23 cents if you exclude charges associated with store real estate, exceeding expectations. Our fourth quarter sales grew two percent to 2.82b. Our operating profit in the fourth quarter grew 32 percent, and EPS grew 54 percent. For the full year sales rose two percent. Operating profit rose 41 percent. EPS increased 48 percent. Our e-commerce sales reached a record level of 2.1b. And our free cash flow in 2002 totaled more than $500m. Despite a very difficult sales environment in North America that we faced throughout the year Office Depot posted record results both in the fourth quarter and for the year 2002. During the year we virtually met or exceeded every one of our key operating metrics. Our costs are down. Our margins are up. Our operating profit both in the fourth quarter and year-over-year is up. Operating profit on a company-wide basis up 100 basis points over 2002. We have built a significant leadership team at Office Depot which will drive our results into the future. Weve changed our culture at Office Depot. Weve invested for growth. A significant amount of earnings have been invested in growth in Europe this year and, you probably saw this morning and if you havent, we announced additional growth initiatives in Europe where we plan to launch retail in Spain in April of this year. We drove RONA. We have the best balance sheet in our business. Its got lots of cash. The metrics are very good. And when you put it in perspective of the economy and the environment were proud of our accomplishments both during the fourth quarter, as well as for the full year. On a sales basis I said earlier that our revenue for the quarter increased two percent. Comp worldwide sales were flat in the fourth quarter and for the year. And as I said earlier, e-commerce reached 2.1b, reflecting a 34 percent increase over 2001. Now, turning a little bit to more insight on the comps. Our BSG sales were up five percent in the fourth quarter, four percent for the full year. Our contract segment grew six percent in the fourth quarter, three for the full year, and weve been accelerating that business all year long. As Ive indicated to you, weve made investments to grow that business, and those growth initiatives are paying off. We did see some strengthening of our West Coast operations where weve had some weakness in the early part of 2002. Our overall catalog sales at Office Depot and Viking remained negative. We will and have made changes to manage this business going forward. Ill talk of those when we get to the North American segment. Our domestic e-commerce was up [26 percent] for the quarter, furthering our already industry leadership. North American retail comps, the number all of you want the most focus on, and Ill give you considerable insight into, were negative four percent for the quarter, and negative two percent for the full year. Furniture, technology lumped together accounted for virtually 100 percent of the negative comps in North American retail during the quarter. Ill talk more about that when I get to the retail segment. Our international sales were up six percent in dollar, in local currencies in the fourth quarter, up 17 percent in U.S. dollars, as were beginning to see now for the first time in some time benefits to Office Depot as a result of the comparisons between the dollar, the Euro, and the pound. Our strongest performance were in the Netherlands, Ireland, Austria, and Italy. International sales for the full year were up six percent of local currencies, 11 percent in U.S. dollars. On an operating profits basis full year operating profit was up 41 percent to $500m, versus 353m in 2001. We hit historical year-end high operating margins in our BSG business at 9.3 percent. An outstanding year any way you measure this business. Ill talk more about BSG in a minute. Our North American retail operating margins, excluding the increase in lease termination costs that are outlined in our release and the California wage and hour re-settlement which was earlier in the year reached 7.6 percent for the year, full year 2002. This in spite of a difficult sales environment. And we made [immeasurable] progress in making our retail stores more shoppable, a more compelling place to shop, and improved our operating metrics and our quality metrics all at the same time. 3 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call International was an incredible year when you think about what we invested to grow our business. We added three new countries. We increased the support of four new contract countries. We added contract sales forces in Italy and Germany. Added eight new stores in France. We made significant progress on reducing our operating costs in Japan. We launched nine new web sites. And we only took when we did all that a 72 basis point hit on our operating margins. We invested in 2002 more than $50m of EBIT to grow our international business. Its profitable. It has high returns. And we announced this morning further investment as we continue to drive our companys profitability. Our margins throughout the company more than offset our comparable sales softness. And of those, as Ive talked about earlier, were lower levels of technology sales. We did see improved pricing in our contract business, better pricing from our wholesalers, better cost control, and overall good G&A controls. On an EPS basis, on a GAAP basis, as I said, first quarter  excuse me, fourth quarter earnings were 21 cents excluding the charges of the North American real estate and the discontinued Australia operations which, as you know, we announced we were going to sell and we have now successfully completed that sale. We actually achieved 23 cents for the quarter of earnings, 21 cents on a GAAP basis. Included in the fourth quarter results were an $8.4m adjustment for the increases in the lease termination costs of the remaining 70 stores we closed in early 2001. At our mid-quarter update in December we talked about the likelihood of having to take additional charges for those stores. Also included in our full year results is approximately three cents for the accrual for the settlement of the class action litigation in the State of California of which many retailers have had [in their sales], and the adjustments in real estate I just talked about. North American retail stores. Fourth quarter sales, as I talked about earlier, were down three percent, comps down four, and for the full year were down one percent. Comps in North American retail were negatively affected particularly in December with furniture and technology. Furniture, technology in the broader category, by that I mean hardware, software, and communications in the fourth quarter were $57m less in the fourth quarter this year than last year. The following, the last two weeks of December were particularly soft in these categories, and as I said earlier, that virtually accounts for all of the negative comps in North America retail in the fourth quarter. Office Depot was a leader in both furniture and technology compared to our competitors. We had a higher percent of our business in these categories long before our competitors did. We suffer more of a difficult comparison as a result. And these had been the primary factors weighting on negative comps, both in the fourth quarter and throughout the year. The average ticket in North American retail was down about one percent, again reflecting lower furniture and technology sales. Comp transactions were down, as well. Our customer service indexes, those indexes that we measure customer performance, were up. We opened seven new stores in the quarter, relocated one. And at the end of the year we have 867 office supply superstores here in North America. On the retail operating profit side store operating profit hit 6.3 percent in the fourth quarter, 7.6 for the full year. And excluding the impact of the California wage and hour suit, the litigation I talked about, and the increase in the lease costs our gross margin has improved 42 basis points during the fourth quarter, and 170 basis points for the full year. Thats partly a shift away from technology. Its also disciplined category, SKU, and product management. Its the increased reliability we have on private label products and globally imported products which have allowed us to remain competitive at the sale price level, and take higher margins as a result of some of our buying skills. Our operating costs in retail remained tight throughout the quarter. When you negative comp four percent, as most of you know, it puts tremendous pressure on fixed costs and you get some de-leveraging. But in spite of that our payroll was up only slightly, our complaints were down, our service was better. And as I said, retail, particularly in light of a difficult environment really from our perspective had an outstanding year from a profitability standpoint. There isnt any question that our highest priority at Office Depot is to grow our North American retail sales. I will comment on that when I talk about the outlook going forward. 4 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Business Services Group, which I talked about earlier, had truly an outstanding year. Sales in the quarter grew five percent. Our contract sales grew the fastest. We continue to invest in this segment. We believe were gaining share. We believe well continue to grow this business going forward. We made substantial improvements in our operating costs, and Ill talk more about it in a minute. We have, weve done some things to accelerate growth in our Office Depot and Viking catalog brands. Were going to combine the leadership of those two brands under one leader. Were going to put that leadership in Delray Beach, Florida. And we believe weve identified very specific, measurable initiatives that will cause that business to grow in 2003. Were seeing some early signs of that now. Its  the full year is ahead of us, but were confident we can grow this segment. The growth in the contract business we think is market share gain, predominantly in the East, but we did see substantial improvement in the West. Our contract average order size is up a slight bit. Thats an encouraging sign as it was down earlier in the year putting difficulty in our warehouses. Our domestic e-commerce business grew by 26 percent during the quarter, continuing the leadership position we have in e-commerce, both domestically and internationally. On the operating profit basis, this business hit a record 9.2 percent operating margin for the fourth quarter, up 107 basis points over last year. For the full year its 9.3 percent, 158 basis point improvement over 2001. Gross margins were actually slightly less in the fourth quarter, nine basis points as a result of the larger impact of [For Sure Dot Com] [ph] business which is growing rapidly at lower margins, and a little bit of mix to larger accounts which historically have somewhat lower margins. Our operating costs in this business decreased by 115 basis points in the fourth quarter, and 177 basis points for the full year, and thats after substantial improvements in 2001. This business is profitable, we invest in its growth, it contributes enormous profitability to our company. We believe we can continue to gain share in this business. We made improvements in our DSO, our inventory turns, and our service levels, all of which helped us achieve record free cash flow in our businesses throughout the world, and record service levels from both inventory and customer issues. On the international side for the fourth quarter sales grew six percent in local currencies, 17 percent in U.S. dollars. The exchange rates favorably impacted the quarter by about 40m and 67m for the full year, and so we did get some benefit. The biggest benefit of which was in the fourth quarter. We do have the benefit of three new direct mail countries in our numbers, Switzerland, Spain, and Portugal. Switzerland and Spain in the early part of the year, Portugal late in the fourth quarter. We have ramped-up contract sales in four countries. We added two new countries in contract; Italy and Germany. We added eight new stores in France. We have a new warehouse in France to support the growth. We have nine new websites, three of them, six Viking direct, and three BSD Net. We substantially improved our operations in Japan. Weve combined to one single brand. We reduced our operating losses by almost 50 percent. Japan is still a challenge. We are encouraged by some of the signs we see in Japan. A number of our stores achieved profitability in Japan at the store level. We continue to believe we can make Japan work. An important part of our future, albeit well still sustain losses in Japan in 2003. On the operating profit basis internationally, gross margins increased by 11 basis points primarily attributed to better buying, global purchasing, and some private label products. Also, 18 basis points on the full year, basically the same story. Operating costs on a year-over-year basis did increase, but they do reflect the tremendous investment I talked about earlier to grow our existing business in Europe. Weve said all along that Europe is the primary focus of our international growth. We are a significant player in Europe, want to be a bigger one. We believe we can do this and continue to grow our business both cash, profitability, return on sales, return on investments. We did complete the sale of our Australian operations in the first quarter of this year, and so that transaction will be recorded in our first quarter results. So Australia was successfully sold to Cole Myer, and so our results have excluded Australia on an ongoing basis. And so weve presented our results for ongoing operations. 5 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call In summary, as we look to both the quarter and the year we faced enormous challenges, economically here in North America, some challenges in Europe, as well. But as we look back we basically promised or delivered all that we promised, either met or exceed. Were proud of our accomplishments. We are highly focused on continuing to grow RONA, to keep the best balance sheet in this business, to continue to generate enormous free cash flow in spite of investing for the future. We have a Leadership Team Im extremely proud of. We certainly have a challenging environment short-term, both in North America and potentially outside the United States given the world events. But were more optimistic than ever about a our long-term ability to grow this companys sales and earnings in the ranges weve outlined which is long-term growth of at least 15 percent EPS. What Id like to do now is turn a little bit more to our outlook for 2003. We are six weeks into it from a perspective. One of our enormous challenges is to predict for you and us what the economic environment is going to be like, and what that means to us. All of you would like us to be able to predict EPS within a penny or two. I would remind all of you that basically EPS with us is about a $5m number. And so, to predict EPS within two or three cents youre asking us to predict in January what EPS might be like within $15m. Its challenging. Its challenging for us, challenging for you. But lets take a look at our overall assumptions for 2003 at this point in time. We do not see encouraging signs particularly here in North America of an improving economic environment. The signs we say still say that small and medium-sized businesses which are the core of our retail business are conservative. I am not overly optimistic about the short-term future. As a result of this very early view we now believe that our GAAP EPS growth will be in the five to 10 percent range over 2000 EPS GAAP of 98 cents a share. We think EPS in the first half is likely to be flattish. For those of you that dont recall, we had a significant increase in EPS the first half of last year. And particularly the first quarter. We think our EPS growth in the first half is liable to be flattish, but will pick up in the second, a sequential improvement in the second half of the year. We do expect our worldwide e-commerce business to continue its rapid growth. We expect that business to exceed $2.5b. Now for each of the segments. North America retail, we do expect to see sequential improvement in each quarter, but we now believe that comps will be negative in the first half in the mid single-digit range with flattish to slightly positive comps in the second half of this year. Our number one priority, as Ive said to you, is to grow North America retail sales. I am sure when we end this call youre going to have an awful lot of questions on how were going to do that. I am not going to be as specific as you would like, but I will tell you that we have identified significant things we believe we can do in the immediate near future to grow North American retail. This management group is focused on it. Its a difficult environment, but were confident we can deliver. And when we start to deliver on those initiatives we will fully tell you what they were, what they are, where they are, and how they impact our business. But I want you to understand its our number one priority. We plan to open about 40 new stores in North America this year, predominantly focused where we have density. We intend to build-out our presence in a few of our major markets. Thats important to us because where we have density and a strong presence every other aspect of our business does well. And so, we are slightly ramping up store openings in 2003. They will be generally smaller stores, but there will be more of them. From a gross margin perspective we believe we can make small improvements in margins in 2003. Thats going to be a little bit dependent upon the shift in mix. Technology should it grow will cause margins to come down on a consolidated basis. But we do think theres small improvements in margins we continue to get as a result of our buying and pricing initiatives. From an operating margin perspective with our outlook on comps, as I have articulated, we will be experiencing de-leveraging of our costs, but we think while there will be some quarterly fluctuations compared to last year, we believe that our operating margin performance in North America retail should be very comparable to our performance this year in spite of our cautious outlook on North America comps. On the North American deliveries business we expect to see this business continue to grow in 2003 as it did in 2002, particularly in the second half. Our growth will be SKUd towards our contract business, where weve invested and believe we can take share. 6 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call We do anticipate growth in our catalog businesses, at Viking and Office Depot. I spoke earlier of some decisions weve made to more consolidate these two businesses. Headquartered in Delray Beach that means during 2003 we will be moving a number of people from Torrance, California, our Viking headquarters, to Delray Beach. We will fully integrate Office Depot and Vikings order entry systems. And we expect the cost of that integration throughout 2003 could be in the neighborhood of $10m to $20m, and thats already in our outlook for earnings for 2003. Growing our North America catalog business is our second highest priority at Office Depot. Growing North America retail is our first. And we continue to focus on that, and at the same time continue to invest in our international businesses. In North American delivery we expect mid to high single-digit growth. And we expect to continue to gain share, as I said earlier, in our contract business. Our For Sure Dot Com business, the company we acquired a year or so ago, is doing extraordinarily well. Its a virtual seller of technology to small and medium-sized businesses. Its virtual inventory, it has lower margins. As it becomes a larger part of our sales it has the impact of lowering the overall reported margin for the group. And our growth in contract in 2003 will be the biggest part of our growth. It will put some pressure on our gross margins as a result, and we expect gross margins in this segment to drop during the year between 150 to 175 basis points as we grow contract and For Sure is a bigger part of our business. On the expense side we continue to believe in spite of two years of extraordinary quality and expense improvements we can get enough expense out of our North America delivery businesses to offset any margin deterioration, and therefore, we think our operating margins will be pretty much in line with our record levels of 2002. Which I remind you were over nine percent. On the international side we expect this to continue to be our fastest growing business, and well grow in U.S. dollars, we now believe, to the mid high-teen range. This comes from consistent mid single-digit growth in our mature direct catalog business operations coupled with growth in e-commerce, as well as new country growth and new channel growth in our contract business. While weve not announced any new contract countries for 2003, as you know, we did announce this morning we will enter Spain in April with five to six retail stores in Madrid. We already have an existing operation in Spain. We have warehouse, we have call center, we have infrastructure, we have G&A, we have administration. Weve identified Madrid as the most important market of Spain. We believe we can build a significant presence of superstores in Spain. We think first mover has an advantage. Weve identified five sites. We have leases signed, and in the process of a sixth. We plan to open these stores in April or May, and start to add retail into an already existing infrastructure in Spain. Gross margins, internationally basically will feel some impact of increased prospecting, but as a result we see gross margins as a result of improvement in global purchasing and private label pretty flattish for the year 2003 versus 2002. From an operating margin basis in spite of these enormous investments in new countries, new channels, new brands, and Spain retail we think that well get in the 50 basis point range improvement in operating margins in this segment for 2003. Our capex for 2003 we now believe will be in the $250m to $300m range, slightly more than it was in 2002. And we now anticipate that our free cash flow, and something weve accelerated in, will be in the $250m to $300m range. Thats our overall outlook for 2003 as we see it the second week of February. One of the things that we started to do a few years ago was to provide you great insight into our business on a mid-quarter update. We will continue to provide you insight into our business on a mid-quarter update basis to give you more insight to how were performing. I know in a minute youre going to want to talk an awful lot about comps. And I understand why thats important. And I understand theres going to be enormous numbers of questions about what were going to do to drive them. I want to summarize and say this company in the two-and-a-half years, that in the last two-and-a-half years, has made enormous progress. We have delivered or exceeded virtually on every promise weve made.

Earnings Conference Call to our RONA, to our pristine balance sheet, to our capital ratios, to our DSOs, to our inventory turns to supply chain, and frankly, in most if not all of those categories we lead our competitors and we lead the industry. Clearly our challenge is to grow our North America retail business, and secondarily, our North America catalog business. And, again, Ill tell you we have a list of very specific by market, by geography initiatives that we believe will get North American retail comps positive in the near future. And so, with that, Id like to turn the call over to you for any questions you might have about the quarter, the full year, or our outlook in 2003. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Operator Thank you, sir. If anybody would like to ask a question, please press *, 1 on your touchtone phone. Our first question comes from Matthew Fassler from Goldman Sachs. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Company - Analyst Thanks a lot, Bruce, and good morning, and thanks for the very comprehensive overview. I have so questions, and so as not to disappoint you, the first one will involve comps. I want to reconcile the traffic and ticket discussion with the discussion of the mix shift. You alluded to furniture and technology being major culprits -- but the ticket, average ticket, was not down dramatically. If you could just give us a sense of how you comped in some of the supplies areas, and how you think about the relationship between traffic and mix. Bruce Nelson - ODP - Chairman and CEO Well, I think if you take the comment I made, Matt, that furniture and technology virtually accounted for all of our comps  negative comps  you then have to assume that the total chain comped kind of flattish. And within that, there are some different changes. And I would say core supplies did fine; some pressure on some other categories. I think traffic is one of the issues we're focused on. We've spent a lot of effort on what it takes to drive traffic in stores; we believe we can increase it. I think part of the reason why the average ticket didn't drop more in light of furniture and technology, is I think that our core customer in our retail stores  and this is really critical to understand  our core customer is not a personal user. Our core customer is a small and medium-sized business. And we have the biggest share of that business where we line up against our competitors. And I think, while they're conservative in terms of their outlook for high ticket items, I think they continue to have to use consumables, and therefore I don't think the comp transaction dropped as much as the impact of furniture and technology. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Company - Analyst Fair enough. Second real quick one. Obviously, no one in this environment is going to penalize you for sitting on a hoard of cash. But if you could give us an updated sense -- given that the free cash flow prospects remain strong, given that your cash net of debt remains very substantial  your latest thinking on uses of cash including acquisition and buy-backs, to the extent that those are [simultaneous speakers]. Bruce Nelson - ODP - Chairman and CEO Well, I should tell you, I love this question, because it's really a great position, to have to try to explain to the world how we're going to use all of our cash. It's sure a lot nicer position to be, than to explain where we're going to get some. 8 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call I'll come back and say, we said that this company was going to focus on increasing shareholder value. The way you do that over a long period of time, is you grow your business. And you grow RONA. Because there's a high correlation between companies that grow RONA and companies that grow shareholder value a la stock price. And I have promised, and I continue to promise, and if you know a lot about our organization  some of you do  we make promises I believe we can keep. And we do our best to exceed them. I have promised that we'll use the cash to generate shareholder value. My preference all along is to find ways to reinvest that cash back into our business to grow the top line, to grow our presence, to grow our market share. I've been saying that for 18 months; I'm going to say it for another 18. I don't really have any comment, nor can I comment, about the rumors circulating about acquisitions, nor do I have any comments, nor can I, about stock buybacks. My promise to the shareholders of this company  and our new management organization, and frankly, my own Board of Directors, our own Board of Directors  is that we will grow value in this company. If we can't find ways to invest that cash in our business, to grow it, we will find ways to grow shareholder value. That's a promise. We've had this problem for about four quarters, or five quarters. We continue to run our business to generate positive cash flow. We're going to generate more positive cash flow next year, and that that's kind of our view of cash. So it's hard to be more specific than that; I know that everybody would like me to be more specific, but it's all about driving shareholder value. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Company - Analyst Thanks, Bruce. Operator Our next question comes from Danielle Fox from J.P. Morgan. Danielle Fox - J.P. Morgan - Analyst Thanks, good morning. Bruce, can you talk a little bit about the competitive environment? And also, to what extent do you think rational pricing has helped margins, but hurt top line, at the Office Depot Superstores. Thanks. Bruce Nelson - ODP - Chairman and CEO Well, I think if I tried to define the competitive environment  and by that I assume you mean North America, and further by that, I think you mean North American retail. Danielle Fox - J.P. Morgan - Analyst Yes. Bruce Nelson - ODP - Chairman and CEO To define that [indiscernible; technical difficulty], I've got to go by channel. I would say that the environment in North American retail, particularly in the last six months, I think  if I say our competitors for a moment are Office Max and Staples, which are only part of the competitive set  I would say that there are more signs of some promotional activities. They tend to be focused promotional activities, either one-to-one, or offers to get people in the stores. They are not widespread; they are not across the board. And therefore, I think that is activity that's being seen. Second of all, I do not believe that our pricing has caused pressure on sales growth. I think, when you go through the process, and look at our stores, our SKU's, we're price competitive. We have to remain competitive. We have a low price guarantee. We honor it; we keep it. We have gotten 9 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call smarter, and I think our competitors have as well, about the elasticity of pricing on certain SKU's. But on key, critical, commodity-type items which drive revenue, we are priced competitive, and I don't think it's caused us to lose revenue as a result of margin improvement. There are some signs that there is more aggressiveness on promotional pricing. We did some promotional pricing in December to try and drive costs; we all do. But it's highly selective; it's highly focused; it's not across the Board, and it's not a price war, from where we sit today. Danielle Fox - J.P. Morgan - Analyst And just one real quick follow-up question on the cash. The 5 to 10 percent EPS growth guidance  that assumes that cash stays on the balance sheet; so it assumes no specific use of cash? Bruce Nelson - ODP - Chairman and CEO Yes, that assumes the cash stays on the balance sheet, that's correct. And I might add  and this might not surprise all of you  that cash is not earning an extraordinarily high rate of interest today. So it's not helping drive RONA at the moment. But yes, that assumes the cash stays on the balance sheet. And that guidance also assumes  because that's GAAP, if you will  that also makes the assumption that we will, in the year, incur in the neighbor of $10m to $20m in costs integrating Viking and Office Depot more fully. And that's in our guidance, and that'll be GAAP. As you all know, GAAP disclosure, GAAP requirements, have changed substantially, and like other things, we intend to fully comply with those regulations. Operator Our next question comes from Dan Binder of Buckingham Research. Daniel Binder - Buckingham Research Group - Analyst Good morning, Bruce. A few questions for you. First, at your recent analyst meeting, it sounded like there were strong opportunities for gross margin improvement. Given that you're planning flat gross margins next year, and you've kind of acknowledged more promotional activities; your own fliers seem to be more promotional in January  is it fair to say that as you try and drive traffic yourself into your stores, that it will be focused on very specific promotions week to week? That's the first question. The second question is on Viking, given the softness there  and I think we all know that Viking's not been the lowest priced  in this heightened cost-focus environment, is that an issue? Is it losing share on price? And then the third question is on some of the recent merchandising and consumer SKU's  if you could give us a sense of what your testing, what your thinking is, there? Bruce Nelson - ODP - Chairman and CEO I'm going to give you some insights into some of your questions and not others. Let me comment. First of all, on promotional activity. I think, while all of you would like to compare inserts, first of all, you've got to have a lot of them to compare, because we all regionally price. Two is, don't be misled by a price on an insert on a front or back page. While it does drive some business, it is not the key driver of business in North American retail stores. Third is, I'm not going to comment about what our promotional plans are. I'm just not. I mean, I've said all along we're going to grow our business; it makes no sense, in this business, to take an across-the-board price decrease to try and do it. You get highly targeted, highly specific, and I'm simply not going to comment on what our promotional plans are going forward in retail, or frankly, any of our businesses. I'll clearly tell you the impact of what we've done after we've done it. And tell you clearly what it has meant to us in both growth and other kinds of things. 10 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Relative to Viking, I think it is fair to say that the Viking model, which was basically an on-sale, off-sale model for its history, did perform extremely well. And by the way, in spite of having some difficulties grow, this is still an enormously profitable business. I mean, this is a very, very good business. It struggled here in North America to grow. And there is more price pressure on Viking, and as a result, I think some of why we're going to integrate more is to take better advantage of brand rationalization, of which customer gets what brand when. Some customers do like on and off sale. They respond better to it. Others want everyday low price. By combining the order entry systems, the data warehouses, and the information systems more fully than they provided, we think we can rationalize that, and we can grow both businesses. But the specifics of how we're going to do it, I just won't comment about. The third question you had, Dan was  I forgot? Daniel Binder - Buckingham Research Group - Analyst Regarding just some of the consumer pipe SKU's that we've been seeing in the stores lately. Bruce Nelson - ODP - Chairman and CEO Well, I don't know  it depends on which store you go and where you go. And again, I'm not going to comment  let me try this. Our core customer is a small to medium-sized business. That's the heart of our business. That's where virtually all of our SKU's are focused. We do have some stores in some markets that tend to have a higher non-small and medium-size business mix. We know where they are; we know what they do, and they tend to respond a little bit better to some other kinds of SKU's. Where they are, how many they are, and what we do, I won't talk specifically about -- but to say to you we are not losing focus of who our core customer is; we are not losing focus of getting more share of [orders] [technical difficulty] from that core customer. And it's the kind of items that customer wants to buy from us. And on the subject of tests, it doesn't make any sense on this kind of a format, on this kind of a call, to communicate in advance what we're testing and where we're testing and how we're testing it, from a competitive perspective. We live in a competitive business. Needless to say, we've got initiatives we believe can drive revenue. We believe that it will be profitable revenue. We believe we're focused; we believe we've got some things to do. When we start to see the impact of those, I will articulate clearly what we did, where we did it, how we did it, and what it generated. In the meantime, I want you to understand, we're going to do it. Daniel Binder - Buckingham Research Group - Analyst Okay. Thanks. Operator Our next question comes from Colin McGranahan from Sanford Bernstein. Colin McGranahan - Sanford Bernstein - Analyst Good morning, Bruce. Two questions. One, focusing on the North American business  North American retail business for a minute, and looking at the gross margin. Maybe if you could just give me a little better sense sequentially why it was [I think up 40 BPS] [phonetic] on a year-over-year basis; sequentially it was down considerably. How much of that is seasonality; how much of that was a more promotional environment, how much of it was mix shift  and what to expect going forward? 11 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call And then the second question is the competitive environment actually in the contract space. You sound fairly confident that you continue to gain share there; can you just comment on what the competitive environment is like, how Corporate Express is acting, and how pricing looks in the contract business today? Bruce Nelson - ODP - Chairman and CEO Sure. First of all, in the fourth quarter, historically, our margins in retail are always lower. We do some holiday advertising, holiday gifts -- I mean, so historically, over a long period of time  a long period  recent times  we always have somewhat lower margins in retail. Two is, 40 basis points to me, on an overall basis, is not a meaningful change. You get mix changes, and to try to quantify for all of you what those are, doesn't make sense. We clearly know what they are, and we're not concerned about pricing trends; that all of a sudden we've got enormous pressure on our margins. So it's really by category, and Colin, as much as I'd like to, I'll just tell you we clearly understand the mix change and where it is, and what it occurs in. But 20, 30 basis points of margin change quarter to quarter, I'm not sure we're that accurate to be able to predict mix enough to know what it is. And on that basis, when I said in 2003, back to one of Dan Binder's questions -- I mean, I'm basically saying margins could be 10, 20, basis points better. I mean, it's up or down a little bit. It's just basically, I think the real significant opportunity for margin gain for retail is primarily behind us. I think we'll still globally buy better; private label is growing faster. We have more private label in our business than it appears our competitors do, and we'll continue to leverage that. On the contract side, I would say that from where we sit, from the level we sit at, from the noise you hear in the field -- and recognize that filters up through lots of different filters  Corporate Express is highly aggressive and still remains aggressive. And that's particularly true at larger accounts. I think there's also aggressiveness on the very large segment. I look at some of the requests for quotations in the last couple of months, and take a look at what we are doing to try to earn the business and others  I'd say that's a tough environment. Corporate America is not adding jobs, and to grow this business, you've got to take it from somebody. So that's a little bit in our plan about saying that this segment, we'll have somewhat lower gross margins in 2003, as we compete more direct, if you will, on the larger account segments. So competitive  I'd describe it as very competitive, particularly at the large account level. It would appear to us that Staples is getting more aggressive on the contract side, and I say 'appear' because I don't know, but from all outward appearance, they're getting more aggressive on price at the larger account level. That's what it appears to be. Now, whether that's true or not, I don't know. Colin McGranahan - Sanford Bernstein - Analyst Thanks, Bruce. Operator Our next question comes from Michael Baker of Deutsche Banc. Michael Baker - Deutsche Banc Alex, Brown - Analyst Hi, thanks. Just wanted to discuss  I know you're not going to give away too much on the initiatives that you're talking about for North American retail -- but I'll ask two questions. Do you have any kind of time frame that you're thinking about as to when we should expect some of these initiatives to take hold? And these initiatives  are they significantly different than some of the things you outlined in December? Or is it maybe just building on those type things? And then finally, one more question  just following on someone's question earlier on the trends in the core 12 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call office products in the fourth quarter, and those have been positive throughout the year. You said that they did fine  does that mean a continuation of positive, or probably about flattish, based on some of your other comments? Thanks. Bruce Nelson - ODP - Chairman and CEO Well, first of all, on the retail initiatives  and as much, Michael, as I'd like to give all of you specifics  and I know the minute I don't, you say "Why aren't we?" -- I'm just not going to comment on the magnitude of the inits, where they're going to be, and what they're going to be. I just want you to understand we have them. And some are more of what we've done; some are quite different than what we've done. And as we give you either mid-quarter updates and/or report our progress on a quarterly basis, I'll let you know how we did. What really counts is not what we say we're going to do, and to communicate to our competitors precisely what we're going to do  and trust me, we're going to do some things  I want to wait and see, one, did they generate profitable revenue? And two, if and when they do  which I believe they will  I'll tell you exactly how they did. There are some of them that are very immediate and very short-term, in terms of actions we're taking. I want to wait and see what it means to us, and I'll let you know. On just buying side, on the supplies -- if you again, go back, Michael, and say look, virtually all of the negative comps in retail in the fourth quarter were in technology and furniture  then, by definition, the rest of the categories were flattish. Some were up and some were not. I don't want to go more specific than that. Core office supplies did fine. Did it grow as much as I'd like? No. But it did fine. So that's as specific as I'm going to get, in terms of categories. Frankly, one of the things  we break out far more by category, by segment, than any of our other two superstore competitors. I just don't want to go any deeper than that. So I apologize, but that's as deep as I'd like to go. Michael Baker - Deutsche Banc Alex, Brown - Analyst Okay, thank you. Fair enough. Operator Our next question comes from Peter [McMullin of Vineback] [phonetic]. Peter McMullin - Ryan Beck & Company - Analyst Good morning, Bruce. Three quick ones. First of all, the currency assumptions you made in your planning, if you could comment on that. Two, you've had great success with private labels. Where does that stand? Is there more room to grow that business as we go forward? And you sort of talked around it; I just wondered what the breakdown in the percentages of categories in the fourth quarter -- you know, tech furniture, etc., and if you anticipate any major changes going forward. Thank you. Bruce Nelson - ODP - Chairman and CEO Okay, on currency  just to clarify the quarter for a minute, on an income basis. We did get the benefit of about a penny a share in the fourth quarter on currency translation as a result of the dollar and the euro. We're basically, for the moment, assuming currency stays at about the same level it is. So our forecast, our outlook, if you will, assumes that the euro stays in the $1.07, $1.08 range, and the pound in the range it's in today. That's kind of our big, broad assumption about going forward. And we baked those into our plans, if you will, and so we can compare ourselves internally against last year. And those are much weaker dollars, if you will, than they were a year ago. 13 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call On private label, a couple things. One is, we believe we have the highest percentage of our sales in private label; it's more than 9. And it's growing. And there's tremendous room here. We've just hired an individual, highly experienced, and in global purchasing we think there's huge opportunity to expand our offerings in private label. We'll do it gradually; we'll do it smart; we'll do it in cooperation and conjunction with some of our key suppliers. And it's one of the reasons why we think, even if there's some pressure on selling prices, that we can mitigate some of that as a result of our size. We're the largest seller of office products in the world. And we intend to leverage that size, as we buy both in this country and outside this country. Relative to the categories, going forward, part of our cautious outlook in the first half of this year in North American retail continues to be as a result of continuing significant weakness in technology and continued weakness in furniture. That continues, and in fact, in some categories of those two  subcategories  the weakness so far in the first six weeks is exasperated. And again, I'm not going to go into the specific categories, except to say our own outlook is that we'll continue to face tough sales environment in technology. By a lesser degree, furniture, but nevertheless, that's our outlook for certainly the first half of the year, and it kind of weighs on our view of the first half of the year in North America retail. Peter McMullin - Ryan Beck & Company - Analyst Thank you. Is there some goal, long-term, on the private label? Bruce Nelson - ODP - Chairman and CEO The answer is, we have a very specific goal internally. But the goal we'll talk about externally is, it'll be a bigger percent of our sales on a go-forth basis, gradually increasing. I don't think it's appropriate to talk about the goal from a variety of aspects. We do have one; we measure it; we understand how to get it. We're focused on doing it; it'll take us a while to reach our goal; this is not a one-year goal; it's directionally where we want to go. Peter McMullin - Ryan Beck & Company - Analyst Thank you. Operator Our final question comes from Bill [Patzner] [phonetic] of Merrill Lynch Investments. Bill Patzner - Merrill Lynch Investments - Analyst Hi, guys. I wanted to ask a little bit more about  and I think maybe you've given us some clues  about the currency. Currency alone should add a fair amount of income this year, if it stays where it is, given the timing of the currency. Isn't that true? Bruce Nelson - ODP - Chairman and CEO The answer to that is we got a penny in the fourth quarter, to be specific, on the currency. So currency is going to give us a boost, but I also want to bring you back. We're heavily investing in our European businesses. I told you on an EBIT basis, we invested more than $50m of EBIT in 2002 in our growth initiatives, predominately in Europe. We just launched Spain. We've got the impact of new countries that came later in the year. We've got a ramp-up of our contract business. And so those things are offsetting some of the currency gains. I think when you then step back and you mix all that together and say, this company's is investing a disproportionate share of its cap ex -- in Europe predominately -- growing countries, channels and brands. And having said that, we still are going to report, we believe, offering profit increases. 14 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call I mean, I think it's inevitable performance. I'll also tell you that the dollar started to get weaker in our third quarter, so we really got a first half that's quite different, a third quarter that's a little different, and the fourth quarters would be about the same. So I haven't quantified exactly, precisely, at these currency rates, what the impact is, but it's probably 2, 3, cents for the year  maybe 4 at the most. If you call it 2 to 4, and remember, a penny at Office Depot is about $5m -- to get more precise than that is extraordinarily difficult to do. I think you've got to put it in that light. Bill Patzner - Merrill Lynch Investments - Analyst Okay. And so, then what you're saying is the increasing investment in other things in Europe sucks some of that 2 to 3 cents back out, because you're going to need to put money into it. Bruce Nelson - ODP - Chairman and CEO Yes, sure. Because this business is growing at double digit; it's got enormously high RONA; it generates free cash flow; it's got opportunities to grow. I mean, you talk about what separates Office Depot from our two primary North American competitors  it's our international presence; it's our international profitability; it's our multi-brand multi-channel. And the thing that's focused predominately non-retail -- although we just talked about Spain  and we intend to leverage that. I mean, as you know, interestingly enough, while we focus enormous amounts of effort on North American retail, it is less than 35 percent of our operating income. The story about our company clearly is focused on retail  I told you it's our highest priority; we're going to do everything we can to drive it. But we've also changed the complexion of this company over the last two or three years, where we focused on awful lot on delivering ecommerce, and we'll continue to do that. And that's what will drive this company's long-term future. We will find ways to grow comps in North America. Bill Patzner - Merrill Lynch Investments - Analyst Right. Can I ask one little detail? Continuing lease termination costs. Are there any projected in 2003? Bruce Nelson - ODP - Chairman and CEO Well, I don't know. I mean, that's the subject of real estate. Ideally, if I'd had a crystal ball, when we closed 70 stores, we would have had a reserve that was $50m bigger, and I'd be reporting to you that we're leasing stores at a faster rate than what we thought. So the answer is, I don't know. I mean, that's a process where you go through the remaining portfolio store by store, and you say, "What are my assumptions about that store and my ability to sublease it?" It's a more difficult environment because of all the store closings, not the least of which are K-Mart. We have put a high priority on getting rid of these properties. I have no idea today whether or not we'll have to take any additional reserve in this area or not. I don't know. We look at that on a quarterly basis; we true it up, if you will, and we come back and say, "This is our best guess." And those are our best guesses. I don't know how to answer it any differently than that. Bill Patzner - Merrill Lynch Investments - Analyst That's fine, thank you. 15 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Bruce Nelson - ODP - Chairman and CEO Thanks very much for your attention, for your questions, for your support of Office Depot. I'd summarize and say, I know, and I can hear, and I understand, all of the concern about North American retail. This company is committed to grow it. But this company also had an enormously successful 2002, and it shouldn't by overshadowed by some challenges in retail. I also might point out, by the way, in terms of leverage, and you all know this, but basically, a 1 percent change in North America retail comps in the quarter it occurs is almost a penny a share. And therefore, if you look at the fourth quarter, and say that on a non-GAAP basis we made 23 cents, in spite of the fact that our North American retail comps were, on average, 2 full points below what most of you thought, we not only made that up, we exceeded it  it should give you some insight to the enormous earning capacity this company has, when we grow North American retail, and when the economic environment begins to improve  and sooner or later it will. This is a company that knows how to leverage its cost structure, focus on the right kinds of things -- focus on a balance sheet. The leadership of this company has never been stronger and never been better. It's the first full year since I've been CEO that I'm going into a year with a fully cooked, fully baked leadership team. All the positions are filled. I think that continues to drive results. I told you about our culture; I think it's a competitive advantage. We're in a tough environment. Thanks for your support; thanks for your insights. Appreciate your questions, and appreciate the fact that you spent an hour with us this morning. To all of you, have a great day. Good day.

FEBRUARY 27, 2003 / 4:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q4 2002 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO Thank you, Hillary. Good morning. I would like to welcome everyone to Strategic Diagnostics fourth quarter and 2002 year-end investor conference call. For the first time with me is Stan Musial, our new Chief Financial Officer. Stan joined us on November 1st, 2002, and has made a significant contribution already to our senior management team. Art Koch is now focusing on his Chief Operating Officer's responsibilities which we believe will have a significant impact on SDI this year. Before I discuss the highlights of the Company's business highlights of the fourth quarter, I would like Stan to review the numbers for the fourth quarter. Stan, could you review the numbers? Stan Musial - Strategic Diagnostics - CFO Sure. Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin the review with our revenues for the year. Revenues for the year-ended December 31st, 2002, were $23.8 million versus 29.4 million in the prior year, a 19 percent decline. As we have stated throughout the year, the decline is primarily due to the significant decline in sales of StarLink test kit sales from record sales levels in 2001. Rick will discuss further the revenue opportunities and outlook for 2003. Now turning to operating expenses, manufacturing expenses, which include cost of goods sold, totaled $12.3 million in 2002, down from $14.5 million in 2001. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower StarLink related sales volume in 2002. Gross profit, that's total revenues less manufacturing costs, decreased $3.4 million, or 23 percent, to $11.4 million, and gross margins declined to 48 percent in 2002 from 51 percent in 2001. The decline in gross margins is primarily attributable to reduced utilization of the Company's manufacturing capacity as compared to 2001 as a result of the lower sales volume during 2002. In order to facilitate the production of our recently released products and leverage the Company's manufacturing capacity and improve its production yields, the Company instituted several initiatives late in the fourth quarter 2002 and early in the first quarter 2003. One such effort is the elimination of a separate test kit in antibody business units, resulting in a single manufacturing organization. Research and development expenses increased $344 thousand, or 12 percent, to $3.3 million in 2002, primarily due to continued investment in the animal feed test and the lateral flow food pathogen test. These expenses will remain about the same in 2003 as the Company continues the development and introduction of new food safety products. Selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately the same in 2002 as in 2001, at $10.3 million. These expenses are expected to decline in 2003 as the Company has taken action to streamline its operations, including creating a single sales and marketing organization which had previously been organized in three distinct teams in the water bodies, food safety and antibody product categories. After interest in taxes, the net loss for the year was $912 thousand, or five cents per share, compared to a year-ago net income of $1.1 million, or six cents per diluted share, which again included record levels of StarLink. Turning to the balance sheet, the Company had cash of - had cash at December 31st, 2002, totaling $2.1 million, up from $1.3 million at September 30th, 2002, as (ph) the Company turned accounts receivable into cash to a net decrease in receivables of $747 thousand for the period. The Company's current assets total 14.4 million and its working capital, that is current assets minus current liabilities, stood at $12.5 million at December 31st, 2002, compared with $11.9 million at December 31st, 2001. Our current ratio, that is the ratio of current assets to current liabilities, stood at 7.6 at the end of 2002, compared to 3.8 at the end of 2001. At December 31st, 2002, the Company had stockholder's equity in excess of $30 million. Also, with regards to our banking relationships, the Company has received a waiver of the loan covenants for 2002 and has amended the loan covenants to a minimum quick ratio of 2.25 and a minimum tangible net worth of $22.5 million for the first three quarters of 2003. Rick, those are the comments I wanted to highlight and I'd like to turn it back to you. Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO Thank you, Stan. 2002 was a year in which we saw significant change. We announced in late 2001 that we were acquiring the Microtox system, entering the food pathogen test arena and consolidating the San Diego, California, facility into our Windham, Maine, facility. We start 2003 with Microtox becoming an established technology in the municipal drinking water facilities, SDI's E. coli O157 pathogen test being recognized and utilized by many of the industry leaders, and the consolidation of the California facility complete. As we position the Company for further expanded growth, we encountered a year of operating losses. However, we believe that the year 2003 will demonstrate that these were wise investments. 3 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

FEBRUARY 27, 2003 / 4:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q4 2002 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call Now switching to the individual business units, revenues for the water quality category increased in 2002, primarily due to the increasing sales of the Microtox toxicity testing system. Today, more than 50 North American Water systems, most of these - which serve greater than 100,000 households, currently utilize this system for drinking water. Several recent developments highlight our success with the Microtox technology. These include the 2002 Business Achievement Award from the "Environmental Business Journal". We received this award for our work in developing the Microtox technology into an effective Homeland Security technology. In its announcement of the award, "EBJ" stated it was awarding SDI the Homeland Security Award for "... rapidly deploying the Microtox technology it acquired from AZUR Environmental in 2001 to water quality security applications. Used predominantly for wastewater and research prior to 9-11, SDI developed additional protocols and application notes and as of the end of 2002, Microtox is being used by more than 50 major drinking water utilities across the country." We feel this is a great accomplishment. We are also very pleased that the largest private drinking water facility, American Water Company, after an extensive evaluation of the Microtox system, has elected to purchase the Microtox system for each of its facilities. Lastly, we have also made significant strides in having Microtox adopted in the food and beverage industry. We are already seeing early adopters of this technology in this industry. This, we believe, could become a significant opportunity to SDI. Switching to the food safety segment, in the food safety arena we have seen also many very exciting changes. Today we released our screen test for the detection of meat and bone meal in animal feed. The meat and bone meal in animal feed is linked to the transmission of BSE, more commonly known as mad cow disease. This test, which we are calling FeedCheck, was designed in a lateral flow format to be more sensitive and easier to use than any other rapid on-site method available today. We developed this test throughout 2002 to meet the regulations throughout the world. This test was supported by McDonalds and we expect this test to have broad applicability throughout the beef and dairy industry. In January we released our salmonella test. This test has several advantages over competitive methods, including a simplified preparation process that makes the test easier to perform versus any other competitive brand. The product performance standard that we have set with this product meets all of the necessary regulatory requirements. Recently, the Company has submitted the salmonella test for third-party validation by the AOAC Research Institute and have also initiated key evaluations which are underway. The initial feedback from these evaluations is very positive, much like what we were seeing with our E. coli test at this stage. I think the most important development, though, is what we are indeed seeing with the E. coli test. In July of 2002 we launched the RapidChek lateral flow test for E. coli O157. Since that time, several feed (ph) evaluations have been performed by major independent laboratories. The results from these evaluations have prompted a globally recognized food safety laboratory corporation to begin a nationwide implementation of the SDI RapidChek E. coli O157 test. This corporation (ph) expects full implementation to be complete by the end of March of this year. We have also seen a leading global food service provider complete a full in-depth study of our test. In that test they found that our test provided them with about 65 percent fewer false positives, which is a key point in this industry. They have also started to endorse this test throughout their whole system and we also expect this to be complete by the end of March of this year. These developments have immediate impact to our revenue and profitability. And lastly in the food safety area, I want to point out that we're seeing a continued rise in all of our GMO sales, except for - and SDI still maintains its dominant position in this testing industry, having greater than 90 percent of market share. Switching lastly then to the antibody segment, we see that the antibody segment revenues declined slightly in 2002 as we completed the consolidation of the San Diego, California, facility into a single site at Maine. But since the consolidation, we have seen several new or expanded relationships that have been established in the latter half of 2002 as our customers and new prospects have the opportunity to validate the manufacturing quality procedures that we have used at the Maine facility. We believe that these relationships will develop into increasing sales as the antibody division earns additional projects under these relationships. We also project that the Bayer clinical device Repinotan, the device that SDI is providing to them, we will see that Repinotan Phase III clinical trials will conclude this year, 2003. We believe that all the numerous changes which we have made will result in each quarter throughout 2003 exhibiting increased growth in both revenues and profitability. At this point in time I would like to open the conference call to questions. Thank you. 4 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

FEBRUARY 27, 2003 / 4:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q4 2002 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Operator Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question at this time, please press the 1 key on your touch-tone telephone. If your question has been answered and you wish to remove yourself from the queue, please press the pound key. And if you're on a speakerphone, please lift the handset before asking your question. One moment for our first question. Our first question comes from Don Littlewood (ph) from Littlewood Burke (ph). Don Littlewood - Littlewood Burke Morning. I have a couple of questions. Number one, under the GMO, Monsanto just announced their root worm seed. Have you - I take it you have some involvement with that? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO We do, Don. We have actually worked on that particular program for I believe three or four years now. We have worked with Monsanto and others in the development of this seed to get it to commercialization. As that project is launched we expect to see increased sales in the grain market. Don Littlewood - Littlewood Burke That would include test kits beyond just selling to Monsanto? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO That is correct. Don Littlewood - Littlewood Burke OK. Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO That is correct. I believe in the Monsanto announcement they talked about the Dow and DuPont products. We have also been working with those particular programs for corn root worm also. Don Littlewood - Littlewood Burke Excellent. Onto the food safety. Let's talk about water quality. Beverage processors, do you have any at this point or customers? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO We have several evaluations going on with different beverage processors. Many of these are very large global processors that are evaluating the technology to implement in all of their facilities. 5 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

FEBRUARY 27, 2003 / 4:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q4 2002 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call Don Littlewood - Littlewood Burke State governments, there was some talk about working - you were working with several state governments about getting statewide regulations or mandates as far as this test is concerned. Is that still in gear, is there any progress there? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO There is significant progress. Actually I heard yesterday or the day before that one of the states has elected to implement the Microtox technology across the whole state and we have many people at SDI that are working with them in putting those units in place. Don Littlewood - Littlewood Burke Excellent. What about our local water utility here in the Philadelphia area which is now expanding nationwide, Philadelphia Suburb (ph), and that's now the second largest non-municipal water company? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO We obviously without permission of any individual facility cannot define whether we are or are not working with them. Don Littlewood - Littlewood Burke But you did with American Water company. Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO Because we got their permission. Don Littlewood - Littlewood Burke OK. Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO Hopefully, everybody can recognize that many of the facilities are hesitant to allow their names to be used because it is advertising that basically they are using this technology. Don Littlewood - Littlewood Burke It might make their water users feel a little more comfortable if they would tell people, wouldn't it? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO I agree with that statement. 6 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

FEBRUARY 27, 2003 / 4:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q4 2002 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call Don Littlewood - Littlewood Burke Listeria test, when would you expect that to be coming out? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO The listeria test is expected to be introduced in the beginning to latter part of third quarter of this year. Don Littlewood - Littlewood Burke OK. And lastly, can you explain to us a little bit about the reading instrument for the salmonella test? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO I believe somewhere around September of last year we announced that we had initiated the working with a large company in development of a reader. This reader is designed to read all of our lateral flow tests, whether it be salmonella, E. coli, listeria or GMO. The advantage of it, this particular meter, is that it takes away the subjectivity. A lot of times when a person is reading a lateral flow strip they have to - if they see a very faint line, say, is that positive or not? Now you have an instrument read and also with that instrument read, it can - that result can identify the sample and you put it into a limb (ph) system as to whether that sample was positive or negative. We see that this will be a significant advantage in the industry for the pathogen testing and for many of the other types of tests that we are introducing. Don Littlewood - Littlewood Burke And when does that - when do you expect that to be available? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO We expect that to be available sometime in 2003. Don Littlewood - Littlewood Burke OK. Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO Instrument development, we have now shown that the instrument works, the cost of production is very reasonable. It's working out all of the software kinks in that system. Don Littlewood - Littlewood Burke Good. Thank you, Rick. You've done a very good job of explaining what the Company's up to. Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO Thank you. 7 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

FEBRUARY 27, 2003 / 4:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q4 2002 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Chekinow (ph) from Sidoti. Mark Chekinow - Sidoti Morning, gentlemen. Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO Morning, Mark. Mark Chekinow - Sidoti Back to the water business, you mentioned that the American Water, the private utility, is going to be on emergency case, so this would suggest that this is, at least in the immediate terms, just unit sales, not necessarily the recurring revenue portion. Can you talk about the ballpark number of units that American Water's going to be taking on as well as about how many units the food processor will be taking on and your expected, I guess, economics of that? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO With the American Water works it's my understanding that there is somewhere between 15 and 30 units that are expected to be placed. They are over a sequential timeframe and there is a reagent stream that's associated with them. They have worked out a sampling protocol that's based on a certain formula that they have generated and will be using a reagent. Now it's not test three times a day every day, but there is a reagent stream associated with that. With the food processor that we're working with, they have completed their evaluation, they are quite pleased. They have had several audits from people that they supply that have comments (ph), and has really given us the visibility in this industry. The expectation is from their chain that we will see somewhere in the placement of 10 units. But there are much larger chains now that we are penetrating that could be, you know, several hundred type units in the system. Mark Chekinow - Sidoti And your average selling price, is this still talking about around $20 thousand per unit? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO When somebody is looking at larger units, we're obviously going to discount that down. Mark Chekinow - Sidoti OK. In addition now, you say you are in discussion with several other food and beverage processors? 8 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

FEBRUARY 27, 2003 / 4:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q4 2002 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO We are. Mark Chekinow - Sidoti Larger than the ones you have currently signed? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO That is correct. Mark Chekinow - Sidoti OK. Switching to E. coli, so you have this - what appears to be fairly significant endorsement. Has there been any resistance in switching from a competitive product on the end of any of the suppliers? And what do you expect, I guess, competitors of this large food service provider to do in response to that - to this kind of large industry changing switch? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO Several questions embedded in there. Do I expect push back? Yes, I expect push back. We - no facility, even with a recommendation, wants to switch overnight until they do their evaluation. We are seeing everybody doing those evaluations. Everybody to my knowledge to date, after that evaluation, when it's compared to other lateral flow type devices, have concluded that our test is indeed easier to use, demonstrates less false positives, and is more sensitive. So we're pretty pleased with those results and we are seeing people steadily switch over. Mark Chekinow - Sidoti OK. And lastly to kind of - could you do the revenue breakdown from the quarter? Between the food safety, water and antibody? Stan Musial - Strategic Diagnostics - CFO For the quarter? Mark Chekinow - Sidoti Yes, for the fourth quarter. Stan Musial - Strategic Diagnostics - CFO Let me start out with the year. The revenue breakdown for the year was about 7 million in water quality, about 6 million in food safety which is GMO, and about 10 million of antibodies, and the balance being what we call contract revenue for specific R&D projects. For the fourth quarter, we had about 1.7 million in water quality, 1.9 million in food safety, 2.7 million in antibodies, and the balance in contract revenue. Mark Chekinow - Sidoti Great. I'll hop back in the queue. Thanks. 9 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

FEBRUARY 27, 2003 / 4:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q4 2002 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Laurie Bernstein (ph) from Oakwood Capital. Laurie Bernstein - Oakwood Capital Hi, guys, how are you? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO Very good. And yourself, Laurie? Stan Musial - Strategic Diagnostics - CFO Hi, Laurie. Laurie Bernstein - Oakwood Capital Good. Several of my questions were answered already, but I still have a couple. Can you - you have talked about the economics of the water testing previously. Is it - are they still occurring as you expected? Can you address what's actually happening currently now that - now that you're, you know, selling to 50 different facilities? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO I understand your question. If the question was are our margins on the Microtox reagent and Microtox instrument where we expected them to be six months ago, the answer is yes. We - on the reagent we have a very high gross margin, on the instrument we have somewhere between 50 and 60 percent gross margin. Laurie Bernstein - Oakwood Capital And how about, you know, the number of reagents that you're selling? How many facilities are buying, you know, maybe three times a day, how many are not, how many are buying occasionally, and what is your ASP on the hardware? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO What we expected in the beginning of the year 2002, was we said that if a facility bought they most probably would use between $10 and $15 thousand a reagent per year for that facility. For most of the facilities that has been right around where we're seeing. Laurie Bernstein - Oakwood Capital OK. And how about the ASP? Stan Musial - Strategic Diagnostics - CFO On the Microtox unit? 10 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

FEBRUARY 27, 2003 / 4:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q4 2002 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call Laurie Bernstein - Oakwood Capital Yes. Stan Musial - Strategic Diagnostics - CFO It ranges from $15 to $20 thousand depending on the size (ph) of the sale. Laurie Bernstein - Oakwood Capital OK. And you mentioned that increasing profitability, increasing revenues and profitability over the next several quarters, do you expect to be profitable in the first quarter? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO Laurie, as you know, we have resigned from giving individual quarter projections. My expectation is that philosophy will change towards the middle part of this year. As we establish the E. coli and salmonella and ruminant test, as we establish the water sales, we should have a much better visibility than we've ever had because we are now in industries that we don't have to develop. Therefore my push for our organization is to be able to provide the quarterly guidance starting with third quarter this year. Laurie Bernstein - Oakwood Capital OK. The GMO area, Monsanto and their announcement about the root worm GMO, aside from that, you mentioned that you've had increasing sales. Can you flesh that out a bit and talk about where you think the industry is right now and your role in it? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO OK. When we started talking about GMO testing, I think the Company's position always was that the - where the very large bonanza for testing would come is when we had the introduction of output traits. Output traits are where you and I benefit from them, therefore you and I would pay the premium on the output traits. The input traits, where the farmer benefits, you know, has created a certain amount of market for our test on two sides. One is in the testing of seed. As we announced in our third quarter press release, we believe we are now supplying all the significant cottonseed producers with the GMO test, we're providing it to many of the corn and soybean producers on the seed. They use the test to make sure the trait is there. We are seeing growth in GMOs and, therefore, we are seeing growth in that seed industry. On the grain side, or where we're testing to make sure that we can differentiate GMO from non-GMO at this point in time, we have also seen an increase in that business. Part of it is because there are now more GMOs out there. You know we have the Monsanto tri-3B (ph) or corn root worm trait that's being introduced, we had the Dow tri-1F (ph) which SDI has the only test out there for at this point in time. As these are introduced into the market we are seeing continued growth in that. But more importantly for us, what we are seeing is the acceptance of GMOs, which means that there will be the introduction of the output traits before several years go by and that's where testing will have to occur to be able to segregate that material so that it can capture the premium price. Our role is one where we are still working with every major ag biotech company. We believe we have tests in place for all of these significant GMOs that are out there today and for the ones that are in the pipeline. We still have, I believe, greater than 90 percent of the GMO testing market. 11 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

FEBRUARY 27, 2003 / 4:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q4 2002 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call Laurie Bernstein - Oakwood Capital If you have all of the corn, I mean all of the cottonseed market and many of the corn seed growers, it seems to me that your GMO revenues should be moving up nicely, you know, while you're waiting. Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO The overlay of all of that was that, as you know - and we had the incidence of StarLink, or CRY9C. When that occurred, where CRY9C was found in the food chain, every load of material was tested that went into food; and it was tested with our test. Now as that is steadily declining, you've got that big decline overlaid with the increase in the other traits and that's where, you know, net-net, it was a negative for last year. Laurie Bernstein - Oakwood Capital OK, but aside from that CRY9C, it should be increasing nicely. Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO That is correct and that's what we're seeing. Laurie Bernstein - Oakwood Capital And could - I'll get off after one more question. Could you explain the multiple test per strip that you mentioned, how that works... Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO OK. Laurie Bernstein - Oakwood Capital ... for the animal seed? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO In the test for meat and bone meal for the feed, in Europe as an example, the regulation is all meat and bone meal is not allowed. Meaning if it comes from poultry, if it comes from fish, it's not allowed. In the U.S., the regulation is if it comes from mammals it's not allowed, but if it comes from poultry it is allowed. What we elected to do was put a test together, one line says, alright, it's not mammalian, the other line says its not - there's no presence of meat and bone meal. So we have two separate lines to tell you two different pieces of information. Laurie Bernstein - Oakwood Capital OK. Thank you very much. Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO Thank you, Laurie. 12 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

FEBRUARY 27, 2003 / 4:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q4 2002 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Cole from Matador Capital. Steve Cole - Matador Capital Good morning, guys. Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO Morning. Steve Cole - Matador Capital I had a couple of quick questions. One, let me turn back to GMO for a minute and try to pin you down on a number here. If you exclude StarLink, what was the sale experience for the year and the quarter? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO Now you're working for our competitors and want to give them all our knowledge? Steve Cole - Matador Capital Oh, we never want to do that. You know that. At least a rough idea, I mean, are we up, you know, 20 percent, 30 percent, 10 percent? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO I believe we're up about 30 percent for other than StarLink. Steve Cole - Matador Capital Other than StarLink. OK. StarLink, if we go to '03, is StarLink - if we look at '02 - let me back up. In '02 what was StarLink's sales? I presume you still had a little bit. Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO We did. We did. Steve Cole - Matador Capital OK. So is StarLink - when we look at '03, is StarLink going to disappear altogether? 13 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved. Republication or redistribution of Thomson Reuters content, including by framing or similar means, is prohibited without the prior written consent of Thomson Reuters.

FEBRUARY 27, 2003 / 4:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q4 2002 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO I don't think we'll see StarLink disappear altogether. I do believe from '03 to - from '02 to '03 we will see a more decline in StarLink. But obviously it's not going to have the same pronounced effect in our numbers that we saw in '02. Steve Cole - Matador Capital OK. Now I'll put you on the spot on something else. You've got three areas that, if I'm hearing you right, that are - you've got E. coli, salmonella and the ruminant test, three tests that should start ramping up in '03. I know we talked a little bit about this last year, but do you have current information on two things; one being the market size, or opportunity in those markets, and number two, the penetration rate that you think you can get and by what period? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO OK. Let me do the first one which is the easy one, E. coli. With E. coli it's about an $8 million market. We believe that we can obtain a substantial portion by year-end. What is a substantial portion? I believe I made it in my - the last conference call that if we could not get 20, 25 percent of that market by this year-end, I will be disappointed. Steve Cole - Matador Capital And you're talking on a run rate basis? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO That's correct. Steve Cole - Matador Capital OK. So for an absolute year you're - you know, if we talk 20. So less than two - less than a couple million bucks, so it could be $1 million, $1.5 million? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO Right. On the E. coli market. Steve Cole - Matador Capital Yes. Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO Now salmonella is a much larger market. Steve Cole - Matador Capital OK. 14 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

FEBRUARY 27, 2003 / 4:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q4 2002 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO In - it's projected that of the $180 million market for pathogens worldwide, salmonella is about 60 percent of that. So obviously, salmonella, there's a large opportunity there for us. Steve Cole - Matador Capital OK. Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO As you know, we have just introduced this test. We're just starting those third-party evaluations, so it's really hard to project a ramp rate. Steve Cole - Matador Capital OK. I mean, if you had to guess - well, let me phrase it - let me put it a different way. That 180 million market today, how concentrated is it from a testing perspective? I mean, how many tests are out there? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO For salmonella there are, it's probably five or six dominant tests out there. Steve Cole - Matador Capital OK. Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO And then there's probably another ten minor ones out there. Steve Cole - Matador Capital And given what you're saying and the indicators and performance and cost and everything else, you believe that you could be comparable to one of the dominant testing companies or one of the tertiary ten testing companies? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO You know I never want to be a tertiary company. Steve Cole - Matador Capital That's the right answer. If you had to guess - let me phrase one last question on this. The five or six dominant tests, how big - how big are they if you had to guess today? I mean, are they each, you know, $20 million or how do you segment those two groups? 15 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

FEBRUARY 27, 2003 / 4:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q4 2002 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO There is one company, BiomaryU (ph), that has an instrument-based test that I believe is, I mean, assay wise, the largest - has the largest market share. My guess would be somewhere between 20 and 30 million. Steve Cole - Matador Capital 20 or 30 million? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO Yes. Steve Cole - Matador Capital OK. And after that does it fall off dramatically? Like of those other four or five, are they - are they 15 million or how far does it fall off? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO They keep falling off, you know. The next one down might be 15 million, et cetera. Steve Cole - Matador Capital OK. So bottom line is, you know, without getting into too specifics, you'd be disappointed if you couldn't get up, I presume, within a couple of years in the five to 10 million range. Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO I would be disappointed. Steve Cole - Matador Capital OK. And how about on the ruminant test? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO The ruminant test is one that is where we were with GMOs two years ago or three years ago. If you do the math one way, it can be a very large market opportunity. You do the math the other way and it can be a lower market opportunity. Until I'm out there for three months, I don't want to target one or the other. We believe we have by far the right test, we're working just like we did with the GMOs, we're working with all the European and U.S. regulatory bodies, we're working with the market leaders, the opinion leaders, to get ourselves established as technically above everybody else and any other test that's out there, so we're putting all the same things in place that we did with the GMOs. Steve Cole - Matador Capital OK. 16 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

FEBRUARY 27, 2003 / 4:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q4 2002 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO I will feel much more comfortable on the June conference call saying where I see this market going. Steve Cole - Matador Capital So the issue, Rick, you know, when we look at Biorad (ph), I know we talked about the different types of tests, I mean the dead carcass effort, you know, they call it the - I always think of it as the dead carcass test, but things like Biorad (ph) where they're testing after the fact, is this - I take it you see this market really being bifurcated, where there's going to be two parts of it with the test - that test will still exist I take it, this will not serve as a replacement? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO Right. What that - what Biorad (ph) has is a test that actually looks for the prion (ph), the causative agent... Steve Cole - Matador Capital Yes. Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO ... for BSE. Steve Cole - Matador Capital Yes. Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO It is only - they only can test after the animal has been slaughtered; they take brain tissue. There is - that is a test that can be used to prevent it into the food supply, but it really doesn't' work for the prevention of spreading. All of the world's regulatory bodies have put in place a rule that says you basically can't take rendered material and put it in feed. That's how this disease spreads. Steve Cole - Matador Capital Yes. Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO What we're doing is have that test to help put that firewall up to prevent the spread of BSE. Steve Cole - Matador Capital OK. And last question, I understand Neogen (ph) I think had a test that was similar, but the preparation time - the preparation process was worse. How do you see - have you seen any acceptance of that test out in the market and how do you see yours comparing to the alternative? 17 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

FEBRUARY 27, 2003 / 4:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q4 2002 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO Again I hate to talk negatively about people's tests, but it's my understanding that in the U.S. the regulation is for mammalian meat and bone material. Steve Cole - Matador Capital Yes. Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO Included in that is things like deer, elk, other species that have scrapies (ph) or are known to transmit BSE. It's my understanding and I personally have not done the testing, their test does not pick those particular items up and, therefore, really doesn't match the regulation. Steve Cole - Matador Capital OK. Let me flip over to water for one quick sec. Can you break down the split between hardware and reagent roughly for the year or quarter and how do we see - or how do you expect that mix to alter as we go into '03? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO If you could ask the question one more time? Steve Cole - Matador Capital Yes, I'm sorry. What I'm trying to get at is if we look at Microtox and water applications, what is the - what has your experience been between hardware sales and reagent sales and how do we expect that mix to change, if at all, looking to '03? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO I believe that the reagent sales has outpaced the hardware sales because we have many on the established base. As the established base continues to grow, the expectation is reagent sales will continue to be a higher percentage of that. Now, there could be aberrations to that. If, you know, some large multinational company decides that it wants to establish 100 units across all of its facilities worldwide, that equipment sales could be very large that quarter. Steve Cole - Matador Capital Yes. OK. And last question, on Microtox you mentioned a state recently is going to purchase these. Large state, small state, have they made any public disclosure on purchasing them and what applications are they using them for? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO They have not made a public disclosure. Obviously, we're going to try to get a public disclosure, but again, you know, for security reasons, a lot of people are resistant to that. They are a relatively large state as far as land mass. 18 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

FEBRUARY 27, 2003 / 4:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q4 2002 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call Steve Cole - Matador Capital OK. And last - how many units do you - are they used for water supply testing or what are they planning on using them for? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO They're being used for supply testing as well as for - they're using a combination of the field unit and the laboratory unit. Steve Cole - Matador Capital OK. And how many units do you think - have they given you any indication on number of units or what's been provided for in their funding? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO It's my understanding that it'll be plus-10. Steve Cole - Matador Capital Plus-10 units? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO Yes. Steve Cole - Matador Capital OK. Very good. Thank you very much. Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Springer from Target Capital Management. Steve Springer - Target Capital Management Yes, good morning. I'd like to ask first for what you're budgeting for '03 for gross margins and SG&A levels. Stan Musial - Strategic Diagnostics - CFO Steve, without giving specific numbers, as we had talked about in my discussion earlier as well as indications from Rick, there's a few factors I want to point out. Number one, we consolidated our manufacturing capability into one single unit to capitalize on the talents that we had in those two 19 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

FEBRUARY 27, 2003 / 4:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q4 2002 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call units as well as to increase our attrition season (ph) in producing those products, so you can - so we can drive margin to a higher level from where it has been in the past in operating two separate units. Secondly, with the introduction of newer products, there's the expectation that they're going to drive higher margins because they are newer and that will have an impact on the margin improvement over 2003 as well. On the SG&A side I had indicated that we believe it's going to decline year-over-year in terms of absolute dollars because of some of the initiatives we've taken, including the consolidation and reorganization of our sales and marketing effort. Steve Springer - Target Capital Management OK. Could you - could you give us a sort of a rundown of - by product line of what your experience is in penetrating international markets? You have a new initiative in Europe, I believe, and if you could go through Europe, Asia and South America, what's going on in these various product lines? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO With each of the product lines there is a different distribution system that we have set up. As you mentioned, Steve, we do have the - a European office. Heading up that European office now is one of the original founders of SDI. With our water, Microtox, the outside U.S. market has been very strong. Europe has indeed placed many units and has a lot of recurring sales on the Microtox unit. The E. coli test has - we have not put a major push in Europe for that particular test because they have a different problem type of bacteria. They have E. coli O123, which is different than the O157 that we have. So we didn't think it was appropriate to really put a lot of marketing effort into that particular E. coli test. However, with the salmonella, we see Europe as a big opportunity; we are putting in a major push. In Asia, in Japan, we have significant sales on the products like the seed products for GMO testing as well as the E. coli testing. So each country, each product, has had different pushes. We do believe, with GMOs as an example, that we have worldwide push. Some of the - we have developed some products for outside U.S. almost exclusively. Toasted meal is the concern in Europe; they love (ph) to test toasted meal for GMOs and we have developed a product that is specific for that market for them. We believe international is very important for us. Steve Springer - Target Capital Management Yes. What percentage of your sales in the last quarter were where it came from international? Stan Musial - Strategic Diagnostics - CFO About 35 percent, Steve. Steve Springer - Target Capital Management Yes. And do you expect that to stay about the same in - for '03? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO We do. Steve Springer - Target Capital Management OK. You had mentioned, I believe, on the last call, Rick, that you had indications of significant indications of interest in the BSE test from overseas. Is that continuing? 20 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

FEBRUARY 27, 2003 / 4:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q4 2002 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO For the what test? Steve Springer - Target Capital Management The BSE test, the mad cow test. Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO There is a lot of interest that has been expressed. As to how much that is going to translate in actual sales, until we're out there pushing, you know, I don't want to say, hey, it's going to be $100 million today. Steve Springer - Target Capital Management Well, that happens to coincide with the number that McDonalds mentioned to you, doesn't it? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO We have never quoted McDonalds as mentioning a number. Steve Springer - Target Capital Management I'd like to get back to asking about Repinotan and I understand that superstock investor, Charlie Logia (ph), reported that he had had a conversation with management in which management indicated that Bayer had suggested that the Company, SDI, should be prepared to produce a million tests. Is that correct? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO The expectation, to my understanding of where they see Repinotan doses per year to be, is in the million neighborhood within the first couple of years. Every unit dose requires a - one of SDI's tests. Steve Springer - Target Capital Management And these tests would sell for about ten bucks each, is that right? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO That is where we are today. Steve Springer - Target Capital Management So what we're talking about there is if this product gets approval and if these numbers were to materialize, we're talking about sometime in the first couple of years of annual sales on the order of 10 million bucks, which as a percentage of the existing business today is a significant percentage, which is one of the reasons why I continue to pursue this subject. It's my understanding that having gotten to the - close to the end of a Phase III 21 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

FEBRUARY 27, 2003 / 4:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q4 2002 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call trial that's been going on for years, my question here is, is it the Company's view that the technology contained in this test, that is to say in the point of treatment diagnostic test, is proven; our technology, not theirs, ours. Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO Absolutely. We believe that we have proven this technology already. That one can take a drop of blood and get a very precise, is my concentration of a particular -- above or below a certain threshold. And as you know Steve, we are pushing this technology to many different pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies. And as you also know, there are many patents that have been applied for with this particular technology. Steve Springer - Target Capital Management How many patents? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO I believe there are two or three that are intertwined (ph) for this technology. Steve Springer - Target Capital Management Now how many other products are actually in test, that are testing right now in the pharmaceutical business using this point of treatment diagnostic test? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO We are working with a couple other pharmaceutical companies at this point in time. Some things have come and gone where they've elected that, "Gee, it doesn't make sense to continue with this particular drug." Or "Gee, it doesn't make sense to continue with this particular program." The diagnostic device is the easy part in the system. As you know, we're talking hundreds of millions of dollars from beginning to end with a therapeutic drug and very few make it from beginning to end. So if you start with a hundred, one might make it. Steve Springer - Target Capital Management Well, doesn't it - do you still regard a substantial market opportunity for this Company - in offering this product to pharmaceutical companies whose products have been - had to be withdrawn from FDA trials because the level of toxicity for some recipients of their drugs is too high, let's say between five and ten percent. For the other 95 to - 90 to 95 percent the drug would work or the treatment would work, but there's a disqualifying level of toxicity. And so they have to withdraw those products from FDA trials after having spent perhaps as much as $100 million just to get to Phase I trials. Do you still view that as your prime market? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO We always held that to be a significant opportunity for SDI. What is differentiating from this particular market and something like salmonella or E. coli, we control how we penetrate and how fast we get to those markets with our efforts. When we're coupling our tests with a therapeutic drug, unfortunately we have no control of that process. Therefore, we do not like to build expectations around something that we have zero control over. 22 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

FEBRUARY 27, 2003 / 4:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q4 2002 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call Steve Springer - Target Capital Management Well, I understand. But what I'm trying to establish here is that our product - we know that our product works. You've applied for patents. Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO Absolutely. Steve Springer - Target Capital Management And so now I'd like to ask, you said that your work - that you've - that there are a number of other pharmaceutical companies, you're working with a couple now. How many other people, how many other companies are you talking to about this product? How aggressive - in other words, how aggressively are you pursuing this product line? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO We pursue it extremely aggressive. As you know, the antibody business, which we have - really serves every single diagnostic and pharmaceutical company out there, therefore, we have sales reps that are in these people's facilities all the time. We continue to bring up this opportunity. Many people have heard it, have discussed it, but again, what they're looking at is making a $400 million decision, "Do we pull this off the shelf and start down this process again?" We have been in a lot of different presentations and we continue to push this technology. I am a very strong believer in this technology. Steve Springer - Target Capital Management Are you seeing a gain traction, do you think that you're getting a better reaction? Are you - what is your - what is your level of optimism about getting into more products? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO I believe over time we will get into several other products. I think the market is going to wait to see how Bayer does with Repinotan. Because it is a different thought process that you need a test to help you dictate what the therapeutic concentration is going to be. Steve Springer - Target Capital Management But nobody is questioning the validity of the test? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO Nobody has tested the validity of the test. Steve Springer - Target Capital Management OK. Last question is, you've mentioned that you're in about 50 utilities currently. Is that correct? On the Microtox test? 23 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

FEBRUARY 27, 2003 / 4:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q4 2002 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO At year-end we were in greater than 50 utilities. Steve Springer - Target Capital Management OK. What percentage of these utilities - I mean, you referenced American Water which is using it on a specific threat basis, I guess, or on an emergency basis. What percentage of these utilities are using the Microtox test on a daily basis? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO I believe the 50 that were in that at year-end were all using it on a daily basis. Steve Springer - Target Capital Management And what would be a typical profile of the usage? In other words, how many times would they be testing, what would that entail in terms of recurring revenues? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO I believe we're seeing the $10 to $15 thousand a reagent per facility. Steve Springer - Target Capital Management Per facility? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO Per facility. Steve Springer - Target Capital Management So year-end 50 utilities, how many facilities is that? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO That's 50 facilities. Steve Springer - Target Capital Management Oh, so it's not - is it 50 different utilities - 50 different companies or 50 different facilities? Stan Musial - Strategic Diagnostics - CFO 50 water systems, which would be facilities. 24 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

FEBRUARY 27, 2003 / 4:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q4 2002 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call Steve Springer - Target Capital Management OK. How many different companies are you in? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO I have no clue to that answer. Most of these are individual city municipalities, so I would venture to guess it's very similar to that number. Stan Musial - Strategic Diagnostics - CFO Some of them have some multiple units, but many of them have single units. Steve Springer - Target Capital Management And do you - these utilities have to respond by the end of the year to the fed about what they're doing to address the threat of water contamination. Is that correct? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO That is correct. Steve Springer - Target Capital Management And are you seeing - are they - are they responding now or do you think that they're going to be waiting until closer to the end of the - is it September or the end of the year? Stan Musial - Strategic Diagnostics - CFO End of the year. Steve Springer - Target Capital Management End of the year. Do you think it's going to be - there's going to be a rush at the end or how do you see that playing out? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO I imagine it's identical to tax filings. There are those that are early birds, there are those that push it right to the end, and there will be those that will - won't comply and will be late. Steve Springer - Target Capital Management But do you think that it's going to mean that when they do - when they do respond that there's going to have to be some sort of plan to protect the water by testing? 25 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

FEBRUARY 27, 2003 / 4:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q4 2002 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO I do. Steve Springer - Target Capital Management OK. Thank you. Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO Yes. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from John Fitzgerald from Bishop Rosen & Company. John Fitzgerald - Bishop Rosen & Company Gentlemen, good morning. Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO Morning, John. John Fitzgerald - Bishop Rosen & Company Maybe a little more of a pragmatic question. You had indicated that you had consolidated your marketing department, OK? And I assume it's broken down into the food and the water sector. As you start to walk out more and more product lines, OK, what accompanying increase in the size of your marketing department are you planning, how much has it increased, let's say in the last six months, 12 months, to basically, you know, increase your penetration factor into the various new product markets? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO The changes in the sales and marketing organization have really been a shift a little bit in focus. As you know, four years ago we were primarily in the pesticide remediation business. Back then we said, gee, we see for the Company to continue to grow we need to shift away from that a little bit because of the fact that it's what I call the once and done testing. And on a remediation site you test and test on that site and once that site is remediated, it goes away. That's why we said alright, we're going to switch into some of these other markets and we, you know, discussed then the water toxicity and the food pathogen. John Fitzgerald - Bishop Rosen & Company Rick, what methodology of marketing are you basically utilizing? Are guys going - you know, guys and girls going out there and hitting the bricks, are you doing mass mailing, telephone campaigns to reach municipalities and various food companies? Elaborate a little bit on that. 26 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

FEBRUARY 27, 2003 / 4:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q4 2002 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO OK. We use a combination of the technical ads in technical journals, mass mailings. As an example, yesterday we sent out a mass mailing to all the food and beverage companies about Microtox, I believe there was somewhere around 16,000 of those sent out. We have the outside sales reps that follow up, we have the inside folks that are pushing the trade shows and working with the decision makers and the opinion leaders, all of the trade groups, the consortiums, that type of thing. We have a very, very active tradeshow participation. I think this week we're at three different tradeshows. John Fitzgerald - Bishop Rosen & Company Do you plan an incremental increase in your marketing department? Now you got two new products, you got salmonella coming, you got this ruminant, you know, where do you stand on the size of this department and, you know, what your budgetary plans are for increasing the size of the marketing department? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO We have... John Fitzgerald - Bishop Rosen & Company If any. Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO We have continued to change it, not as much increase it because we have found efficiency. One of the things that was part of this most recent change is we felt that we needed to staff it with a lot more of inside technical support people; we needed E. coli experts and we needed salmonella experts. And we brought them on board and we found that we didn't need as many people out in the field and we pulled back a little bit on that. So we're changing the combination; it doesn't necessarily mean that we're growing the size of it, but we believe we are far more effective. John Fitzgerald - Bishop Rosen & Company Thanks. One follow up question on what Steve Springer said about the European - Miss Cavanaugh's (ph) been put in charge there; how has that progressed since she's been put in charge over there, what inroads are being made, what expansion penetration is being made in the European market? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO She has identified in several countries very high quality distributors that we are working with now. We believe that that will increase some of the penetration. She has identified - the toasted meal product, products that fit better for the European market. She knows how to work with the folks here because she is intricately familiar with the operations here and getting those products out and over there to fit the market better. John Fitzgerald - Bishop Rosen & Company OK, you've answered my questions. Thank you. 27 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

FEBRUARY 27, 2003 / 4:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q4 2002 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Clinton (ph) from CE Unterberg. Brian Clinton - CE Unterberg Hi, guys. I'll try and - I'll try and keep this short. First, I know you had said you were going to be giving some more guidance for '03. Any revenue guidance at this point? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO We don't want to get into specific numbers for the first couple of quarters. As I said, I believe very strongly that as we enter the established markets, that by mid-year we should be able to get some good idea of run rates and help out with those projections. Brian Clinton - CE Unterberg OK. The second - the second question is on FeedCheck. Is there a validation process that these - that the users would need to go through that might be similar to the ones they were doing with E. coli or salmonella? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO It's more difficult to do the third-party evaluations by the individual companies with FeedCheck because right now they aren't really using anything. So that's why I likened it to the GMO market where what we started with the GMO was working with folks like Defra (ph), JRC, different government regulators to say "Yes, this test works, this test meets what they are saying it does", and then go work with the companies in implementing it. Brian Clinton - CE Unterberg OK, so that's something that we - that's still going to be - it's still going to be awhile before we see some - see some meaningful revenues for FeedCheck? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO That is my assumption. Brian Clinton - CE Unterberg OK. Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO Now we have worked with and sent this product off to many of the different regulators and the feedback that we're getting is tremendous. We had one group that had a whole series of blind samples, everybody else who has sent samples to them have performed miserably on those samples and we got every one of them right and they were shocked. 28 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

FEBRUARY 27, 2003 / 4:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q4 2002 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call Brian Clinton - CE Unterberg OK, so that's something that could speed up the time to adoption for some of these companies. Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO That is correct. Brian Clinton - CE Unterberg OK. As far as salmonella goes, that test was launched in January. When do you expect companies to complete evaluation of that and initiate use? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO My original expectations were somewhere in the neighborhood of the June timeframe. However, what we're seeing is because so many people have evaluated our E. coli test and have been so pleased with the results and so astonished by how good they are, that many people are testing the salmonella test and their evaluations at a much more rapid rate than what we saw with the E. coli conversion. So we might start seeing as soon as the March, April timeframe some people starting to convert over. Brian Clinton - CE Unterberg OK. And so with the listeria now expecting to be launched sometime in the third quarter, would you expect that timeframe to be the timeframe where the companies are going to evaluate and then decide to use it? Is that something we may see revenues then in the first quarter of '04? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO Yes. Brian Clinton - CE Unterberg Or maybe closer to the... Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO First... Brian Clinton - CE Unterberg ... second quarter? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO ... '04, right. I was thinking fourth quarter. We, you know, with listeria it's a little bit different market than the salmonella, E. coli market, so some of this might be different customers and therefore might take, you know, the same three or four month timeframe. So will we have meaningful listeria sales in this year? Probably not. 29 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

FEBRUARY 27, 2003 / 4:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q4 2002 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call Brian Clinton - CE Unterberg OK. Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO I will say again though, the - you know, last year at this time we were an unknown in this market. In June, we were - when we introduced the E. coli, we were an unknown. It took awhile for people to know who we were, but right now the word out there is pretty favorable and a lot of people are looking at our tests as high quality. Brian Clinton - CE Unterberg OK. And my final question has to do with McDonalds. Do you expect them to issue any mandates or policies concerning the use of any of your tests? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO You know I do not like to speak for third-parties. Brian Clinton - CE Unterberg Yes. Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO That'll get me in a lot of trouble, so I will decline making any comment on that. Brian Clinton - CE Unterberg Alright. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from Mark Chekinow (ph) from Sidoti. Mark Chekinow - Sidoti Just wanted to talk real briefly how you did mention that the bank covenants have been waived. One, are you currently in compliance with these covenants. First, are you in - compliance? Stan Musial - Strategic Diagnostics - CFO Yes. 30 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

FEBRUARY 27, 2003 / 4:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q4 2002 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call Mark Chekinow - Sidoti And what would you say your confidence level is now that you are more on a balance sheet driven covenant as opposed to earnings covenants? Stan Musial - Strategic Diagnostics - CFO We are confident that we will be in compliance with those covenants at the end of the first quarter. Mark Chekinow - Sidoti OK. And again, we have - we are definitely not giving any type of ballpark ranges for - I know you're not going to do quarterly, but on an annual revenue basis yet? Or is there some type of guidelines you feel comfortable giving? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO Not at this point. As I've mentioned earlier, we do expect to see increase in profitability and revenues each and every subsequent quarter. Mark Chekinow - Sidoti Starting from you were not profitable this quarter and you expect first quarter, second quarter, third quarter to be sequentially better as we go along? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO That is correct. Mark Chekinow - Sidoti OK, thank you very much. Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from Steve Cole from Matador Capital. Steve Cole - Matador Capital Yes, two quick questions, guys. The 10 to 15 thousand reagent number that you're using, is that per year per facility? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO Yes. 31 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

FEBRUARY 27, 2003 / 4:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q4 2002 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call Steve Cole - Matador Capital Oh, OK. And the other question is with Art now focusing in on the task of - on the operating role, can you maybe speak to a moment on what types of things he's working on? We know about the facility consolidation, but in terms of expenses, has he identified things that he can take out or what type of magnitude are we talking about? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO With many of our programs, we feel that there is significant opportunity in consolidating the use of single raw materials instead of multiple raw materials to lowering and leveraging our suppliers to increasing the efficiency of our processes and to automating those processes. You know, I told Art I wanted ten percent increase - or ten point increase on the gross margins; he laughed at me. We're - we expect big things out of Art, like we've always. Steve Cole - Matador Capital OK, very good. If ten points - does he laugh at five points? Thank you very much. Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from Steve Springer from Target Capital Management. Steve Springer - Target Capital Management Yes, I'd like to say that I appreciate the greatly increased level of detail, both in the press release and on this call. I think it's very helpful. Stan Musial - Strategic Diagnostics - CFO Thank you. Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO Thank you, Steve. Steve Springer - Target Capital Management Rick, on the last call, last quarter, I asked you about other new technologies or other new products that you might have in development and you replied that there was something that you were working on that had "potentially explosive" implications. You declined to give much - any real further information about that, but you said that in future calls you would. And so I'm wondering if you can give us any more color about in general what you're working on there? 32 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

FEBRUARY 27, 2003 / 4:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q4 2002 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO We are working on that same program, Steve. We have continued to work with this particular company; it's a multinational company, many billions of dollars in revenue. It is along the - it would closely match into our agricultural type tests. We have - they're looking for both the development of a field test, that they feel is where this blockbuster would be, and in a laboratory test that they would use across all of their facilities. We have continued and made significant technological advances in developing this product. They believe this will give them significant market advantage and therefore do not want any disclosure as to the particular project until they are ready and we are ready to release with them this particular product. Steve Springer - Target Capital Management And what sort of timeframe are we talking about? Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO We are hoping that we will have completed and demonstrated the effectiveness of this by the September, October of this year timeframe. Steve Springer - Target Capital Management Wow, that's great. OK, thanks very much. Operator Thank you. Once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question at this time, please press the 1 key on your touch-tone telephone. There are no further questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to turn the program back to you. Richard Birkmeyer - Strategic Diagnostics - President and CEO We thank you everyone for joining us in our fourth quarter conference call. We look forward to this year where we will have many exciting developments as our new products are introduced into this market. Thank you. Operator Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.

Mitchell Caplan - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - CEO, Director Thanks, everybody, for joining us this afternoon. A word on process for today in going forward. Our prepared remarks will be brief and we will leave ample time at the end for questions. Over 20 years ago, E*TRADE was founded with this simple principle: Use innovative technology to provide superior financial products and services. Along the way, we have experienced all types of economic conditions, from a rationally exuberant bull markets to exceedingly pessimistic bear markets. We have added new components to our business to better serve our customers. In 2000, we added a retail bank that had been built on exactly the same principles of value and technological advances. That bank is now the eighth largest savings bank in the country. We have added or built strategically to capitalize on natural cross-sale opportunities and to produce scale and 2 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Earnings Conference Call deficiencies, and throughout we have remained committed to our core tenet. We have always and will always aspire to create customer value and competitive advantage by being faster, cheaper, and better than our competition. And so, while there are a greater number of parts than in the old days, or as compared to a monoline brokerage or bank, our motto remains simple and opportunistic. We offer brokerage, banking and lending products to retail, corporate, and institutional customers, all built around a low-cost technology infrastructure. We manage risk through strong, conservative credit policies. Our diversified model provides downside protection in difficult times. More importantly, the complimentary nature of our businesses provide greater upside through scale, efficiency and cross-sell. Moving forward, we remain committed to do our principles of value and innovation. We will continue to add businesses in scale as opportunity presents. And when appropriate, we will exit those activities that do not conform to our core tenets. We will be rigorous in delivering results while building long-term value, and we will continue to build on our vision to reinvent and redefine the industry. It is in this context that I'm pleased to announce that in the latest, of what has become a string of very difficult quarters for the economy, we generated reported earnings of 6 cents a share, or 10 cents per share from ongoing operations, a non-GAAP measurement. These results are consistent with street consensus. Len will walk you through the financial details in a few minutes. Again this quarter, we have demonstrated the value of diversification. While brokerage revenue continued to show the impact of a challenging equities market, interest and fee income from banking activities produced some of the best results our banking segment has experienced to date. Let me now turn briefly to our brokerage and banking businesses. In Detroit Securities Brokerage business, we are concentrating on increasing market share and creating cost efficiencies. For the third quarter in a row, based on industry numbers released for January and February, showing a decrease of approximately 15% in the industry, we have increased market share demonstrated by our decline in average daily transactions by only 6% for the entire quarter. We have done so by focusing on the active trader segment with our targeted promotion of the Power of Nine value proposition. In early March, we began the second phase of this campaign, introducing competitive pricing on margin rates and option trades for qualified investors. Since launching this new campaign, margin balances among active traders has increased, and active trader option trading, as a percentage of total active trader trades, has increased 12%. Our ongoing focus on operating efficiency has given us a lower transactional and fixed cost structure, translating into real operating leverage throughout the business. To this end, we can increase earnings per share by a penny per quarter in a number of ways, including producing an additional 10,000 transactions per day, increasing margin debits by $300 million per quarter or reducing our cost structure by 2%. This focus on lowering fixed costs and eliminating redundancy across complimentary retail, institutional and corporate businesses has created one of the lowest cost operating structures with down side protection and some of the greatest upside leverage in the industry. At E*TRADE Bank, we are concentrated on widening net interest spreads while carefully managing and limiting credit risk. To achieve our goal of wider spread, we continue to take a balanced approach of asset diversification and liability cost reduction. Each incremental 15 basis points on our bank net interest spread contributes earnings per share of 1 cent per quarter. This quarter, our net interest spread increased to 152 basis points, a 12 basis point improvement over last quarter. High mortgage prepayments and the limited availability of asset portfolios that met our stringent credit requirements, partially offset the 20 basis point spread gain we saw from our expanded consumer loan portfolio. Carefully managing the credit quality of our assets will always take priority over increasing net interest spread. At the same time, that same low interest rate environment that has driven high prepayment and has held in check our ability to widen interest spread, has been a great benefit in our direct and indirect mortgage origination business. Over the first quarter, we generated a record $2.5 billion in direct retail mortgage originations and over $1.2 billion through our correspondent business in mortgage whole loans. We also are carrying $1.2 billion of direct originated mortgage whole loan product locked in the pipeline into the second quarter. Our diversified model continues to drive cross-sell success. During the quarter, 41% of our FDIC-insured, deposit products, 26% of our mortgage products and 38% of our home equity products sold came from cross-sell. The value in cross-selling opportunity continues to represent a significant one for us. For example, if we can increase the number of households in our base that purchase our lending products by just 1%, we could generate 3 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Earnings Conference Call incremental earnings per share of up to 3 cents per quarter. We are lowering our cost of funding by continually improving the value proposition we offer our customers. This focus has generated growth in transaction deposits, both quarter over quarter and year over year, same quarter. Transaction deposits grew by $318 million, 58% of net new deposits in this quarter for banking, bringing our total transaction deposits to $4.6 billion, which is over 51% of our total deposit base. We believe that it is extremely rare, if at all possible, to find a unique way to extract consistent and recurring value from loans on the lower end of the credit spectrum. Accordingly, we have chosen to lend to only the higher credit end of the market, and virtually all of our loans are secured by mortgages or consumer assets with conservative loan-to-value ratios. For example, our mortgage product has an average LTV of 67%, while our home equity product has an average LTV of 78%. We maintain adequate reserves, which represent the equivalent of 12 months for expected losses in both our mortgage and consumer loan portfolios. As a result, we have been able to keep our losses well below industry average. Our chargeoffs for the quarter total 21 basis points on total average assets, well below the OTS fourth quarter industry average of 34 basis points. The credit quality of our asset portfolio remains strong, as demonstrated by the weighted average FICA scores for our mortgage and consumer portfolios, holding solid at 724 and 728, respectively. All told, this past quarter again validated the power of our concept and though it is difficult to get too excited about today's equity markets, it's easy to be confident in our model. We have a great foundation on which to build, and a 20-year legacy from which to draw. The management team and I are dedicated to improving both short- and long-term value for our customers and shareholders. We are disciplined in driving initiatives that fulfill our vision and in eliminating businesses or products that do not. Over the last 90 days, we have conducted a comprehensive evaluation of our businesses, products, and services. Every business, initiative, and investment was reexamined for consistency with our goals of value and innovation and for adequate profitability. This process has generated opportunities for cost reductions over and above those that we will naturally derive from smart applications of technology. In the next three months, we will be finalizing a restructuring plan that will be implemented over the next two quarters. The plan better aligns our cost structure with our vision for the company and with current business conditions. At the same time, it also maintains the infrastructure required to achieve the company's full growth potential when general economic conditions improve. The restructuring plan has two major elements. First, we will be exiting unprofitable locations, including our E*TRADE Financial Center in New York and certain international locations. We will also be consolidating underutilized facilities and reducing square footage in our Menlo park and Rancho Cordova offices while remaining committed to maintaining a presence in these cities. Second, we will be exiting and writing off unprofitable product offerings and initiatives; specifically, stock baskets, E-adviser and personal money management. None of these were making an adequate return to justify continued investment of capital and management time. We expect this restructuring plan to result in approximately total pretax charges of up to $120 million over the next two quarters, or up to 20 cents per share. These actions will allow us to achieve additional pretax cost savings estimated between $40 million and $50 million, or 7-8 cents annually. The plan is designed to enhance short, intermediate, and long-term profit performance. More importantly, it is designed to ensure that we continue to be an efficient, effective, competitor. The associated savings better position us for continued sluggish economic conditions and create additional operating leverage when the markets return. As we continue to develop our business, we are maturing our business practices. As Len walks you through the numbers, you will see that we are committed to providing transparency into our model and our results. We are providing a new segment breakout of our fully allocated brokerage and banking segments. We have provided additional metrics in our press release, including transactions per account per quarter, EBITDA, and interest coverage, to name a few. In the second quarter, we intend to break out compensation in benefits expense in our earnings release as a precursor to our transition to a natural accounts, expense-reporting format over the next few quarters. Last year we heard shareholder concern around corporate governance arising from compensation issues. This troubled us deeply because it drew focus away from the continuing success of our model and from the work of our dedicated employees. We have acted strongly to remedy these concerns. We split the office of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, and we recently announced the appointment of four new unaffiliated and independent outside directors to our board. With Bill Ford and Peter Chernen's departure, and upon shareholder approval, our board will consist of nine independent directors and one inside director, well in excess of NYSE, SEC and Calpers guidelines. 4 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Earnings Conference Call Our new directors bring distinct financial services expertise and relevant experience needed to provide outstanding corporate oversight. They also comprise the newly reconstituted compensation committee. The intent of our structure is to ensure that the board remains completely impartial in reviewing, evaluating, and guiding the company's business at arm's-length to better serve our shareholders. In addition, every member of the management team has agreed to a realignment of compensation, including components in metrics with all plans being approved by the entire board. All of the changes that I have discussed might seem new, but they are, in fact, a rededication to those principles upon which we were founded. We have traditionally been lean and efficient, and we have always aspired to be a customer champion. We are passionate about our business and moving forward, we will ensure that our dedication to corporate excellence matches our dedication to customer and power. Now to Len for the numbers. Leonard Purkis - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - CFO Thanks, Mitch. This quarter we generated total net revenues of $322 million. That's an 8% decline from last quarter and 3% decline from the same quarter last year. This decline is largely related to reduction in brokerage revenues, partially offset by an increase in banking revenues. Cash and accruements for the quarter totaled $975 million and precash totaled $402 million this quarter, a $35 million increase over the fourth quarter. Precash, as we define it, represents cash held at the parent and excess regulatory capital of bank and brokerage and is a metric use by management in measuring business performance. Beginning this quarter, we are adding in additional cash flow-related metric, EBITDA to supplement the GAAP cash flow presentation in our 10-Ks and 10-Qs. The definition and reconciliation of EBITDA to GAAP net income is in the metrics section of our earnings release. EBITDA, for the quarter, totaled $79 million. That's a 23% decrease over last quarter and a 12% decrease over the same quarter last year. While lower on a comparative basis as a result of reduced income, it remains strong, generating debt service coverage of nearly seven times. As you will find detailed in our press release, provision for loan losses totaled $10 million versus net chargeoffs of $9 million. This quarter's provision is up slightly as expected reflecting the different composition of our balance sheet. Our reserve now exceeds $29 million, an increase of more than $1 million over last quarter. For the quarter our total reserves to nonperforming loans equaled 119%. That's up from 104% in the fourth quarter and a 48 percentage point increase from 71% to last year, same quarter. Now, brokerage revenue for the quarter totaled $177 million, a 17% decline from last quarter and a 21% decline from same quarter last year. This decline is a result of a significant reduction in trading activity during the quarter, impacted both at retail and institutional businesses and lowering commission and transaction revenues. Now, banking revenue for the first quarter totaled $145 million. That's up 7% over last quarter and up 36% over same quarter last year. This increase is related to a growth in net interest income and an increasing gain on sale of originated loans partially offset by declining gain on sale of loans held for sale and other securities. The increase in net interest income is a result of widening interest spreads and an increase in average bank assets. The growth and gain on sale of originated loans is a direct result of the continued success of our direct mortgage origination business and the addition of our consumer finance business Ganis. The declining gain on sale of loans held for sale stems from our decision to retain more of our correspondence flow in comparison to the fourth quarter. And while we continue to anticipate a decline in mortgage revenue generation when interest rates rise and refinancing volume's slow, we also expect to offset declining mortgage revenue with high-interest income, both from higher spreads and a larger overall balance sheet. On the expense side, in accordance with our guidance, we show a slight increase in cost of services and, in general, an administrative expense primarily as a result of the full quarter expense associated with the Ganis acquisition. This increase was offset by a reduction in selling and marketing expenses, and marketing in our institutionsal business as a bearable component, and with the reduction in institutional revenue, came a current from the decrease in expense. 5 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Earnings Conference Call We've included in the press release the presentation of our new segment recording format. The segments brokerage and banking include, for the first time, the full allocation of corporate overhead and marketing expense and reflect the way that we manage our business. We will make available on our website the new segment recording format for the four quarters of 2002, in addition to the quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year comparisons in the press release. This segment format illustrates that in 2002 the brokerage segment was able to deliver solid profitability throughout the year. Brokerage represented 65% of annual revenue and 43% of the full year's operating income. Now, banking segment represented 35% of annual revenue and 57% of operating income. Quarter 1 of 2003 saw the banking segment deliver $44 million of operating income, flat with last quarter. The brokerage segment with transaction volumes continuing to be under pressure generated $8 million of operating income in quarter 1 versus $25.7 million last quarter. In summary, on a reported basis, the company's first quarter net income equaled $21 million, or GAAP earnings of 6 cents per share and earnings for longer end operations were 10 cents per share, in line with street estimates. Now, turning to guidance for our second quarter, we see no external events that will act as an impetus to change. Indeed, we've already seen trading activity decline year over year and quarter over quarter, well below our anticipated average daily transactions for the year. Should trading activity continue to decline, we will be challenged to find ways to accelerate efficiency initiatives and find other sources of revenues and to offset additional lost revenues needed to meet or exceed our original guidance from ongoing operations of 45-55 cents per share for the year. The equivalent on a GAAP reported basis will be EPS of 30-40 cents per share. Nevertheless, we are reiterating our original 2003 guidance prior to the restructuring charges of up to $120 million or up to 20 cents per share expected to occur over the next two quarters. In closing, a few key messages. The company's two segments, brokerage and banking, are both profitable. Our balance sheet is financially sound, and our reserves are adequate. We continue to use technology to create customer value and competitive advantage. This focus has created one of the lowest cost operating structures in the financial services industry. Our cost structure coupled with our complimentary suite of products provides downside protection in difficult times and enhanced profitability in good times. And finally, we are dedicated to excellence in corporate governance. With that we'll now open up this call to answer your questions.

Once again, ladies and gentlemen, to pose a question or a comment please press the numbers 1, followed by 4 on your keypad. Our first question of the evening comes from Justin Hughes with Jeffries. Justin Hughes - Jeffries Good afternoon. You spoke quite a bit about how you estimate that you had picked up market share in the brokerage segment and I was wondering if you could break out the darts for us by month for January, February, and March. Leonard Purkis - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - CFO Justin, it's not something that we break out monthly. I think what you've seen from the other areas of the sector that give out their monthly data, that we're no different from them. We've seen gyrations within the quarter. We've had days where we've had transactions as low as $57,000 and we've had days where we've had transactions as high as $115,000. So it was a very unusual quarter in terms of a lot of volatility in the highs and lows that we saw in the transaction volumes. 6 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Earnings Conference Call Justin Hughes - Jeffries How about could -- I guess maybe a little more to the point, could you tell us how march was versus February since nobody's reported March numbers yet? Leonard Purkis - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - CFO Again, Justin, we prefer to let the other guys come out with their numbers and, you know, it's one of the things we're considering as we go to natural accounts as to whether that's something we want to do in the future is come out with monthly data. Justin Hughes - Jeffries Okay. Mitchell Caplan - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - CEO, Director Conceptually, Justin, what I would tell you is if you looked -- and one of the things we are considering, as you know, is beginning to report monthly dart. In the meantime, I would tell you that if you looked at our performance month by month and for the quarter, if you see a decline of 6%, that was pretty much in line each month as it compared to our competitors in terms of our consistent outperformance. So when you looked at how much market share we picked up, what we saw was it was pretty consistent month over month and ending with a final decline of 6% compared to lots of estimates in the industry of it down anywhere from 12-21%. Justin Hughes - Jeffries Okay. On the bank side, I notice that your deposit growth -- well, you had deposit growth for the first time in several quarters, as well as account growth, and I was wondering, you know, if you are doing something differently there or is that in any way related to Ganis? Mitchell Caplan - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - CEO, Director Let me turn it over to Arlen, but the first thing to note is we did show growth last quarter, as well. So this is our second quarter of growth in the area and I would say at a high level, it really isn't Ganis. It's singularly focused around the deposits, as you well know, with people being very focused on FDIC insured, very focused on safety and protectionist security and looking to move money into bank deposit accounts. So we clearly benefited from that. As well there was significant spending and marketing around it but let me have Arlen walk you through the details. Justin Hughes - Jeffries Okay. Arlen Gelbard - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - CBO, President E*TRADE Bank Yeah. I mean, on the account growth, yes, there was (INAUDIBLE) coming from Ganis but, you know, we really saw some substantial growth particularly in the deposit accounts. We had inflows and outflows, but the thing that we found, you know, most heartening is that it's clear to us that our value proposition is catching on, particularly as we look to stressed and increased growth in transaction accounts. I mean, on an account growth basis, our transactional accounts accounted for almost 707%# of the net growth and transaction deposits, of all of our net inflows for the quarter represented 58% of all of our deposits coming in. So transaction counts -- transaction deposits, overall, are at a solid 51%. Could see these being 49 but, you know, we're seeing that increase quarter over quarter. So we were pleased with that. 7 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Justin Hughes - Jeffries Okay. And then on the $120 million charge, what's that primarily related to? Is that primarily real estate or is that right off of capitalized software? Mitchell Caplan - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - CEO, Director It is not primarily real estate the way you are thinking about it in terms of a facilities restructuring for our employees. There is a real estate component, for example, in exiting the New York E*TRADE Financial Center. We're looking at all of our centers. So to the extent that we would exit any of our centers because they are too large, there could be a component there. Otherwise, it really is the discipline of exiting products that aren't successful, but I'm going to turn it over to Jarrett and let him spend a few minutes talking with you about the restructuring charge. R. Jarrett Lilien - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - President, COO Hey, Justin. Just reiterating what Mitch said, it's not being driven by facilities. Being more driven by good practice, and it's an ongoing practice that we will continue or we always look at our businesses and review them and make sure that they are living up to, you know, their promise. And so at this point, we've been looking at the touch-point strategy and, yeah, we've got something like the New York Center, which is a little too big, and the ideal size for us would be something smaller, more like 3,000 square feet. So we'll be looking at refining that and moving on there. Internationally, we've got some bright spots in international, more on the active trader side, but then we've also got some areas that just aren't pulling their weight and we'll finish the review. If they are not living up to their promise, we will exit those areas. And then we've got some products that just haven't taken root. Namely, that the PMM and the baskets and the E adviser, just things that customers didn't respond to. They cost us money to keep, and they take management time, and it's time and money better spent on other projects. So that's really the heart of it. Justin Hughes - Jeffries Okay. So when -- like, if you are exiting stock baskets, is the, you know, the charge you are taking there, is that because you are laying off people that were dedicated to that product, or is that because there was some type of software that was capitalized? I don't imagine it would take up any facilities. R. Jarrett Lilien - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - President, COO Yeah, on something like that, there's not a facilities component at all and that gets back to what Mitch is talking about. A lot of this is more just looking at products and activities that we were involved with, and did they make sense for us today. Justin Hughes - Jeffries Okay. So it sounds like it's mostly the capitalized investment that you had in those products, being software, whatever else? R. Jarrett Lilien - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - President, COO Yes. Justin Hughes - Jeffries Okay. 8 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Leonard Purkis - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - CFO Hey, Justin, we're going to have to let some other guys ask some questions. You can come back later. Justin Hughes - Jeffries Thanks. Operator Thank you, Mr. Hughes. Our next question of the evening comes from Richard Repetto with Putnam Lovell Securities. Richard Repetto - Putnam Lovell Securities Hi, guys. Mitchell Caplan - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - CEO, Director Hey, Rich. Richard Repetto - Putnam Lovell Securities I'm going to try to keep it at two questions here, I think, but first on the guidance. You know, it's pretty much stayed the same and sounded pretty cautious but when you look at what's going on in the mortgage industry there, the MBAA is up by 30% originations, 96% of that is refi, 85% of it is in the next three quarters. So I guess -- plus you have the restructuring and at least some marketing decline this quarter. You know, how can we -- I'm just trying to balance out how you, you know, are looking at the guidance and, you know, with the uptick in mortgages, where are we offsetting it to keep just flat guns? Mitchell Caplan - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - CEO, Director Let me take a first pass at that, Richard, if I can, and then let me turn it over to Len. As you have seen, we have consistently delivered our numbers in accordance with street consensus estimates when many of our competitors have failed to do that. And I think it is exactly what you are referring to, which is the diversified model, that has allowed us to do that. So when we gave the initial guidance, my recollection was we said that transactions would stay flat last year at $88,000. You saw a decline this quarter of about 6%. We offset some of that clearly in connection with the performance that you are seeing at the mortgage company. So again to your point, I think we have more visibility than most as we give guidance because you look at the different components that make up our income. That being said, it's unclear exactly where transactions will go for any of us. Clearly, our goal is to ensure that we gain market share consistently. We've done it now for the third quarter in a row and will remain focused on that, but it doesn't guarantee that you won't see a decline in transaction and so as we look forward, you know, our hope would be that exactly what you are saying, each of the different components works together in the aggregate to offset. And one decline in revenue could be offset by an increase in the other as well as a decline in expenses. Also, the point that I just want to make really quickly with the restructuring charge is, we intend to finalize it in this quarter. We will begin the implementation over the next two quarters. It will probably be Q4 before you even begin to see any significant pickup, whatsoever, as a result of the benefit, and you should really begin to look forward to next year in terms of those cost savings of 7-8 cents. 9 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Earnings Conference Call Leonard Purkis - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - CFO Except if we look at the restructuring, we're really assessing and finalizing that plan to really maintain the profitable future of our model and align it with today's conditions. The benefits we quote of 7-8 cents are on an annualized basis and really position us going into 2004. So, again, I think what Mitch is explaining is that we gave the step-by-step assumptions we had in getting to our guidance for this year. Those parts are moving around and that's part of the beauty of our model is those parts can still move around, and we've still got a challenge to get to the 45-55 cents guidance, but we've got an opportunity to get there. Mitchell Caplan - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - CEO, Director And I think, Rich, what you really are getting to is, what happens if transactions remain flat or stronger and the mortgage market is better. And the answer is, clearly, we drop it to the bottom line and deliver in-excess earnings. That's clear. Richard Repetto - Putnam Lovell Securities Okay. I mean, clearly it looks like the mortgages are going to -- it's, the forecast is better than what it was in January. I guess that was one point. But anyway, on to the next question, I guess is -- I'm going to cheat here but it's got two parts. It's about looking at market share and, for example, your trades -- the number of trades looked on less your peers, the competitors. You know, sources, we're thinking about trading being down, say, 14-18%. So -- but when we look at the commission line, the brokerage commission line, it's down right in the middle of, you know, that range, down about 16%. So I guess my question is, you know, how do you look about, you know, is this incremental market share that we're taking the active trader segment? You know, how do you look about added -- you know, is it actually increasing the revenue line? We know trades are in there but what about revenues? A little bit on the banking, as well. If you look at this segment information, you know, you had banking revenues up 7%, but you had expenses up 10% from quarter to quarter. So I'm just trying to look at, you know, how -- well, I guess they are two separate questions but, you know, how would you address those? Mitchell Caplan - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - CEO, Director They are. Let me have Lou answer the first one with respect to brokerage, and then Arlen can answer the banking question. Lou unknownLou Klobuchar First of all, Rich, with respect to brokerage market share, we're certainly happy to see ourselves gaining on the transaction side of that business, and see ourselves outperforming there. Clearly our average commission per transaction is declining. That's very much what we intended. With our Power of Nine campaign, as you are well aware, we have tried to segment and go after a segment that still remains fairly stable in this environment, the active trader segment. We delivered a value proposition to them that included more aggressive pricing, along with speed and quality guarantees. So it's working there exactly the way we want it to. We intend to really continue that approach to drive increases in market share. Pricing will be one component of that, not the only component. You are probably also aware that we extended that Power of Nine campaign to options trading in the last quarter, and I think as Mitch reported in the script, we've seen options trading amongst active traders as a percentage of active trader total trades increasing about 12%. We intend to continue to be aggressive and grow that space. We want to be known as a place for options executions for active traders, and want to dominate that space. Those, of course, generally speaking generate higher commissions. So we hope to mitigate the effect of some of these price cuts by going after that type of product. Arlen, I think, do you want to speak about the banking? 10 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Arlen Gelbard - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - CBO, President E*TRADE Bank Yeah, just, Rich, on the banking side of things, you know, the first reason for the change really was all around the corporate allocations which, you know, were just starting to work through here as both Mitch and Len discussed. But also, you know, we are on the banking side in a, you know, in a ramp-up phase as we're looking at new lines of business that are helping to increase our recurring sources of revenue and interest income. So, for example, I mean, you know from following our story that we don't just jump into something new. So, while, for example, we have just started our credit card business, before we really go out with it in a major way, we have to build up the infrastructure to be sure that we can handle what we want to do and be sure that we can manage the risk appropriately. It's the same thing not only in credit cards but as we're up -- you know, as we are increasing on the [ordering side] and home equities. You know, in addition, it was the rolling in of Ganis, and that really had a substantial G&A increase for us. You know, and finally we increased our marketing spin and, you know, we were very pleased to see what the results were as it went quarter to quarter. Richard Repetto - Putnam Lovell Securities Okay. I can ask more off-line. I just wanted to thank you for the more deliberate pace at the beginning of the conference call as well. Mitchell Caplan - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - CEO, Director My pleasure. Thanks. Operator Thank you, Mr. Repetto. Our next question of the evening comes from Mike Vinciquerra with Raymond James. Michael Vinciquerra - Raymond James & Associates I'm like Rich. I've got multiples but I'll try to stick to two here. The first one, on the mortgage warehousing, I'm trying to get a feel possibly if you can share with us what the net interest income was on the warehousing. Obviously, if you are carrying a billion plus, say, per month in loans held for sale out of your retail operation, that will have some impact on the margin because of the steep yield curve right now. And the second question, I just want to get a feel for the -- actually I've lost my train of thought. Why don't you answer the first one. I'll come back on the second one. Thank you. Leonard Purkis - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - CFO You better come back fast because we don't divulge what you asked for in the first part of the question. So what was your second question, Mike? Michael Vinciquerra - Raymond James & Associates Okay. Second one is actually regarding Dempsey. We just listened to LaBranch call earlier. Can you just clarify for us similarities and differences between Dempsey's operation versus LaBranch on the on the NYSE? Obviously, you've got the captive order flow from your retail system, but give us an idea how they compare, because, obviously, Dempsey did have a challenging quarter much as we saw from some of the other specialists. Thank you. Mitchell Caplan - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - CEO, Director Let me -- I'm going to have Lou answer the question, but I think as a highlight because he -- it's easier for me to sort of tout the success of Dempsey before I turn it over to him, because it was his baby which we acquired. We have continued to be profitable in Dempsey. So when you look at lots 11 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call of the other competitors in the market space, they are singularly becoming unprofitable and notwithstanding that, Dempsey is still a bright and shining spot for us and remains profitable as one of our business lines in the brokerage. Notwithstanding, its profitability, it clearly has significant value, as you've pointed out to us is a result of internalization and the benefits that we've gotten there, but let me turn it over to Lou and let him walk you through it. Lou unknownLou Klobuchar I mean, from a structural standpoint, the biggest difference between any regional specialist or third market trading firm versus the New York Stock Exchange is that those market centers attract order flow on the basis of offering executions at the national best bidder offer. We surveil all market places and provide executions on the basis of the best bidder offer in any market center. Somewhat ironically, that makes us less able to quote/unquote "see something as captive order flow" because execution quality is what's paramount not only to E*TRADE but many of the other retail order sending firms, and there are 130 of them that send in to Dempsey and Company. So we fight for that order flow on the basis of execution quality and it is as true with the internal order flow as it is from other order sending firms. Having said all that, Dempsey and LaBranch have in common the fact that we've had three tough months. It's a very difficult market. Generally speaking, over a three-month period, you would see some uptick somewhere for a week or two or three within the period. We really didn't get much of that in this quarter. As Mitch said, the entity remains profitable. It's got a highly variable cost structure which ensures that even at these levels it will remain profitable but it's core to our business. In a tough market it's a defensive play for us. As you may also be aware, if you don't have an internalization mechanism, there are many markets that are beginning to charge to execute order flow. So we think we are well positioned to be defensive there. as well to protect the economics of that order flow for E*TRADE. That's really about the size of it. Michael Vinciquerra - Raymond James & Associates I appreciate that. Len, if I could come back for one second on the previous question. Could you at least let us know, did the NIM at the bank actually improve because of the warehouse money? I would assume that has to be a yes. Mitchell Caplan - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - CEO, Director It was -- it's niche and the answer is it has a deminimus impact when you look at it. But let me answer your question a different way, which is if you look at the -- which I think what you are really getting at -- margins in our mortgage business widened quarter to quarter. So in Q4, if you look at our pricing last year on average it was about 189 basis points in terms of margin. It widens in Q1 to 195 basis points. A part of that would really be shown in the income which is in the mortgage operations line, okay? So you saw a widening of margins. And as we've entered into Q2, they have remained relatively flat and consistent with what we've seen in Q1. Michael Vinciquerra - Raymond James & Associates I appreciate that. Thank you. Mitchell Caplan - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - CEO, Director Sure. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Sobhani with Smith Barney. 12 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Glen Manna - Banc of America Securities#Smith Barney Actually this is Glen Manna. I just have a quick question on the bank accounts. How many of those accounts came from the Amicus transfer because that closed early in March, right? Arlen Gelbard - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - CBO, President E*TRADE Bank Yes, it did. Amicus was about 6500 count. Glen Manna - Banc of America Securities#Smith Barney Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Judd Gorsun with Capital. Judd Gorsun - The Capital Hi, Judd Gorsun of The Capital. Great quarter, guys. Just on the charge, what percentage of this is -- what portion of this is cash versus noncash or is the whole charge a cash charge? Mitchell Caplan - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - CEO, Director Let me turn it over to Len. Leonard Purkis - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - CFO The added on -- up to $120 million, about $30 million of that we anticipate as being a cash charge. Not all of that will be up front. That will be spread out over time and with the anticipated savings that we're getting from that, that would be a payback within 12 months. Judd Gorsun - The Capital So $90 million is noncash? Leonard Purkis - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - CFO Correct. Judd Gorsun - The Capital And is any portion of that goodwill or is that something else in the balance sheet? 13 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Earnings Conference Call Leonard Purkis - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - CFO No, none of that is goodwill. Judd Gorsun - The Capital Gotcha. Thank you very much. Leonard Purkis - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - CFO You're welcome. Operator Thank you. And our final question of the evening comes from Greg McCosco with Lord Abbott. Greg McCosco - Lord Abbott Yes. Thank you. Could you talk about the interest rates, the spread -- on a pro forma basis, I believe it was 160 basis points at the end of last quarter? I assume then it went down? Arlen Gelbard - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - CBO, President E*TRADE Bank Our spread at the end of last quarter was 140 basis points. We then -- we acquired Ganis right at the end and we said at that point that we expected an increase of 20 basis points on a pro forma basis. We've gotten that from Ganis. But that being said, the same type of macro economic factors that drove our spread down in Q4 originally, you know, are still in play here. You know, to say we're still in the same kind of environment, that's leading to greater and greater mortgage volumes as interest rates stay low. So, you know, you really have a choice. Either you say that you are content with your spreads being where they are, at least initially or, you know, or you try to take other types of risk as one possibility. That's something that we've said over and over again that we're not willing to do. We're not willing to go down that credit spectrum. But the other thing that we are doing, is that we are constantly optimizing our balance sheet. We are looking for better mixes of assets, better types of assets to put on our balance sheet, and you'll see, for example, you know, if you see the movement, that we moved out of mortgage hold loans at MVS and into ABS and more consumer finance assets, you will see that that's why our spread didn't go down nearly as much this quarter as it otherwise could have. I mean, the other thing is that we are looking to add new asset classes, we're out there looking. We don't base our model on it, but it is something that we want to do. But we have, as those of you who follow our story know, that we have very strict guidelines as -- that we follow when we're looking at an acquisition, and if it doesn't meet our credit criteria and satisfy due diligence 100%, we just won't do it. So you know, I'll give up spread every day rather than putting our execution at risk. Greg McCosco - Lord Abbott I see that the automated tellers I think went up 3500 and also what was the break-even on the -- break-even on brokerage in terms of number of transactions? Arlen Gelbard - E*TRADE Group, Inc. - CBO, President E*TRADE Bank Well, just I'll just address that. On the ATM machines, that went up because we closed on our purchase from extra cash of a portfolio of 3500 135# machines. And that quite simply is how it went up. We closed that deal in the middle of February, and as to the brokerage, I'll turn that over to you. 14 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

CORPORATE PARTICIPANTS Lawrence Sala Anaren, Inc. - President & Chief Executive Officer Joseph Porcello Anaren, Inc. - Vice President, Finance CONFERENCE CALL PARTICIPANTS Earl Lum CIBC World Markets - Analyst Rayna Smith Needham & Company - Analyst J.D. Abuchar Pacific Edge Management - Analyst Greg Weaver Kern Capital - Analyst PRESENTATION Operator Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Anaren Third Quarter Earnings Release. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Larry Sala, President and Chief Executive Officer of Anaren, Inc. Please go ahead, sir. Lawrence Sala - Anaren, Inc. - President & Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for participating in the Anaren fiscal 2003 third quarter conference call. I'm again joined today by Joe Porcello, our Vice President of Finance. I'll provide a brief overview of the third quarter results ended March 31st 2003; after which, Joe will review the financial highlights. We'll then take your questions. The statements contained in this conference call, which are not historical information, are forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those discussed. You're encouraged to review Anaren's third quarter press release, Anaren's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30th 2002, and the Anaren's Form 10-Q for the third quarter ended March 31st 2003, and exhibits to those reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to learn more about the various risks and uncertainties facing Anaren's business and their potential impact on Anaren's net sales and earnings. Net sales for the third quarter were $19.2 million, down 8% sequentially from the second quarter fiscal 2003. The operating loss for the quarter was $1.5 million compared to operating income of $2,000 for the second quarter of fiscal 2003. The operating loss for the third quarter included a $296,000 restructuring charge for a workforce reduction and a fixed asset impairment charge of $681,000 at Anaren Europe in our Wireless Group. These actions were in response to the continued weak wireless infrastructure demand. The net loss for the third quarter was $958,000 or 4 cents per diluted share compared to net income of $475,000 or 2 cents per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal 2003. On a proforma basis, excluding the impact of these one-time charges, net income for the third quarter was approximately breakeven. Wireless Group net sales for the quarter were $11.9 million, down 10.7% sequentially from the second quarter. The wireless market demand remained very weak, and visibility remains poor. We continue to focus on developing proprietary products that offer higher value. During the quarter, we introduced new miniature surface model products under our Xinger brand, developed an active back-plane [ph] that incorporates high power microwave signal switching, and also established our first custom product design win in Asia for an Asian OEM customer. This design win is a direct result of our recent investment in an Asian-focused direct sales and engineering organization. The Wireless Group customer concentration for the quarter as a percentage of wireless group net sales was: Ericsson at 22%, Powerwave at 12%, Lucent at 10%, and Motorola at 5%. Our 802 product development activity also continued in the third quarter with the introduction of our Femto series balun product line. This product line is 75% smaller than the Pico product line that we introduced just nine months ago and expands our addressable market in Wireless LAN and other mobile wireless applications. The Femto series product line supports 802.11 (a), (b) and (g) applications. For the Space and Defense Group, net sales for the quarter were $7.3 million, down 3.5% sequentially from the second quarter of 2003. Space and Defense Group new orders for the quarter were $6.3 million and included follow-on orders for Defense satellite antenna distribution networks and airborne jamming subsystems. The Space and Defense backlog at March 31st 2003 was approximately $28.7 million. Based on the continued weak wireless market conditions and the recent financial performance of the company, we are taking further aggressive actions to reduce our operating expenses and to improve our financial performance. Specifically, we are anticipating a fourth quarter restructuring charge of approximately $1.2 million for further workforce reductions. Based on the reductions in 2 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call the third and the coming fourth quarter and other aggressive cost reduction activities, we're projecting a $6.5 million reduction in our annual operating expenses. We fully intend to continue our aggressive growth and diversification activities and believe that in spite of these recent cost reduction efforts, we're still well staff to execute on our strategic initiatives. Joe Porcello will now review the financial highlights. Joseph Porcello - Anaren, Inc. - Vice President, Finance Good afternoon. The financial highlights of the third quarter income statement and the balance sheet at March 31st 2003 are as follows. The gross profit margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2003 was 26.2%. This was a 50 basis point decrease from gross margins of 26.7% in the second quarter of fiscal 2003. Gross margins fell on the wireless products due to a decline in sales and rose slightly on space and defense products in Q3 due to a change in product mix resulting in higher level of commercial space programs in the third quarter shipments. Going forward, in the fourth quarter, in fiscal 2004, we expect to see some improvement in gross margins as a result of our current cost-cutting efforts. Investment in research and development was 9.3% of net sales in the third quarter of 2003 compared to 7.3% in the second quarter of fiscal 2003. Research and development expenditures have increased in both actual dollars and as a percent of revenue from the second quarter due to a decrease in sales levels in quarter three and the application of additional personnel to work on both new wireless LAN and wireless infrastructure component opportunities. The loss from operations was 7.8% of sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2003 compared to breakeven operating income in the second quarter. Operating margins decreased due to the restructuring charge and asset impairment charge reported in the third quarter as well as a small decline in third quarter gross margins and higher R&D levels. In early April, in conjunction with the reorganization of Aneron Europe, the company performed a FAS 144 evaluations and independent appraisal to determine if the fixed assets due for our subsidiary were subject to an impairment loss. This appraisal resulted in the identification of a FAS 144 impairment loss of $681,000, which was reported in the third quarter. The company is continuing to review all opportunities to reduce costs including additional fourth quarter personnel reductions. These reductions are expected to provide improvements in fiscal 2004 operating margins despite anticipated lower sales levels. The net loss was 5% of net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2003. This compares to net income of 2.3% of net sales for the second quarter. On a per-share basis, the diluted loss per share for the third quarter was 4 cents. This compares to income of 2 cents per diluted share in the second quarter. Cash, cash equivalents, and investments were approximately $128 million at March 31st 2003, up 3 million from June 30th 2002. We've continued to enjoy a positive cash flow from operations in the first nine months of fiscal 2003, despite the loss. Cash generated by operations was approximately $8.7 million in the first nine months of the fiscal year and came in part from a 3.1 million and 1.6 million reduction in inventory and accounts receivable, respectively. Accounts receivable were 11.5 million at March 31st 2003, down 1.6 million from June 30th. Net sales outstanding at the end of March were 54 days compared to 56 days at the end of June. We continue to expect day sales outstanding to fluctuate between 50 and 70 days, as we go forward, depending on sales levels, customer mix and business conditions. Inventories at March 31st 2003 were $17 million, down $3.1 million or 15.3% from $20.1 million at June 30 2002. Capital equipment additions in the third quarter of fiscal 2003 amounted to approximately $600,000. The additions were mainly for production equipment at our East Syracuse facility to support a new military satellite program. Accounts payable at March 31st 2003 were $3.9 million, down $1.1 million from June 30th, reflecting the decline in material purchases, which resulted in the current inventory reduction from the June quarter. During the first nine months of fiscal 2003, we purchased 271,900 treasury shares in the open market at an average cost of $8.13. As anticipated, we will continue to make open market purchase of shares for treasury under the current board authorization depending on market prices. Relative to Celeritek, the company's original investment in Celeritek common stock averaged approximately $8.47 a share and totaled $6.6 million. This investment had a market value at March 31st of approximately $5.9 million, a decline of $700,000. The company considers this to be a temporary decline in market value and has been recorded as a charge to other comprehensive income in the shareholders equity section of the balance sheet at March 31st. If at a future date this drop in market is determined to be other than temporary, then the decline in market value at that point in time, including the amount previously charged to equity, would be recognized as a loss in the current period income statement. Lawrence Sala - Anaren, Inc. - President & Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Joe. Given the weak wireless market demand and planned fourth quarter restructuring, we are projecting fourth quarter net sales of $18.5 million to $20 million and diluted earnings per share of 1-cent loss to a 4-cent loss. We'll now take questions. We would now like to open the line for questions. 3 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Joseph Porcello - Anaren, Inc. - Vice President, Finance Hey Earl. Earl Lum - CIBC World Markets - Analyst Just a quick question. With regard to the cost cutting and the 1.2 million charge you're going to take in Q4 how could we Joe, are we going to be able to recognize those savings as we look into fiscal '04? Joseph Porcello - Anaren, Inc. - Vice President, Finance We should see it in the first quarter. Earl Lum - CIBC World Markets - Analyst Okay. So we would then be able to just take off 6.5 or whatever we're modeling that for the full year? You're expecting that the full amount to be recognized in fiscal '04? Joseph Porcello - Anaren, Inc. - Vice President, Finance Yes. Earl Lum - CIBC World Markets - Analyst Okay. And then as we look towards the guidance that you just gave -- just kind of the upside of the sling factor primarily coming from the wireless side and are we assuming that the defense and space is going to be relatively flat for the quarter or are we seeing some growth out of that as well? 4 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Lawrence Sala - Anaren, Inc. - President & Chief Executive Officer No, neither growth will come out of the wireless side of the business. We're actually anticipating that we may be down a bit sequentially in our space and defense business. Earl Lum - CIBC World Markets - Analyst Okay. And Larry, obviously, you got to come out with a bunch of new products including the low noise amplifier product can you give us sense as to what the feedback is that you're getting from your customers for all these new products that you're hoping that you're going revenue from at some point in the near term? Lawrence Sala - Anaren, Inc. - President & Chief Executive Officer Our feedback remains positive and our sample rates have remained high. I -- we believe though our design in rates have been very slow and mostly attributed Earl, to the fact that we don't see a lot of new platform design activity on going. So, the activity that we see today is more focused on cost reductions of the existing platform. And for the products, the component products that we offer anyone by itself will probably not be enough cost savings to drive an amplifier redesign or a radio redesign but if one were to happen for other reasons, we certainly think our product will be incorporated at that time. Earl Lum - CIBC World Markets - Analyst Okay. So more of a new completely new design built then you'd probably get more components into the boxes? Lawrence Sala - Anaren, Inc. - President & Chief Executive Officer Correct. We are seeing the custom design activity, we see for cost reduction purposes, is typically is enough to warrant our customer to go ahead with redesign. So, we expect that any tick up in volume will come more for custom products design and for cost reduction purposed then from any other products that we offer. Earl Lum - CIBC World Markets - Analyst Okay. It sounds like you are gaining some traction over in Asia can you give us an update on how that is coming along? Lawrence Sala - Anaren, Inc. - President & Chief Executive Officer Yes, well about it was almost a year ago now we first established our facility in China and it was about four to five months after that that we started to locate a sales and engineering capability in Asia. We've seen a lot of our component strength and our revenue and wireless, I think being a little stronger than some of our peers. We think largely due to our maintaining and gaining share in Asia. It's just in the last quarter we finally started to see a higher level of custom product design activity in Asia. And as you know, our custom product typically has average sales prices between a 100 and $400 or $500 a piece whereas our component products are typically $1 to $5 or $10 type of items. So, the revenue opportunity is typically much larger for our custom product. So, we see interest and have prototyping activity ongoing in custom products, in South Korea, in China, as well as, in Japan for both amplifier manufacturers and base station OEM type applications. 5 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Earl Lum - CIBC World Markets - Analyst Okay. And I guess at this point with the new products, I guess are we looking for much longer design cycle to be able to - for you to be able to see revenues from some of these new products. Is it typically now searching out beyond the couple of quarters and maybe even after a year from that that before we may see some revenues coming from these new products? Lawrence Sala - Anaren, Inc. - President & Chief Executive Officer More typical is 9 to 12 months. Some of these things are reasonable amount of way down the path. So we would expect early in the second half of our fiscal '04 to start seeing revenue contribution from this activity. Earl Lum - CIBC World Markets - Analyst Okay. Great. Thank you, Larry. Lawrence Sala - Anaren, Inc. - President & Chief Executive Officer Sure Operator And we'll take our next question from Rayna Smith with Needham and Company. Rayna Smith - Needham & Company - Analyst Hi, good afternoon. Earl Lum - CIBC World Markets - Analyst How are you? Hi. Rayna Smith - Needham & Company - Analyst Alright. I was hoping you could comment on how much impact you're expecting to see on gross margins from the previous cost cuts in this coming quarter, in the June quarter? Joseph Porcello - Anaren, Inc. - Vice President, Finance There'll be some but not a whole lot, because we've got a significant amount of cost cutting still going on in this quarter. Rayna Smith - Needham & Company - Analyst Okay. 6 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Joseph Porcello - Anaren, Inc. - Vice President, Finance So I expect to see some improvement, maybe 2 to 3%. Rayna Smith - Needham & Company - Analyst Okay. Great. And then of that total that you're expecting to see in 2004, how much of that is from the additional cuts that you're expecting in the fourth quarter and how much is from previous action? Joseph Porcello - Anaren, Inc. - Vice President, Finance Only about a million is the result of the cuts in the third quarter, about five and a half is work force reductions and cost reductions that we expect to achieve this quarter. Rayna Smith - Needham & Company - Analyst Okay. And going back to the new product discussion, I just wasn't sure in that last answer, if the new product that you're talking about, is that the 802.11 product that might be? Joseph Porcello - Anaren, Inc. - Vice President, Finance No we're talking -- the question was relative to wireless infrastructure OEMs based in Asia. Rayna Smith - Needham & Company - Analyst Okay. Joseph Porcello - Anaren, Inc. - Vice President, Finance We've got some design activity there. Rayna Smith - Needham & Company - Analyst When are you expecting to see volume production levels for the 802.11 product? Joseph Porcello - Anaren, Inc. - Vice President, Finance We're expecting to see production volumes starting to ramp up in the first half of our fiscal '04, so over the course of the second half of this calendar year. Rayna Smith - Needham & Company - Analyst Okay. And I know that some of your peers, they've had some recent earnings disappointments. Could you comment on, if there are any areas where you're seeing relative strengths or if you had any stronger than expected areas during the quarter? 7 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Lawrence Sala - Anaren, Inc. - President & Chief Executive Officer The quarter pretty much played out as planned. We've seen sporadic strength in custom products for Asian applications. We've seen build outs in China over the last three quarters, at times, to be surprisingly strong, with very little predictability. We have not seen a lot of demand in Europe or for the US market. Rayna Smith - Needham & Company - Analyst Okay. Lawrence Sala - Anaren, Inc. - President & Chief Executive Officer So for us, it's been more custom products for applications in Asia. Rayna Smith - Needham & Company - Analyst Okay. Great. And then space and defense how much visibility do you have looking forward and can you give us any kind of an outlook as far as orders that might be coming up or anything like that? Lawrence Sala - Anaren, Inc. - President & Chief Executive Officer Well, we basically have pretty much consistently run this business. I'm trying to maintain somewhere between 14 and 18 months of backlog. Backlog is now down $28 to $29 million range, we don't see that increasing around for the rest of this fiscal year. So, we would expect to go in say next year, with the expectation of seeing a decline in revenue on our Space and Defense business based on our current backlog situation. So, Rayna Smith - Needham & Company - Analyst So, year-over-year decline for the full year. Lawrence Sala - Anaren, Inc. - President & Chief Executive Officer Yes. Rayna Smith - Needham & Company - Analyst Okay. Thank you very much. Lawrence Sala - Anaren, Inc. - President & Chief Executive Officer Sure. Operator And we'll like to remind everyone, if you do have a question press the "*" key, followed by the digit "1" on your touch tone telephone. We'll go next to J.D.

Earnings Conference Call J.D. Abuchar - Pacific Edge Management - Analyst Hi. Thanks for taking my call. Two quick questions, one: would be when your charges and work force reductions are fully implemented? What do you think the break even point goes to, both, on a cash flow basis or EPF basis? Joseph Porcello - Anaren, Inc. - Vice President, Finance On an EPF basis, I say, somewhere in the neighborhood of 60 million. J.D. Abuchar - Pacific Edge Management - Analyst 60 million, annually? Joseph Porcello - Anaren, Inc. - Vice President, Finance Yes. J.D. Abuchar - Pacific Edge Management - Analyst Great. And then, if you could just talk a little bit more about the balance, just rough range of ASPs and I assume its one or two per access point? Lawrence Sala - Anaren, Inc. - President & Chief Executive Officer Yes. We're also getting involved in the client's side as well, with this new 3 mm by 3 mm product that we have. Your price points, depending on complexity of the product, probably range anywhere from say 15 to 30 cents per device. What we do in some cases, we incorporate other functionality with the balance, which increases our ASPs. J.D. Abuchar - Pacific Edge Management - Analyst And then, even on the client, would it be like one or would it be multiple? Lawrence Sala - Anaren, Inc. - President & Chief Executive Officer Has the opportunity to be multiple, so typically not more than two. J.D. Abuchar - Pacific Edge Management - Analyst That's right. Great. Thank you Larry. Lawrence Sala - Anaren, Inc. - President & Chief Executive Officer Sure. 9 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Operator Your next question comes from Greg Weaver with Kern Capital. Greg Weaver - Kern Capital - Analyst Hi. Just following up, if you had anymore reference design wins, on the 802.11 side? Lawrence Sala - Anaren, Inc. - President & Chief Executive Officer Yes, we have. We do not announce to customers yet, until we start to see people ordering in higher quantity and reference designs turning into more potential revenue. But, we're seeing, multiple reference designs in one. Greg Weaver - Kern Capital - Analyst Okay. And just a clarification on the Asian revenue, Larry you mentioned that, that was helping you out currently, but you said that you weren't going to see revenue till the second half of fiscal '04? Lawrence Sala - Anaren, Inc. - President & Chief Executive Officer Well, right now, we're seeing revenue out of Asia for mainly products that we designed in with either US or European OEMs that have moved their manufacturing to Asia to service growth and demand that they have out of Asia. It's only, while I was talking to -- previously was new design activity with actual Asian OEMs that we've gained in the last quarter, that we would expect to start ramping in the second half of the calendar year. Greg Weaver - Kern Capital - Analyst Calendar year? Lawrence Sala - Anaren, Inc. - President & Chief Executive Officer Does that make sense? Greg Weaver - Kern Capital - Analyst Right. But the only confusion there now is that, the thing in the press release about getting a wind with an Asian OEM. Lawrence Sala - Anaren, Inc. - President & Chief Executive Officer Right. That's something that we expect to start having a contribution in, over the next quarter or two. Greg Weaver - Kern Capital - Analyst Okay. And Joe, what's the total authorization on the buyback? 10 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Joseph Porcello - Anaren, Inc. - Vice President, Finance Two million shares. Greg Weaver - Kern Capital - Analyst Okay. You got pretty of head room there. And on the ferrite production what percent is outsourced at this point or moved over to China? Lawrence Sala - Anaren, Inc. - President & Chief Executive Officer Right now I believe about 50% and we'd expect to be at 90% by the end of this quarter of everything we shift, coming out of our China facility. Greg Weaver - Kern Capital - Analyst Okay. And how about adoption of your strip line circulator? Lawrence Sala - Anaren, Inc. - President & Chief Executive Officer We are actually starting to see our first true OEMs designed, moving in to some sort of preliminary production here. It's been fairly slow up take initially, we believed largely because of a lack of a competitive alternative that kept our customers from designing it in. But our new mini circulator offers such significant cost saving that we're seeing customers start to design that product in. Greg Weaver - Kern Capital - Analyst And no body else has one? Lawrence Sala - Anaren, Inc. - President & Chief Executive Officer And no body else has one right now. Greg Weaver - Kern Capital - Analyst Okay. And back to the 802.11, do you have any opportunity there for some of these phase [indiscernible] antenna guys for that? Lawrence Sala - Anaren, Inc. - President & Chief Executive Officer We haven't seen a lot of interest there yet. Greg Weaver - Kern Capital - Analyst Okay. And where are the balance manufactured, is that in Syracuse? Lawrence Sala - Anaren, Inc. - President & Chief Executive Officer Yes the majority of manufacturing is done in Syracuse. 11 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

At this time, we have a follow-up question from Earl Lum with CIBC World Markets. Earl Lum - CIBC World Markets - Analyst Yes. Larry, back on to the 802.11. Can you give us an idea or some sense of the level of design wins that you currently have, that we may expect at some points, you know that's going to eventually get into production? Lawrence Sala - Anaren, Inc. - President & Chief Executive Officer Not actually, certainly what you're looking for in terms of level. Earl Lum - CIBC World Markets - Analyst I guess in terms of -- number of sockets wins that you might be able to give us some color on in terms of the quantity of socket wins that you have already, excluding the reference designs that you're on. Or were they primarily associated with the reference design? Lawrence Sala - Anaren, Inc. - President & Chief Executive Officer They're primarily associated with reference designs and I venture to say Earl it's something between 6 and 12 reference designs that we could absolutely confirm and probably another 6 to 10 that are in some pending stage. Earl Lum - CIBC World Markets - Analyst Okay. And then if you look at this point, is there any competition for that particular socket other than your product there? Or what is the competitive part that could be there to share that socket with you? 12 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Lawrence Sala - Anaren, Inc. - President & Chief Executive Officer Our competition is a ceramic-based discrete balance [ph] type of product similar term in functionality we think, we have superior performance. Our footprint is unique. So, we believe that when we're designed in we're in sole source position. We don't see any footprint compatible product being offered and we think our performance is appreciably different to the point that it would be difficult to build source to slot [ph] with us. Earl Lum - CIBC World Markets - Analyst Is the ceramic balance that you're talking about more based upon like the wireline [ph] ferrite solution, say like, some like a mini circuits, that type of products? Lawrence Sala - Anaren, Inc. - President & Chief Executive Officer Not typically, it's more typically a prototype of structure in a multiplayer ceramic type of package from a Morata [ph] or some Asian ceramics. Earl Lum - CIBC World Markets - Analyst Got it. Okay. That makes a sense. All right great thank you. Lawrence Sala - Anaren, Inc. - President & Chief Executive Officer Yes. Operator And we have another follow up from Greg Weaver with Kern Capital. Greg Weaver - Kern Capital - Analyst I'm at five M write down. Is that some mode of a reflection of your inability to get traction there or is it more of an accounting thing? Lawrence Sala - Anaren, Inc. - President & Chief Executive Officer No, it's direct reflection of our inability to get revenue rate up to the point that we can support the assets in that facility. Greg Weaver - Kern Capital - Analyst So you would train some people and were out trying to sell product for, I don't know I guess something six months or so now so that not going any where? Lawrence Sala - Anaren, Inc. - President & Chief Executive Officer Yes. At least not at the rate that we bought warranty [ph] the level of people on the facility and that our accounts were comfortable. We will generate positive cash flow in the facility soon enough to support asset rate there? 13 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Again, now the reference design that they were talking about -- these are all chip manufacturers, right. Lawrence Sala - Anaren, Inc. - President & Chief Executive Officer Right. Greg Weaver - Kern Capital - Analyst So there's a like a couple dozen chip manufacturers. Lawrence Sala - Anaren, Inc. - President & Chief Executive Officer Correct. Greg Weaver - Kern Capital - Analyst Have we had a lock with some other newer guys that have recently popped under the scene that are US-based?

I do have on the call with me Rolf van Kaldekerken, who is President of our European Operations, and Charlie Brown, who is the CFO, both of whom are in France on the conference call. Im here in Delray Beach. As you know, this morning we announced the acquisition of Guilbert, one of Europes premier contract stationers. Ill go through this  give you a little bit about Guilbert, a little bit about the transaction, its strategic rationale, some issues on synergy, and some comments, and then Ill open the call up for questions. First, a little bit about Guilbert for those of you who are not familiar. This is clearly one of Europes leading contract stationers, premier brand names and a presence in nine European countries. Its one of the largest contract stationers in Europe. It has a leading position in the UK and France, and 2 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Conference Call on Guilberts`s Acquisition a number two position in Germany. As I said, there are nine different countries, 18 warehouses, 32 Call Centers, and 5,700 employees. And as Ive said, this is really a premier company by any way you want to measure premier. A little bit about the transaction, most of which was in the press release. Were going to acquire  its our intent to acquire 100 percent of the stock of Guilbert from its parent, PPR. The purchase price was 815 million Euros, plus a contingent payment: a 550 million Euro payment at closing date  and I might add this is a debt-free company were purchasing  a 265 million Euro payment on June 30th, or the closing date, whichever is later, and theres an additional 40 million Euro price if Office Depot stock hits $20 for any five consecutive days in 18 months following the closing. We will use our available cash and revolving credit to fund the transaction. And as outlined in the earnings release, the acquisition will be accretive to EPS in its first full year of operation, 2004, and we believe that accretion to be conservatively five to 10 percent. A little bit about the strategic rationale. First, as many of you know, weve been in Europe since 1990 with a highly successful business model and this offers us a unique opportunity to strengthen our already-strong European market position. It doubles the size of our existing European business. It provides critical mass to our newly established European contract business. It fits our multi-brand, multi-channel strategy here in North America, and we acquired two great names: Guilbert, as the contract stationer, and a private branding name called Nice Day, which is recognized as Europes  or one of Europes leading brands with a significant amount of Guilberts business done in this brand name. Theyre both highly regarded. It gives us a meaningful competitive position in the large customer segment in the UK, France and Germany, and it compliments our existing catalogue operations in nine additional countries. Europe, as many of you know, is a large fragmented market that does provide outstanding opportunities for growth. Large customers throughout Europe are demanding single-source providers and this acquisition gives us the opportunity to service across the continent within Europe and across oceans, which more large customers are demanding. The four top players in the European market account for less than three percent of the total market. This is fragmented, as I said. This is an opportunity to grow. And clearly this acquisition gives us untapped e-commerce opportunity. There isnt any question that were a leader in e-commerce, have been from the very beginning, a leader not only in the public dot.com e-commerce sites, but in our business sites for our customers. And we feel very strongly that we can leverage this technology and expertise to our new European large customers. It further diversifies Office Depots business. It fits into an existing business platform. It is complimentary versus redundant. We have started up contract businesses in Europe, going now back to almost two years, and our primary focus has been on small and medium-sized accounts. Guilberts business is predominantly in the large customer segment, so it fits in a complimentary way, not in a redundant way. And the result is this is about growing two businesses faster. It somewhat mitigates our dependence upon U.S. retail results, although retail will always be, continues to be an important part of Office Depot. Last year our International Division accounted for 14 percent of our revenues. On a two-goal pro forma basis, looking at Guilberts side, we would have had  it would have been  23 percent of our business would have been internationally. By the way, Guilbert last year did in EBITDA 82 million Euros in EBITDA on about 1.4 billion Euros, and so the transaction is for 10 times EBITDA. But it does change the complexion of our Company. It offers significant synergy opportunities in purchasing, in supply chain, in G&A costs, in the avoidance of startup costs to enter new segments, and in tax rate savings as well. Let me speak one moment to synergies. I said earlier that this transaction in the first full year of operation, 2004, will be accretive to earnings five to 10 percent and we believe that to be a very conservative number. I said earlier that the purchasing synergies  just to give you some examples, were anticipating purchasing synergies in the range of 1.5 to two percent. We believe that is realistic; we believe its conservative. On supply chain, we are planning on synergies of the two to three percent range. Again, we believe those to be conservative numbers. One of Guilberts core competencies is the ability to deliver customer orders on their own fleets. We do not have that capability in Europe today. We think theyre very good at it; its a Best Practice. We intend to learn from it and exercise it across the Company. G&A savings, again, weve anticipated conservative amounts, five to eight percent G&A savings on the combined companies. 3 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Conference Call on Guilberts`s Acquisition Again, we believe these synergies are conservative; theyre attainable, and well work hard to get them as quickly as we can get them. And in 2003, were not quite certain how quickly they will come and thats why our forecast for 2003 is either neutral or slightly dilutive, depending on how quickly we can achieve these synergies. This acquisition, together with our existing operations, results in a very strong competitive position in the UK, France/Germany, and the Netherlands, along with the rest of Continental Europe. It gives us a contract business in three countries  Spain, Portugal and Belgium  that we would have started up on our own. And it gives us presence in those countries by acquiring Guilbert. Back to the synergy side for a minute, we can rationalize it to you. We can look at Best Practices and contracts. We can leverage our scale. We can harmonize our operating procedures and our management of G&A. And we can [indiscernible] our value-proposition customers. All of this should give you confidence of our ability to deliver this transaction and integrate it successfully within Office Depot. Certainly it has its risks, but were coming off a highly experienced business model in Europe, having been there, as I said earlier, since 1990. Let me summarize for a minute and then well open up the call for questions. First, you might ask the question, Why would we consider acquiring an international company who has got a headquarters in France in the current geopolitical environment? We have carefully studied and considered the current world events and the potential customer impact and have concluded, after long conversations and discussions, that this opportunity is strategic and that any impact of the short-term geopolitical things are in fact short term, not long term. We think large corporations are rational when they choose suppliers and theyre rational in the combination of value-added services, products, and they buy, in essence, from relationships. And in the case of Guilbert, these relationships are over many, many, many years. The second question Im sure you will ask us is, Will this cause us to lose management focus and attention on our North American retail business? Our North American retail business and improve our top line represents our number-one priority and that has not and will not change. We have been in Europe with an experienced management team since 1990. We have highly experienced and proven leadership with significant depth and embedded strength throughout Europe. Guilbert adds more to that already proven business model. We already have successful operations in the nine countries in which Guilbert does business. Theyll just add more scale and size and strength to our organization. Clearly, the integration will require some U.S. involvement, predominantly in IT and Finance. In those two areas they do not distract from North America retail growth. Merchandising, marketing and operations for Office Depot has always been European-based, and will continue to be European-based in this transaction. From a merchandising perspective, one of the synergies I didnt talk about was global purchasing. Clearly, thats where we put our efforts on both sides of the globe and we think the acquisition of Guilbert will already add scale and size to our industry-leading position as the largest importer of global office products across the United States and Europe and this just adds to it. In summary, before I turn the call over to you for questions, I would point out that: 1) we have a highly conservative management team and approach to our business. Thats reflected in our balance sheet; thats reflected in our financial reporting; its reflected in our communications to our stakeholders, shareholders, employees, and customers; and, its all based on building confidence and trust, something that I set out to do as the CEO of the Company almost three years ago. We have carefully considered, planned, analyzed, discussed and come to an agreement on the things we then choose to flawlessly execute. Sometimes that means Office Depot takes longer to act than some of you would like. But we do so with a lot of discernment. We have been actively engaged in discussions with PPR for well over a year. We have done significant amounts of due diligence. We understand this business well. We understand its position in Europe. We understand the strength. We have our organization to integrate it. We understand where the risks are, and we have a management team, both in Europe and in North America, that have had extended experience in integrating businesses. 4 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Conference Call on Guilberts`s Acquisition We are calculated risk takers, but we are not risky. This deal is financially sound. Its financed by our existing cash, paid in installments to allow us to take the cash from the business we acquire and help pay for it at a later date. Its a debt-free transaction. Its five to 10 percent conservatively accretive in the first full year of consolidation and in every year thereafter. The synergies are conservative; they are reasonable; and, we believe theyre highly achievable. And frankly, we think the synergy case as outlined is the worst case, both in 2003 and beyond. This acquisition finally is highly strategic. It achieves our objective, our long-stated objective, of being the undisputed European industry leader. It positions us as either number one or number two in every country where we operate in Europe. That means we have scale; that means we have leverage; that means we have brand recognition; that means we have customer recognition. And I might add, by the way, we still have very, very good competitors, but we believe it positions us well. It adds size, scale, and critical mass to our existing highly profitable European business. We did not have to buy this business to achieve profitability in Europe. We already have it and weve got 13 years of doing it. This just adds to what we already do. It is complimentary to our small and medium-sized business startup obviously, as I said earlier. And it gives us entry to three important new contract markets  Spain, Belgium, Portugal  where we already have our presence. And this clearly fits our successful model of multi-channel, multi-brand business all across the globe. We are enormously excited about the opportunity to buy Guilbert. This has been a company that has a long rich history in Europe. And as I said earlier, its one of the premier names. We are excited about the people weve met in the due diligence process. We believe that they can add enormous strength to Office Depot. We believe they have some of the very best sales reps in all of the world. And they clearly have some customer relationships theyve had for long, long periods of time, which we believe we can enhance. We believe the combination of these two businesses will give our customers more value, more choices, more products, more services, over more countries, all serving from a single company in a very challenging and difficult economic environment. And this is but one of many steps we are taking to maintain our position as the worlds largest seller of office products. With that, now Id like to turn the call over to the operator for any questions you might have. Thanks for your time this morning to listen to us. Thanks for your interest in Office Depot. And with that, well turn the call over to the operator. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Operator Thank you. At this time well begin our question-and-answer session. If you have a question, simply press star, one on your telephone touchpad. If at any time you wish to withdraw your question, you may do so by pressing star, two. Again, thats star, one if you have a question. Our first question is from Dan Binder with Buckingham Research Group. Dan Binder - Buckingham Research Group - Analyst Good morning. A question on your assumptions going forward with regards to the organic growth rate of this business. What should we be modeling for? And then it looks like it had about a 4.5 percent operating margin. What do you think the opportunities are in terms of getting that up over the next two or three years in terms of magnitude? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Dan, I think the opportunity to project that operating margin over the next couple of years is significant. I dont think thats necessarily true in 2003 as we acquire and begin to integrate. But clearly, if you look at the synergies that Ive outlined, I think there are significant opportunities. Weve 5 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Conference Call on Guilberts`s Acquisition proven around the world that we can operate businesses like this in certainly a six to seven percent operating margin range. And I would hope over time we can do that. They have 32 Call Centers; they have 18 warehouses. I think that over time we can rationalize some of those. One of our findings in their warehouses is that where they  they have some very good warehouses, by the way. We think they lack some of the sophistication we have in our North American and European warehouses. What that means is, with some Cap ex we believe we can drive efficiency and productivity. We found some outstanding people and systems. We think we can leverage some of their systems across our existing business in Europe. That adds value. I talked earlier about private label. They are really good at this. They have a very large percentage of their business in the private label called Nice Day. I think that gives us leverage. Thats a name well probably use worldwide. It has that kind of appeal. I think it has some purchasing synergy to it. All of that means is that I believe we can leverage up this operating margin. Weve not done a lot of modeling out of this, if you will, past two or three years. I mean, frankly, our focus now is to complete the transaction. Weve got to get the European approval to do so. Well begin the planning process in detail. I said earlier, weve had a year of this. Weve already had a huge opportunity and time to plan the integration. Whats most important now is that we integrate this. But this is about growth. We think that we can accelerate the growth of both their business and our own. And so this is a story about how we grow this business, frankly, more than it is about how we saved money by acquiring it. So, clearly, the margins can go up in this business. We have a proven history of doing it. So, I think theres opportunity and I think youll see over time that again the opportunities weve outlined I believe are conservative and I believe thats the best way to approach synergies today given the environment were in. Dan Binder - Buckingham Research Group - Analyst Do you think a mid-single-digit organic growth rate for modeling purposes seems reasonable at this point? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Yes, I think that mid to high single-digit is reasonable for the modeling for the combination of the two businesses. Dan Binder - Buckingham Research Group - Analyst OK. And then Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO My hesitation is the current geopolitical environment and the impact that might have in the short term. But yes, I think its reasonable that should model out in the single to high single-digit growth. Dan Binder - Buckingham Research Group - Analyst You mentioned that you had plans to integrate for some time, or have been able to lay out some plans for integration. Can you detail in terms of timing, costs, and what the most complicated part of the integration is? 6 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Conference Call on Guilberts`s Acquisition Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO I wont detail as to the costs. I think once weve acquired the business and weve closed on it and we have to file the proper statements, whether well get much more clear and articulate about some costs. Weve got some good ranges now, but theyre merely ranges. While this has probably been one of the industrys worst [indiscernible], the fact is an awful lot of our people didnt know that we were looking at this. And so weve had some [indiscernible]. This has been truly this industry forever and that the highest risk is the integration of people and cultures, and then followed by systems. And those are highly related. And I think we know on day one some things on systems that we think well do them. And one of the things Im enormously confident about is our ability to understand people and cultures. Were in three countries in Europe in the last four or five months. Weve been identified as one of the very best employers to work for. I think that says a lot about our culture and we welcome Guilbert into the organization. And frankly, were going to work hard to make sure the best of both organizations end up in the best position. And thats a key part of our culture. But the risk is  the risk really is people and cultures. I dont think theres a lot of risk on the financial side. On the synergy side, the purchasing risk is probably negligible. Its not at zero. Thats the one you get quicker and faster. I think that even Staples would say that thats come quicker than they thought in their European Staples. And frankly, were a lot larger than they are. Dan Binder - Buckingham Research Group - Analyst And then on the timing, once you have possession of the company? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Pardon? Dan Binder - Buckingham Research Group - Analyst Just in terms of the timing of the total integration. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Well, I think  were going to take as long as two years. I mean, were going to do part of this slowly. I mean, first of all, this is about growth. Its not about cutting their operations and cutting their people and closing their warehouses. Frankly, this is about how we accelerate growth around our organization. And we think there is some limited opportunity in terms of some of the consolidation of authority, but we dont see that a lot. I think the longest-term conversion has taken place. They have converted recently to SAP. We admire what theyve done. Its basically a single system in eight countries. In nine countries [indiscernible] conversion to SAP and that was a significant conversion. But its going to take a couple of years. Were not going to rush it though. And thats partly why Ive got the synergy numbers conservative because I dont want to rush it. I want to  well do it to get value; well do it to make sense. I dont want to disrupt customers. I dont want to lose the loyalty of their people that have just become part of our company. And well go at it steadily but surely. And weve got some plans. So, I dont know how to answer you in any different way than that right now, Dan. Dan Binder - Buckingham Research Group - Analyst No, thats great, thanks. Best of luck. 7 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Conference Call on Guilberts`s Acquisition Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs - Analyst Thanks a lot and good morning. A couple of questions, if I may. First of all, Bruce, if you could just clarify the synergy levels that you laid out for purchasing, supply chain, and G&A, are those the levels that you would expect to achieve by 2004 or on a full run-rate basis for 2004, or are those longer synergies? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO I think that purchasing will come earlier wed expect to achieve that level. For the period we own the business in 2003, although it takes a month or two to get those started up, so I think theyd come in 2004, but youre at the full run rate in 2004. I think some of the other ones, we achieved most of those as rates, if I use the word rate, in 2004, and then in the out years, 2005 and 2006, some of those decelerate. Ill give you an example. One of the things that Guilbert does extremely well is they have a better way to deliver merchandise to their customers than we do. Its predominantly through an owned fleet of [indiscernible] and drivers. We use third-party carriers. Thats going to take us a year-and-a-half, two years to integrate. You just dont put this kind of volume into their fleet. So thats  you know you get some of that in 2004, probably none of it in 2003, and you get more in 2005. So I think frankly wed get the ramp rate for the most part in 2004, with some continued improvement in the out years. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs - Analyst OK. My second question, you had been investing in contract stationer startup operations in Europe. Can you refresh our memory on how much you had budgeted for that, you know, pre-acquisition for 2003, and whether your numbers take into account an unwinding of some of that bottoms-up investment in that business? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Im not going to ever refresh your memory because I didnt breakout 2003. But  I mean we basically said last year we incurred about $50 million of startup costs in Europe to run this contract business. Again, remember its predominantly in the small to medium-size business segment, not the large. Weve had our losses in 2003 directionally. Itll probably be a little less than that because weve had some of the bigger ramp-ups. This clearly will cause us not to have to invest at this same rate. For example, in 2003 we had some plans to enter this large customer segment by hiring reps and managers and well not have to do that anymore. I would guess probably as early on, I think the Cap ex for this business  I think the total Cap ex for the two companies combined will be similar to the Cap ex we had for [indiscernible] alone. So I think we can rationalize the same there. So this will  I think this will cause some slowing down of our own investment in [indiscernible]. We did plan on entering Spain and Belgium and Portugal with a contract sales force in the out years. We wont have to do that. Were early in our entry into the Netherlands. This gives us a significant position. This has, if you will, savings to offer to the people by having to  by avoiding the startup costs, which were predominantly hiring costs. One of the early things well do is to try and harmonize our sales reps on the kind of accounts they call on, the territory of the accounts, the management of the compensation systems, the territories, Best Practices. So well focus on that, but this is about growing our business. We think when were done, both companies can grow faster than they would have been able to grow alone. 8 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Conference Call on Guilberts`s Acquisition Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs - Analyst Thank you. And one final question. You obviously have both an abundance of capital, given your cash balance, and a lot of ways to use that capital. Can you discuss the return profile on the investment that you chose to make, I guess on ROI terms, and maybe compare it to some of the other things you might have thought about? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Well, I think the thing that all of you and a significant amount of our shareholders think about when it comes to usage of cash, I think that all boils down to should we buy back stock. And so I think that how does this compare to buying back stock, well, I mean, if you just did those things independently, you would probably argue that we could take the same amount of money and buy the same amount of stock back and it might be more accretive. This is accretive. It exceeds our cost of capital. Its cash-on-cash positive in the first year of the business. So we look at it as a way to say, Look, I said all along that we would use our cash to build shareholder value and to grow our business. And we think its a good use of cash. We still generate, frankly, more cash than we use. It does not preclude us from considering stock buybacks in the future, which we will consider. We just happen to think its a unique opportunity at the right time to buy a very premier company at what we see today as a reasonable multiple given the depth and the breadth of this company. And its all about driving shareholder returns and this will increase shareholder return. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs - Analyst Great! Thank you so much. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Colin McGranahan with Sanford Bernstein. Colin McGranahan - Sanford Bernstein - Analyst Good morning Bruce and good morning Rolf, if youre on from over in Europe. A couple of questions to follow up here on a couple of other questions that have been asked. First, youre saying it is accretive in the first year. What are you currently using as your cost of capital for that calculation? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Somewhere between nine and 10, although our own hurdle rate is in the teens. But if you do  if you do an actual cost of the capital, nine, 9.5, 10 percent, pick a number on some assumptions youd want to make about cost of capital, on an internal hurdle rate, we use European and this clears our hurdle rate. Colin McGranahan - Sanford Bernstein - Analyst I got you. Secondly, you said the Cap ex for the combined business you think will be similar. I think the last number you put out there was about $80 million in Cap ex for Europe in 03. Is that correct? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Yes, I think thats correct. As I said earlier, while their warehouses are highly productive and efficient and appear to have high quality, we think theres opportunity to put some capital back into those warehouses, particularly the larger ones. We dont know what that is yet. Again, this is not something in the process you can get really deep on. But we have a little bit more work there, but we think that early on, as I said, once we close 9 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Conference Call on Guilberts`s Acquisition on the transaction and we have a chance to do a more in-depth look, I think well get more clarity. But I think directionally $70$80 million in Cap ex in Europe this year is still kind of what we expect. Colin McGranahan - Sanford Bernstein - Analyst Thanks. And then would you care to talk any more about how much the purchasing or supply chain synergies might be in dollar terms, or as a percentage of sales? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Well, I talked about those. I mean, I talked about purchasing is one-and-a-half to two percent of our costs. Colin McGranahan - Sanford Bernstein - Analyst Costs? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Yes, because thats how youve got to look at it, our cost of sales, not our costs. I said I think thats reasonable. Ill give you  on delivery we think that, just to give you a range, we can take four to six percent of our total delivery costs when you combine the two companies together. I think thats pretty reasonable. When you look at G&A costs, were saying five to eight percent of our total G&A costs. That seems pretty reasonable. And so those percentages that I look at, not as a percentage of sales, but as a percentage of the costs of each of those. And I think that weve gone down, weve got a long list of items, if you will, that we need to confirm once weve owned the business, but were confident that we can achieve at least the level of synergies that Ive outlined. And its that level of synergies that gives us five to 10 percent accretion in 2004. And so I think thats a fairly confident and conservative number as well. Colin McGranahan - Sanford Bernstein - Analyst One final question. Just in terms of leadership of the European business and the combined entity, have you figured out whats that going to be? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Absolutely! It falls under Rolf van Kaldekerken, who is on the call. Hes been President of Europe for the last couple of years. I said in my summary this is a company in Europe thats got enormous depth and skills in our leadership. Thats evident by our results. You dont get the kind of results we get internationally if you dont have a great leadership. Guilbert adds to it. So this reports will take the head of Guilbert and have him immediately, once the transaction is closed, report directly to Rolf. We have a very skilled individual whose name is [Rob Vale]. Rob came to us a number of years ago from [indiscernible] where hes had enormous experience in integrating the [indiscernible] acquisition. He clearly knows how to compete against [indiscernible]. Hes been the one that has predominantly led our startup for our contract businesses. All of us that know Rob think very, very highly of him. This is a man thats seen in Europe thats long in depth. I cant explain it any other way than that. And well compliment that with some very good leadership here in North America. But this will be run from Europe by Europeans who understand language and cultures and frankly, when a customer buys from us or from Guilbert, theyre buying from a local company. Theyre buying from a French company or a German company or a Belgium company. Theyre not buying from an American company, even though American owned. Thats been the strength of our leadership in Europe, understanding cultures, understanding languages. 10 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Conference Call on Guilberts`s Acquisition Colin McGranahan - Sanford Bernstein - Analyst Thats good. Best of luck! Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Danielle Fox with J.P. Morgan. Michael Keara - J.P. Morgan - Analyst Hi, Im Michael Keara sitting in for Danielle Fox today. You guys, I might be mistaken, but I dont think there is  I dont think you guys gave guidance for 04 and youre talking about five to 10 percent accretive in 2004. So I guess Im trying to look at what EPS number that were trying to get to there. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO We would say thats over consensus  consensus 2003 earnings. Michael Keara - J.P. Morgan - Analyst I beg your pardon! Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Over consensus 2003 earnings. Michael Keara - J.P. Morgan - Analyst What is consensus 2003 earnings? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO I dont know. You can go  its consensus earnings for 2003. Michael Keara - J.P. Morgan - Analyst So, Im just adding five percent to the consensus Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Five to 10 percent over consensus 2003 earnings. 11 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Conference Call on Guilberts`s Acquisition Michael Keara - J.P. Morgan - Analyst OK, alright. I guess  what else did I have here? You talked about some of the synergies and maybe its a little bit early, but do you anticipate any charges in connection with the integration process going forward? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO The synergy numbers Ive given you are net of the integration costs. Theyll fall into two categories. Some of those costs well be able to capitalize. Some of those costs well have to take directly to the bottom line. This is an area we need a lot more work and specificity on because again, in the due diligence process you get some idea of this, but you dont get deep enough to know specifically what your costs are. The numbers Ive spoken to you do all have in them our own estimates to date of integration costs, which predominantly take place in 2003 and 2004. Some linger into 2005, but the predominant of them are in 2003 and 2004. One of the large costs we have in 2004. We just dont know exactly what it is in size and how much is capitalized and how much is expense is we have to convert their UK organization to the latest version of SAP. That is not a small conversion. Thats got both hardware costs, software costs, and integration costs with it. We know we have to do it; we know that PPR or Guilbert had planned to do it. We know what they thought that cost would be. We need to verify those and understand if weve got a different way to look at it. So once we know that, we can then articulate both to ourselves and you what those might be. But the synergy Ive talked about are net of the costs that we think well have to absorb and take to our bottom line as a result of accounting principles. Michael Keara - J.P. Morgan - Analyst OK. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Baker with Deutsche Banc. Mike Baker - Deutsche Banc - Analyst Hi, thanks. Most of the smart people in front of me asked my questions, but I will ask two more here. One, in terms of the organic growth rate, mid to high single digits, is that an acceleration from what the business had done in the past year or two? Can you tell us how the business has grown in the past year or two? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO It is not an acceleration from Office Depots organic growth rate. It is an acceleration of Guilberts growth rate. Guilbert 2003 over 2002 was flattish, up a little bit. Frankly, we believe that Guilbert in 2002 ran the business for profitability and was still in the process of absorbing their investments in the conversion to SAP. So we think that 2002 was a year in which Guilbert focused on bottom line, a mindset of bottom line, improving profitability, coming off a major SAP conversion. We believe theres enormous opportunities to put back into the Guilbert organization the mindset of growth. And so its a slower growth rate than the organic one at Office Depot; its an accelerated growth rate from what Guilbert has had the last year. Mike Baker - Deutsche Banc - Analyst OK. And so, I guess, reading from that, is that acceleration to lets say mid to high single digits growth going forward, is that part of the accretion that youve talked about? Is that assumed in that five to 10 percent accretion? 12 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Conference Call on Guilberts`s Acquisition Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO No, its not. Let me put it this way. If you look at 2004 and look at consensus earnings, were thinking this acquisition, along with those growth rates, will add to earnings five to 10 percent, so in that regard, the answer is yes. Mike Baker - Deutsche Banc - Analyst OK. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO But Ive said all along, I believe these synergies are achievable. I believe in most cases they are in fact worst-case scenario. Mike Baker - Deutsche Banc - Analyst And then, finally, on that five to 10 percent accretion, Im a little confused, is that on the 03 consensus number, which is $1.06, or the 04 consensus number, which is $1.17? I would have thought it was on that $1.17 consensus number. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Im talking about 2004 earnings off of 2003 consensus number. Well grow 2004 five to 10 percent over 2003. Mike Baker - Deutsche Banc - Analyst OK. Got you. Thanks. Operator Thank you. At this time Id like to turn the call back over to Mr. Nelson. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO OK. Thanks very much for your time and for your questions. I close by saying that this acquisition is enormously strategic and comes to a company that knows how to do business outside the United States. We have the organization to do it; we have the leadership to do it; we have the skills and experience to do it. And it gives us, frankly, a position in Europe that will be difficult for others to achieve and follow, not impossible, but difficult. How does it count? It counts for customers; it counts for suppliers. It compliments our business model in Europe. Its about how we grow this company faster and return shareholder value more quickly. Weve tried, and Ive tried specifically in my almost three-year tenure as CEO, to build a base of business on a solid foundation, and show our balance sheet of solid financial reporting, communications for our shareholders and stockholders and our employees who you can trust and have confidence in. And Im enormously confident about our ability to absorb this and make it an integral important valuable part of Office Depot. I couldnt be more proud to have Guilbert as part of this company. There just are few companies with the name they have in Europe and with the strategic position they give us. We have the balance sheet to do it. There are always risks to integration. To say there arent any would just not be so. We certainly are in an uncertain economic time caused by geopolitical events. I dont pretend to be an economist. I dont know what impact 13 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Conference Call on Guilberts`s Acquisition the war is going to have on the economy. Frankly, I dont know next day, let alone next month. I just know when we look at this in the long term, well look back and say this was enormously strategic. They did it well. It did what we said all along about growing our business. It does not take away from our North American retail. Well talk next week about our first-quarter performance. More importantly, I will give you specific insight into some things I said we were going to do, that I said I would tell you when were done and Ill give you some of that next week on the retail call. But this is a company that is not losing sight here in North America. We intend to grow our business as well. Thanks for your confidence; thanks for the time youve taken to listen to our call. I wish you all well. Certainly, in a broader aspect, I wish you peace on earth. God bless all of you. Thanks very much.

CORPORATE PARTICIPANTS Eileen Dunn VP, Investor Relations and Public Relations - Office Depot Bruce Nelson Chairman and CEO - Office Depot Charles Brown EVP and CFO - Office Depot CONFERENCE CALL PARTICIPANTS Matthew Fassler Goldman Sachs & Company - Analyst Daniel Binder Buckingham Research Group - Analyst Colin McGranahan Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc. - Analyst Michael Baker Deutsche Bank - Analyst David Katz Matrix - Analyst Bill Patser Analyst - Analyst PRESENTATION Operator Good morning. We would like to welcome you to Office Depot's First Quarter, 2003 Earnings Conference Call. All lines will be in listen-only mode for today's presentation. Afterwards, instructions will be given in order to ask a question. As the request of Office Depot, today's conference is being recorded. I would like to introduce Ms. Eileen Dunn, Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations, who will make a few opening comments. Ms. Dunn, you may begin. Eileen Dunn - VP, Investor Relations and Public Relations - Office Depot Thank you. Before beginning today's conference call, I'd like to remind you that certain of the statements made on this call are forward-looking under the Privacy Security's Litigation Reformat. Except for historical financial and business performance information, comments made on this call should be considered forward-looking. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed on this call due to risks and uncertainties both foreseen and unforeseen. Certain of those risks and uncertainties are described in detail in our report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 13th, 2003 and in our other filings with the SEC from time to time. In portions of this call, our CEO Bruce Nelson, will refer to results of our first quarter which do not reflect the adoption of EITF 02-16 and therefore are non-GAAP numbers. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP numbers to GAAP results is attached to our press release issued earlier today and on our Web site. Now I'd like to introduce Office Depot's CEO and Chairman, Bruce Nelson. Bruce Nelson - Chairman and CEO - Office Depot Thanks, Eileen, and good morning to all of you who joined us on the call this morning. Myself together with my key management team is here in Del Ray Beach, Florida. And we'll take you through the challenging first quarter. 2 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call First, as Eileen mentioned, with the adoption of this new accounting guidance called EITF 02-16, some of our results on GAAP make it very difficult for comparison to prior periods. So, I'll talk about our first quarter on a pro forma, non-GAAP basis so as to give you more insight in how the business performed in the first quarter irrespective of the required changes we had to make under 02-16. As you all know, we're committed to reporting our results in conformity with GAAP, but at least for this quarter, it's important to understand how our results compare to prior periods. And the best way to do that, I think, is to present them in a basis that ignores for the moment the effects of EITF 02-16. As Eileen said, you can find a reconciliation of the information to GAAP on our last two pages of our earnings release. Some of you've heard me say many times there's a Chinese proverb -- some say blessing, some say curse -- I happen to thing it's a blessing: May you live in interesting times. And certainly, from a broad perspective, we certainly do. From the geopolitical environment, which has its impact on business, to the economic issues we have here in North America and in Europe. And in some respects on a small scale to weather related issues that we all experienced in the first quarter of this year. It was at best a challenging business environment for Office Depot. Added to that is the fact that Office Depot, as you know, is on a calendar year basis for reporting our results, when most other retailers are on a fiscal year. That comes into play more than ever this quarter when we're one of the first retailers to have to report the mandatory adoption of EITF 02-16 in our results. It means it's difficult, at best, to understand and explain. Only a few retailers so far have reported under this basis; so there needs to be a broader base of understanding of the impact of this accounting rule. We have attached supplemental schedules to our earnings release. And at the end of the call I'll ask Charlie to give you a summary of the impact at Office Depot. And certainly it causes confusion when trying to compare operating results in this quarter versus last year's. Combined with that, on a non-GAAP basis, our 30 cents reported earnings per share fell below the consensus of 32 cents. Our North American retail comps were negative 6.7 percent and came in at the very high end of expectations. And as you know from previous calls, a one percent change in our North American retail comps basically translates into a penny a share. And on that basis, if you summarize the quarter before I get into some detail, you would conclude that missing North American comps in the range we thought we would be in, in the minus four minus five range, is the entire two cent variance in the quarter on EPS. It's much more complex than that and now what I'll do is to take a little bit of time to take you through the first quarter. I'm going to spend a little less time on the first quarter than I normally do. First, if you got an earnings release, it's 14 pages long. It is loaded with insight, detail, information, and analysis that far exceeds most of what anybody provides investors and it's designed to give you clear insight into the business. I'll summarize the current quarter. I'll spend more time than I normally do talking about the actions, some of which we've taken others which we have plans, that we are confident will change our revenue growth line in retail in North America and will continue to allow us to accelerate our growth in our delivery businesses here in North America and our exciting international businesses. So let's go to the first quarter results briefly and as I said my comments will be somewhat brief. At the end of the call, certainly, you're free to ask any questions that you might have. On a consolidated sales basis, worldwide sales grew one percent. I might point out that all of our results now also exclude Australia in which the sale of that business was completed early in the first quarter. 3 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call First quarter sales went to three point one billion, our sales increase in BSG, e-commerce, and our international businesses, including some positive impact from European exchange rate translations, more than offset the six point seven decline in North American comps and negative sales growth in our domestic catalog businesses and in Japan. As a result, worldwide comparable sales were down two point six for the quarter. Worldwide e-commerce sales did grow 23 percent to almost $600 million and we are on track to achieve more than two point five billion continuing to lead both the industry and other industries in this category. In the BSG, balances here in North America, our overall growth was three percent. The contract portion of that was better at five. It was influenced by negative growth in Office Depot's catalog business but partially helped by growth in Vikings catalog domestic business, the first growth we've seen there in some quarters. International grew 23 percent in U.S. dollars, four percent of local currencies. We had strong performances in Ireland, U.K., Netherlands, Italy, and Belgium. We did have softness in Germany and France and significant declines in revenue in Japan. On an operating basis, as I said before, we adopted the new accounting standard EITF and so I'm now going to comment before those changes. Before the net impacts of EITF, this means these are non-GAAP, Pro Forma basis; our consolidated gross margins were down 20 basis points from last year, essentially flat. There's mixes in those changes, but essentially flat at 20 basis points. Our consolidated operating selling expenses were up 20 percent over last year, again essentially in the flat range. And our consolidated operating profit was down 40 basis points over last year, but that did result on a non-GAAP basis of operating profit decreasing by 12 percent, predominantly as a result of the negative sales growth in North American retail stores. Our operating profit was offset by our strong results in international, which I'll talk later about, was helped by favorable currency benefits. Our G&A costs in the quarter were negatively impacted by currency translation. A number of new MIS initiatives, increases beyond plan in our benefits and insurance costs, and about a penny of share related this quarter to our ongoing integration between our Viking and Office Depot Catalog businesses -- now names our Business Direct Division. On an EPS basis, excluding the effects of EITF 02-16, pro forma, non-GAAP-diluted EPS would have been 30 cents per share in the quarter, compared to 32 cents, as reported in the first quarter of last year. Some of the highlights of our first quarter -- and I'll talk much more specifically about retail, both when I discuss retail results and at the end of the call -- but we have rolled out Ink people to more than 500 stores by the end of this week. That's a roll-out that virtually all stores could be completed by early next month. This is not a small task. This Ink Depot roll-out takes between 250 to 350 hours per store to do. It's a major effort in our retail stores. Few retailers have been able to pull this off in a year, let alone in a couple of months from the time we started till the time we get done. Our global e-commerce sales, as I said earlier, increased 23 percent, domestically, 21, and international, 65 percent. We did launch a new Spanish-language Web site to a growing two million Hispanic-owned businesses in the United States. We are the first retailer in the U.S. to accomplish this. It will help drive revenues -- not only in e-commerce -- but we are confident, based on our sheer presence in a number of the very large Hispanic markets of the U.S. with stores, that it will also drive North American retail sales. We announced the entry of retail into Spain. We have now two stores open. We'll open three more this quarter, on track to open six for the year. That comes in a country where we already have an existing infrastructure. We already have a Viking Catalog business. We're the first major retailer to have a superstore of office supplies in Madrid. While we've only been open a few weeks, the results we've seen to date are encouraging. We did, as I said, complete the disposition of our Australian subsidiary, and our results now reflect those of discontinued operations. And in Europe, we were ranked one of the best places to work in Germany, Austria and the U.K. We think that's a remarkable achievement and fits the culture we're trying to create, both in Europe and here in North America. And, of course, we did announce our intentions to acquire Gilbert . I'll spend more time on that towards the end of the call. 4 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call North American retail -- as I said earlier, first quarter sales were down six, while comps were down 6.7, impacted by continued weakness in both furniture and technology sales. Core office supplies were essentially flat for the quarter. Furniture was down five percent in comps, versus seven percent in the fourth quarter, so some small improvement. Technology got worse in the quarter; down 20 percent, versus 10 percent in quarter four. More than half of our negative comps in North American retail stores are directly attributable to technology and furniture declines. Both categories we will address later this year in significant new initiatives I'll talk some about later. We've had some significant issues with our CTO's that's computer Configure To Order, caused by a supplier in not meeting shipment dates. Software was slightly down. Our average ticket was down about 3 percent, comparable transactions were down somewhat less than that. Conversion was up, we've been measuring conversion in our stores, so when we get a customer, are they buying something, we've made a major effort in that regard and conversion is up in our retail stores, trending up, and we believe this is an opportunity to even grow our revenue faster and better than the past. Our customer service indexes were all up. Complaints were down 45 percent. We did open 4 new stores, and one relocated. At the end of the quarter, there's 871 stores here in the U.S. and Canada. On the North American operating profit side, our operating profit margin declined 50 basis points. Gross margins were down 40. This is a little bit of a mix change as ink and toner starts to grow more rapidly, and it is. It has a slightly lower margin mix than Co-office supplies. There's some other products mix changes, and there is also, we've undertaken some increased promotional activity, highly targeted and focused to predominantly existing and high profile target customers, and that had some negative impact on margins, but the signs that it drives revenue are encouraging. Our total North American retail operating expenses declined 14 million dollars in absolute dollars, as a result of tight and controls in a very difficult sales environment. Operating costs increased 10 basis points, as a result of the loss fixed cost leverage in the declining sales. Included in our store operating costs this quarter, are about 250-300 hours per store for the rollout of Ink people. We had 220 stores at the end of the first quarter with this new format. We have 500 plus at the end of this week. And by May, we'll have all 870. By the time we complete that rollout, it will have cost us in labor costs, something a little more than a penny a share, but the net result on our revenue, on our traffic, on our transactions, and our baskets, are all very positive. As a result of all those activities, our net result in the operating income in our North American retail business declined 12 percent quarter over quarter. Our business services group, total sales for this group, increased 3 percent for the first quarter to 1 billion. The contract portion of this business, that's where we have sales reps assigned to accounts, had mid-single digit growth, 5 percent, reflecting some share gain on national accounts. Most of our markets in the western region have and are recovering from negative growth a year ago. Parts of our business in the east and in the southwest, suffered from severe weather during the first part of the quarter, but did recover. Our contract average order size continues to improve, that's an emphases we've had. We think that's a sign of growing health in that segment. Our business direct division, that's our North American [Inaudible] in businesses, continues in total to have negative sales trends, but Viking's Catalogue sales grew this quarter for the first time in some time, as we focused new initiatives in Viking to grow our business. And, as I said earlier, our domestic e-commerce business to be 21 percent. On the operating profit side, our gross profits declined 180 basis points from last year. This is the result of 2 primary things. One, there's a higher mix of lower gross margin large accounts. Large accounts have lower gross margin percentages. There have been some small pressure on paper margins in the first quarter. And the slower growth of our high margin catalogue businesses means this business when you aggregate it reports gross profit down 180 basis points. Our operating and selling expenses were essentially flat compared to last year in dollars, but that was an 80 basis point decline in costs. That's virtually all attributable to a continuing decline in our warehouse operating costs. This has been a remarkable two and a half year consistent story. Our costs get better. Our quality continues to go up. Our quality metrics continue to exceed expectations. 5 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call And that cost allows us in the long-term to be more competitive and be more aggressive because we've taken enormous costs out of our North American warehouses in the last two and a half years. And as I said, virtually all of the quality measurements in this business remain above expectations. On the international side, sales grew four percent in local currencies, 23 percent in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency translation benefited sales in the quarter by $76.8 million. Our contract sales -- our startup contract operations in Europe grew 118 percent. Our e-commerce grew 45. Retail comps in France were negative seven in local currency. We opened one new store in Europe and that was in Spain. Our France office -- Depot Retail and Catalogue -- grew 13 in local currency, but our France catalogue business as well as our German catalogue business were soft in the quarter. Japan's end sales growth was down 18 percent in local currencies. And the net result is in local we grew four, in U.S. dollars 23. On an operating profits side our gross profit was down slightly 20 basis points, virtually all mix related. Operating and selling expenses were down 30 basis points in spite of our continued investments in these countries and channels all in Europe. Operating income was up 10 basis points. And Japan achieved a breakeven for the first time ever in spite of a double-digit negative sales growth in local currency. We are making and have made substantial progress in Japan. While we're still losing money, it's at about half the rate a year ago. Last year was half the rate of the year previously and we're seeing some very encouraging signs in our BSC business in Japan. And we have a number of stores now profitable at the store level in Japan in spite of an enormously difficult economy. Our operating income in this segment grew 24 percent in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency translation benefited operating profit by 10.6 million in the quarter. And as a net result, operating income grew six percent in local currencies. A couple of financial highlights: we remain having a very, very strong cash position. Our first quarter cash balance was almost $980 million. Our cap ex for the quarter was 38.5 million. Our free cash flow was 57 million for the quarter. Before I talk about the future, I'm going to ask Charlie Brown for a brief summary of the impact of EITF 02-16 and the results of the quarter. And hopefully it will give you a little understanding of what all this means. Charlie. Charles Brown - EVP and CFO - Office Depot Thanks, Bruce. The first thing I'd like to do is give a little background to EITF 02-16. As most of you know, funds that we receive from vendors historically are classified either as purchasing rebates or as cooperative advertising support. Rebates were accounted for through reduction of product costs while co-op payments partially offset advertising expenses. Because rebates are a component of inventory cost, they are recognized as income when the product is sold, rather than when it's approved. That's an important distinction. The FASB, recognizing the potential for companies to manage earnings within a given period, through their categorization of vendor payments, now requires that all such payments are classified as a reduction of product cost. The limited exception is where companies can demonstrate that a vendor's payment offset specific advertising expenses. That's vendor-by-vendor test. This EITF was issued in December of '02 and became effective for us in the first quarter. Now, as for the impact on Office Depot; we've included schedules B and E in our earnings release to show the financial statement impact of adopting EITF 02-16. For just a quick summary, we recorded a cumulative effect of this accounting change as of the beginning of our first quartet, 2003.

Earnings Conference Call a result, net earnings were reduced by almost $26 million or eight cents per share because payments that previously offset advertising expenses, were effectively capitalized into our cost of inventory. During the quarter, net earnings were increased by three cents per share. As our normal business cycle reduced our inventory levels and a portion of the eight cents that was previously capitalized is now released to income. Assuming the amounts of inventory and vendor payments remain relatively constant, this accounting change will have no impact on operating earnings for the full year. There will, however, be small impacts on a quarterly basis as our inventory increases and decreases in conjunction with our normal business cycle. So hopefully you'll find the schedules B in particular with reconciled B, EPS impact and schedule E, which talks about the segment reporting will be helpful and of course Eileen and I are available after the call to help folks who need a little more clarity. That's it, Bruce. Bruce Nelson - Chairman and CEO - Office Depot Thanks, Charlie. Now I'm going to focus on a minute on what we're going to do to grow our business in North America. While I remain somewhat pessimistic about the overall economic condition, you should know I remain enormously optimistic about Office Depot's ability to grow both our revenue, our income, and earnings per share. We certainly have difficult times, but I - as I said in the first quarter, I'm sorry at the end of the year last year, we had identified five specific retail initiatives and I know a number of you were frustrated I didn't articulate those. I'm going to give you a little more articulation of some of those today because they're far enough along to understand the results and or they're far enough along to take advantage of being first to do these things competitively. First and foremost I talk about ink and toner. Why is this important? It's the largest category of supplies we sell in our store. Two, we've put in an average 600 square foot. These are stores in stores. They staff with a register. They have a kiosk. They have an ink finder. You can find the ink you need in terms of using the Internet. You can find it with a piece of paper. There's someone there to help you. You can take a shopping cart in there and buy it and see it and touch it and feel it. It has changed and is increasing. The traffic in our stores, the constant ink and other related products and we are excited about what this means. While other competitors have focused on this category, no one has given it the space we have. No one has staffed it with an individual person to give help. No one has done what we done and what we've virtually done with this initiative by the end of April or in the first week of May and that's remarkable when you think about [Inaudible] 67 stores. It's not just a re-merge. It's a store in a store. It's at the front of the store, and it's exciting. We have two more initiatives we will complete in the second quarter of this year. One is a writing instrument transformation. Why is this important? It's our fifth largest category in our stores. It is rich in market basket value and composition. It's one of the few departments in office supply retail stores that's expandable because customers like and have many, many choices. But the end of the second quarter, we will have added eight linear feet to virtually all of our stores in North America. We'll have added 580 new writing instrument SKUs, and we are confident we will have the best and the market-leading assortment of writing instruments, from low-value, low-cost to high-value, high-perceived-cost of writing instruments. We think it will help grow our business in North American retail. We will also complete, by the end of the second quarter, a significant re-merchandise of our binders. You say, "well, binders -- why is that important?" First of all, every one of our competitors and ourselves currently have binders merchandised by size and capacity. At Office Depot, we call it a "sea of binders." When you walk down an aisle, you see a sea of spines, and you don't know exactly what you want to do. We will provide, by the end of June in virtually all of our stores, a unique shopping experience that differentiates Office Depot from competitors. It is another significant investment in store hours. And remember, these have to be done during normal business times or after business hours, and some have disruptions 7 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call to your business. But when we get done, we'll have a [Inaudible] that segments binders by usage and occasion, as opposed to size. We'll be divided into presentation, storage and organization. We'll have new store signage, new door signage, new floor graphics, new aisle signage and new channel strips, which we think will make it easier for customers to buy the binder that best fits their needs. We think we can become a destination for customers' needs in binders, and we are confident it will drive incremental revenue. And it, too, will be done by the end of the second quarter. In the second half of the year, we will make significant changes in Furniture, Copy and Print, and in Technology. I will not articulate at this time what those changes are. That's predominantly for competitive reasons. But needless to say, if you take the time to go look at binders, writing instruments, and ink and toner at Office Depot, it could give you some insight to some of the significant changes we'll make in Furniture, Copy and Print and Technology. Late in this quarter, we will open an entirely new store format that we've called "Millenium." This store will be unlike any other office products superstore. During the second half of the year, we plan to remodel 25 to 30 of these stores in the new format, and assuming it meets our pro forma expectations, we could potentially remodel in 2004 hundreds of existing Office Depot stores. Our initial customer research on this new format is incredibly and extremely positive. It significantly changes the customers' perception of the customer experience, and after all, that's what it's about. We are on track to open 40 new stores in 2003, targeting 70-80 in 2004. Of the 10 new stores we plan on opening in this quarter, 6 of those are less than 10,000 square feet. That means we have identified a store size and format that can fit an existing Office Depot markets where we have density, or we can grow our presence, grow our share in markets in which we already have a significant presence. In the third quarter, we'll open about another 10 stores. These will average about 13,000 feet. What this means is, the stores formats are smaller, we can put them more places, they're break-even point is lower, we have enough of these models today that we're confident they work. It will also give us the ability to even further penetrate market areas where we already have significant density and market share. For example, in the next 18 months, we will increase the number of Office Depot stores in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach County, by almost 50 percent. We have similar plans for other important existing Office Depot markets. This will let us grow our presence even greater in markets where we have a significant position. In our BSG businesses, here in North America, we are continued to [Inaudible] resources in the large customer segment to take advantage of our cost structure, our capabilities across channels and brands, and our improvements in our North American warehouses. Our goal is to gain market share. Our new business direct division, which includes our North American catalogue businesses, are organized under one leader for the first time. The Viking brand and the Office Depot brand are the one leader. One organization, one infrastructure, will provide synergies, will provide cross-channel marketing opportunities, will make us better at prospecting, and using the leverage and the power of both brands. We expect that business will accelerate in growth in the second half of the year. And as I said, we are not through with our progress on North American warehouse costs. This has been a remarkable story, and continues into the first quarter, and will continue that throughout this year. On the international side, this has always been, [Inaudible] years, the market we said we had the most opportunity to grow old. Our retail expansion in Spain, as an example, our continued growth in multi-channel, multi-brand business models pays out. Take a look at the operating profits in our international business. We've been there since 1990, we know how to run businesses in multi-culture, multi- rainbow and multi-countries. We have a proven business model, and we have an experienced and in-depth management team. We are accelerating growth in our new Viking catalogue countries of Switzerland, Spain and Portugal. Our BSG startup businesses, which have focused predominantly today on small and medium size accounts in Europe, are achieving substantial growth rates, and we are making great progress in Japan. As you know, we announced, in the first quarter, that we intend to acquire Guilbert, one of Europe's leading contract stationaries. We have filed the necessary paperwork with the DU, and we are hopeful that we'll receive early approval of this transaction. We are confident that we can complete this transaction, and once we receive DU approval, we plan on closing this transaction with days after that approval. We articulated the reasons why we wanted to buy this business when we made the announced position, but the [Inaudible] announcement, but they're all focused on strategic growth and our ability to leverage complimentary businesses. We said at the time that we thought these businesses could be incremental to EPS five to 10 cents per share in 2004. We still believe that to be true. We said then, we'll say now that we believe those are conservative numbers. 8 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Once we close this business and understand it even in more depth, we will provide you much more specificity as to how and when we'll achieve synergies. But we believe this will be tremendously accretive for Office Depot in anyway you look at accretive: EPS, return on investment, return on net assets and clearly, market position and market share in Europe. Numbers of you have expressed a concern that Guilbert will cause us to lose focus here in North America. That's simply not true. We've been in Europe, as I said, for 10 years. We know how to do business there. We've got a great management team. Our marketing merchandising operation teams here in North America do not share responsibility with their European counterparts. Therefore, they'd lose no focus on running and integrating our Guilbert acquisition. North American retail remains our highest priority. I've tried to give you some insight as to why we believe -- based on what we've seen to date -- that our North American retail comps have bottomed. It's up from this point, albeit we're still in a challenging business environment clearly into the second quarter. And some of these initiatives, while not complete in the quarter -- we're in today the second quarter -- will give us benefit in the third and fourth quarters. Based on that, our outlook for earnings growth in the second quarter of this year is to be at about the same rate of shortfall that we were in the first quarter from last year's results. We also believe, however, that in the second half of the year our earnings will accelerate in the 10 to 15 percent year over year basis in the second half of this year. We believe the initiatives that we've undertaken, the impact of those initiatives predominately in our North American retail business, will accelerate our EPS growth in the second half of this year. So, with that what I'd like to do is now summarize by saying, certainly it was and remains a difficult business environment. But those of at Office Depot remain incredibly confident about our ability to grow our business, to grow return on net assets, to use our cash and resources wisely to invest and to grow our businesses. We've been committed to that since my joining Office Depot as the CEO two and a half years ago. And we stay committed to it. So, with that we'll turn the call over to you for questions. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Operator Thank you. At this time we are ready to begin the question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one. You will be announced prior to asking your question. If you would like to withdraw your question, please press star two. Once again, to ask a question please press star one. One moment please. Our first question comes from Matthew Fassler of Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Company - Analyst Thanks a lot and good morning. Bruce Nelson - Chairman and CEO - Office Depot Good morning, Matt. 9 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Company - Analyst A couple of questions. The first one I'd like to ask relates to inventory. I'm not sure whether EITF 02-16 impacted your inventory numbers in anyway, but it does appear that inventory was up a bit, probably in excess of sales. So, if you could give us a sense as to what issues are driving inventory or drove inventory in the first quarter and how you see that evolving over the course of the year? Bruce Nelson - Chairman and CEO - Office Depot Charlie, do you want to address that? Charles Brown - EVP and CFO - Office Depot Yes, Matt. Good morning. The inventory was impacted by the adoption of 02-16. Essentially what happens mechanically is the monies that we use to offset advertising with are now capitalized into inventory. And so it becomes part of the - of the inventory. They would actually be - they would actually be reducing inventory levels, inventory costs because again, they're an offset of that. Bruce Nelson - Chairman and CEO - Office Depot The other thing that I would say is that we have increased, intentionally increased inventory in our retail stores in two very - two areas. One is part of our marketing program for ink and toner is a guarantee of an in stock position. That's a fast turn item, those are double-digit inventory turns SKUs. We have increased our inventory. That's significant because this is a very large category. Second of all, we have also increased the inventory in a items in our retail stores. We just have an obsession about never being out of stock. And we have tested and found that by footing additional inventory, predominantly in A items, we have less out in the past and so part of that is intentional. I have no concerns at Office Depot about the quality of our inventories, about the age of our inventory, or about the fact that it did go up slightly in the first quarter. I have zero concerns of that regard. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Company - Analyst Got you. And my second question relates to EITF for quarters going forward. You said in you release, I guess, that you'll restate quarters as they are reported, but for projection purposes, can you give us a sense? Obviously EITF generally would help you, I guess, in the first quarter. If you look at the second, each of the second, third, and fourth quarters when does it help you, when does it typically hurt you? Bruce Nelson - Chairman and CEO - Office Depot Well, the amount, Matt, of the change is going to be less than a penny a share. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Company - Analyst Right, and then after that. 10 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Bruce Nelson - Chairman and CEO - Office Depot You're correct that it actually hurts us a little bit in the second, helps a little bit in the third, and then hurts us a little bit in the fourth. But again, all these movements are actually very, very small. That's one of the reasons we chose to adopt this standard on a cumulative affect was to try to pull it out so that when we roll into next year, the numbers will be comparable. But we will provide the same kind of guidance schedules B and E as we have this quarter. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Company - Analyst And my final question relates to the international business. I guess in local currency, the growth rate looked, I guess, two points slower than it was in the fourth quarter. Obviously you have retail store openings, you have the cycling of openings, you have you Viking businesses, et cetera and contract. To the extent that there is a comparable like for like number in any of the international businesses that you want to share with us. Can you tell us what that might have been? Bruce Nelson - Chairman and CEO - Office Depot The answer, Matt, I don't have that. I don't think it's materially different. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Company - Analyst OK. Bruce Nelson - Chairman and CEO - Office Depot As the start up businesses are small. The biggest impact in the first quarter in international was the slowing of the catalog businesses in Germany and France. The three biggest countries in Europe on the catalog side for Office Depot have always been U.K. one, Germany two, France three. U.K. we had pretty good results in the catalog businesses. But we did have slowing in Germany, frankly for the first time I would say ever in our six or seven years there. And France was exasperated by I think a geopolitical environment and economy in France and some other issues. And so those in effect leveraged down the growth rate internationally. So it was really the two countries. Softer growth rates than planned anticipated forecasts and lead would occur in France and Germany. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Company - Analyst Got you. Thank you so much. Bruce Nelson - Chairman and CEO - Office Depot Um-hmm. Operator Our next question comes from Dan Binder of Buckingham Research. 11 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Daniel Binder - Buckingham Research Group - Analyst Hi, I had a couple of questions. First, could you give us some idea in terms of the extent of testing you've done on some of the initiatives that you plan on rolling out in the latter part of Q2 and the back half of the year? And then the second question is, with regard to the direct mail business in the U.S., can you just give us some sense if there's anything you're doing there to help stimulate that business? And is Viking getting better simply as a result of user comparisons, or is there something changing there? Bruce Nelson - Chairman and CEO - Office Depot Well, the first answer, Dan, is about the testing. I won't give you a lot of insight to that. I don't think that's fair from a competitive perspective. I mean, I know you'd like to have it, and everybody would. Needless to say, I'll tell you we tested it. I mean, we're just not gonna roll out chain-wide implementations like these without tests; I mean, we just don't do it. So, we have enough concrete data in both hard data, called "comps" or "transactions," or any way you want to do it, combined with soft data, customer perception. We have total confidence in what we're doing in the categories we've rolled in the first and second quarter, and the ones we're gonna roll in the third and fourth quarter. But I really won't, Dan, for ... Daniel Binder - Buckingham Research Group - Analyst OK. Bruce Nelson - Chairman and CEO - Office Depot ... go into the specificity. Relative to Viking, Viking is comparing against negative results . And so, in that respect, there are some differences. But I will also tell you that there's been a significant number of efforts at Viking, including, for the first time, a significant effort in outbound telemarketing at the Viking operation in Southern California. Viking was always known for a catalog-only operation; no outbound telemarketers. Telemarketers have been added to the Viking operation, and we think that's part of the reason why we've got some growth. Two is, part of it is coming at some expense to high gross margins at our Viking business because we're using direct marketing, one-to-one, to drive compelling reasons why customers ought to buy from Viking. And three is we think we've revamped and gotten better at prospecting. Both targeting and prospecting margin rates are always lower than regular margin rates, and we believe that if you can get a customer the first time and look to the cost to acquire, it's a good business model. So, this is a business we've been putting emphasis on for some time. We've had a new leader of it for about 18 months. She ran our Australian business. She's highly familiar with the Viking brand. She had relocated to Del Ray Beach. She sits in the highest levels of our executive meetings, and we are coordinating and managing this business better, and we think the results from it will improve -- continue to improve. And we also think we're gonna get better; we're gonna see the slowing of the negative growth in Office Depot Catalog. And again, there's a lot of initiatives we're doing there. I'm not gonna go into highly-specific explanation of those. I'll just tell you the initiatives are many, they're specific, they're tested, they're tried, they work and we'll go at it. Daniel Binder - Buckingham Research Group - Analyst And just one follow-up question on store remodels and gross. Are you gonna give us the location of the newest format when it comes out? 12 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Bruce Nelson - Chairman and CEO - Office Depot No. Daniel Binder - Buckingham Research Group - Analyst OK. And then ... Bruce Nelson - Chairman and CEO - Office Depot Not the first one. I told you we'll get 25 to 30 of them open in the second half. When we get enough of them opened that I'm confident that's what we want it to look like, and frankly, when I get a much better handle on the leveraging of some of the costs in this new format -- because you've got to leverage some of these over multiple stores -- I will be delighted to tell you where it is. But I think it's early and not in the best interest of the - of you, my competitors, or anybody else to tell you where the store is. It will open late in this quarter. It's about 40 percent complete in construction. It's a very, very different store. I - I'll just leave you with that. It is unlike any Office Depot store; it is unlike the [Inaudible] model we had; it's unlike our competitor's remodel. It's a very, very different store. Daniel Binder - Buckingham Research Group - Analyst Anything on the cost to do these remodels? Bruce Nelson - Chairman and CEO - Office Depot Why, it's early, but I think that I mean if you look to the cost of remodeling of three to 400. I'd like it to be less than that, but if that's a range today, I think that's kind of where I am. That's a very broad range. We've got to fine-tune it. Reason we're going to open 25 or 30 of them is to fully understand it. Clearly to go north of that's going to be a problem in terms of returns I think. But I think that's a - if you want a real wide range, I think that's it. That's not finite; it's not specific; it's not designed to give you absolute. It's just to say directionally, I think that's kind of where it'll end up. Daniel Binder - Buckingham Research Group - Analyst And does that mean you'd probably need something like a low-single digit sales list to get the - to hit the hurdle rates? [Inaudible] ... Bruce Nelson - Chairman and CEO - Office Depot I think you could conclude that, but also I think you have to recognize, and you've all pointed this out, so one of our challenges that we have that makes us a little different than our two primary superstore competitors in comp growth is our store age is older by some years. I mean it's significantly older than Staples and somewhat older than Max. We've not put money back into our stores the last two or three years as we've worked to find a design that works. And therefore, part of our cap ex in the remodeled stores has to be to maintain and even slightly grow our current position because new - because old stores get tired. And so, part of it's that way. But the answer is, "Sure." You can do the math. You've got to have single-digit growth out of this to [Inaudible] get a return, but we've got some - we've got some pretty exciting things. And I'll tell you, I - this is a great store. And we've got to get some data behind us before we roll it out to hundreds, but I'll tell you if we get the initial response in reality that we get from the way we've been able to test it, this could be hundreds of stores next year. We'll see. I'll give you a lot more guidance later on this year as we get the first one open and a few more open so you can go see them. 13 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Daniel Binder - Buckingham Research Group - Analyst And last, could you just give us some sense of what part of that three to 400 is expensed versus capitalized? Bruce Nelson - Chairman and CEO - Office Depot No. Daniel Binder - Buckingham Research Group - Analyst No? OK, thanks. Bruce Nelson - Chairman and CEO - Office Depot No, that's as wide - that's directionally all I want to do at this point. Daniel Binder - Buckingham Research Group - Analyst OK, thanks. Bruce Nelson - Chairman and CEO - Office Depot Yes, I'm trying to balance for all of you the need for detail which you all have, the need for specificity which you all want, with the direction I want to take the company without getting down to specifics. But the sum total of the discussion I had on the first quarter was "I'm not going to tell you" didn't work so well, so I'm now going to tell you. But I just - I'm not, from a competitive perspective, going to build a lot around it until it's more specific. And so, ink and toner is much more specific. We have 500-plus stores up and operating as of today. And that's much more specific, so I feel more free to talk about it. So, thanks, Dan . Daniel Binder - Buckingham Research Group - Analyst Great, thanks. Operator Our next question comes from Colin McGranahan of Sanford Bernstein. You may ask your question. Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc. - Analyst Good morning, Bruce. We definitely like the "tell us" rather than the "not tell us" a lot ... Bruce Nelson - Chairman and CEO - Office Depot OK. 14 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc. - Analyst On that - on that topic, just an easy one first - the guidance for the second quarter then, that's two cents below the GAAP of 18 cents last year, so you're essentially guiding to 16 cents? Bruce Nelson - Chairman and CEO - Office Depot Guys, I think - I think if you - to put a number to it, Colin - because I think - I hedge a little bit. One cent of EPS at Office Depot equals about $4.5 million. It's pretty finite. So if you said 16 to 18 cents as a range for the second quarter on GAAP, I'm comfortable in that range. We will do our best to drive that to the high end of the range. Some of these marketing initiatives and merchandizing initiatives are early in retail and the key to driving this is North American retail sales. So in that range I'd say I'm comfortable for the second quarter. Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc. - Analyst Got you. I just following up on one of Dan's questions, on the new stores in the millennium. First, in terms of the adding these smaller stores and increasing density, I mean, what are you anticipating in terms of cannibalization in the market, like Miami-Dade where you're you know, increasing your concentration by 50 percent? Bruce Nelson - Chairman and CEO - Office Depot Well, it's not just Miami-Dad. It's three counties. It's Miami-Dade, West Palm and Broward. You got to take those three together. So it's not just Miami-Dade to be clear, where we already have significant numbers of stores. Two is we will take some cannibalization. It depends on how close, obviously you put the store to a bigger store. Most of these will be smaller stores. So we'll take cannibalization, but frankly, our perspective Colin is when we look at market share in South Florida, look at density in South Florida, this is our home. This is where we live. This is where we've got enormously high brand recognition that we think it does two things. One is every time frankly we put a store in South Florida in the last two or three years, it's surprised us pleasantly by how well it's performed, even with cannibalization. And second of all, I would rather cannibalize myself than have someone else cannibalize me. And in markets where we have a presence, I want to be known for that presence. I think frankly one of the lessons learned from the ill-fated store ramp out of Office Depot in 1999, '98, and early 2000 was to not focus on density. And I don't want to make that same mistake again. And I'm confident we now got a model that we can make work where we have larger stores that surround us. We've got some really interesting stories of smaller stores. They're exciting. Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc. - Analyst In terms of 2004, the 70 to 80 stores, any sense of, you know, could some of those be millenniums, how many of those will be kind of 10,000 square foot stores, new markets versus in-fill? Bruce Nelson - Chairman and CEO - Office Depot I would say if we look at 70 to 80 stores in 2004, we'd have 80 to 90 percent of those stores in Office Depot existing markets where we already have a fairly significant presence. By the way that presence could be three stores in a market where nobody has any. I mean that's just, so it's relative. 15 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Two is, again, I think, these stores that will open in millennium will be in the late quarter, later in the half as opposed to earlier. As quick as we get a handle on what they're doing, frankly, I'd like to get as many new stores in 2004 in that format as possible. So you know, it just depends. I think again, we've got to get enough open to understand before we go to new stores and again, a 10,000 square foot store is not going to give you the same impact of a millennia store that an existing 22,000 does. But millennia isn't just a small format. That part I want to make clear. Millennium fits from 20 to 36,000 feet, it just means you expand it. So Millennium is not a small store format. Millennium is a new store format and frankly as quick as we can get our arms around it, and understand what it does, I would hope that most of our new stores, in 2004, will be of a millennium format. The quicker we can do that, the better, and we're not, you know, stores open in the first quarter of 2004 may be difficult, because in some cases, we've already started and got construction plans. So those you want to be careful about changing, because of cost. So I hope that gives you some insight. Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc. - Analyst Right, yes, so there won't be any new millennium stores this year, right? Those will all just be remods? Bruce Nelson - Chairman and CEO - Office Depot No there's one new millennium opening in this quarter; it's a new store. Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc. - Analyst OK. It's a new store. Bruce Nelson - Chairman and CEO - Office Depot It's a brand new site, brand new store. Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc. - Analyst Got you. Bruce Nelson - Chairman and CEO - Office Depot One, 25 to 30 stores will open in the second half. They're skewed towards the last half of this year, not the first half of, the last half of the second half will all be remodeled. Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc. - Analyst OK, just one final quick question. You know these merchandizing initiatives sound interesting, hopeful. Can you give us, would you care to give us any sense of what you're seeing, April so far, overall comps in North America retail? 16 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Bruce Nelson - Chairman and CEO - Office Depot No, I would just tell you the comp trends improved, slightly improved in the last week of March. They have been on improving trends, April to date. We think a significant driver of those overall comp trends is the ink and toner shops. Ink and toner shops from the stores they're in, are outperforming the chain, where we don't have it, that's why we are more confident about our ability to, so that we one, bottomed out, if you will, on the comps negative rate North America, and two, that will give us some lift in the second quarter as the rest of these stores come online. Remember we don't get the whole chain until the first or second week of May. Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc. - Analyst Great. Thanks, Bruce. Bruce Nelson - Chairman and CEO - Office Depot You're welcome. Operator Our next question comes from Michael Baker of Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question. Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank - Analyst Hi. Thanks. Two questions, one, did just want a little bit more clarity on the '03 outlook. So when you're talking about three to four percent growth on the 2002 GAAP numbers, so that's three to five percent growth on the 98 cents that you reported for GAAP last year? Bruce Nelson - Chairman and CEO - Office Depot Yes. Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank - Analyst OK, so that's about a $1.01 to $1.03. OK, got it, and then, so then the next question I have relates to some of the supplier issues that you had in your, in your CTO kiosk. Has that been fixed and is that something, or is that something that you're continuing to try improvement on? Bruce Nelson - Chairman and CEO - Office Depot The answer to the question is about to get, the answer is it's much better than it was. I mean frankly we were running at 28 days and it's down to roughly 10. It's still unacceptable to us. When you can figure the order to compete with people with Dell and IBM, you can't be at 28 days. And it has hurt our business and that frankly, last year, was the best part of our desktop business. It grew the fastest last year. So it has hurt us. But it is down to 10 days today. We're putting pressure on our supplier to get it better and we will look, also look at alternatives to make sure we have the best alternatives our customers can have in this regard. In that regard, we have and continue to use our acquisition of Forsure.com to help our retail stores get better access to technology, because this is a great company that we acquired last year, doing very well by the way, growing nicely and outperforming frankly at this stage what we thought it would do at Office Depot. So, and that's helping us leverage that expertise across, not only retail, but our DSP group as well. 17 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank - Analyst OK, sounds good. And then the last question, is some of these changes that you're making, like adding space for the ink and toner that you talked about, you're going to add a couple of linear feed for the writing instruments. Is that replacing anything or is that just a reconfiguration of the store, if you're taking the managing of ... Bruce Nelson - Chairman and CEO - Office Depot You have to be careful Michael to generalize, because you got to understand these stores. The average square foot of ink and toner in most stores is 600, but we've got some that go down to 400, some that are a little larger, depending on the store size. And so that's really fitting and that's why it takes 200 to 300 to 350 hours in some stores to reconfigure, because you're moving a lot of steel. Because you want that shop at the front of the store. The second question on ink is again, in our larger stores one of the -- remember, we've got an advantage in one respect. It's been in some respects a disadvantage, because our stores are larger than our competitors on average. That gets back to the average age. We can incrementally add eight feet of writing instruments in a lot of our stores here in North America and just take up some additional space and not push anything out. Third, is we have -- because in some smaller stores if you add eight feet of writing instruments and then put in ink and toner -- and frankly, in some stores, we have a thing called Quick Shop -- we've had to position some other items. And so we've taken a look at our skew mix and I'd prefer not to go into the specificity of that. But in some skews we've reduced and some other areas we've cutback that we don't think overall contribute significantly to the sales of an Office Depot store. Or, more importantly, to a market basket. And that's kind of how we have to look at things. So, the answer is in some cases there are fewer skews, but in general we're able to fit this in most of our existing stores. Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank - Analyst But net isn't it a little bit of an increase in the total skew count when we look at both ... Bruce Nelson - Chairman and CEO - Office Depot ... and I'd say if you add net, the answer is that it's a slight increase in skews. Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank - Analyst OK. Great. Thank you. Bruce Nelson - Chairman and CEO - Office Depot You're welcome. Operator Our next question comes from David Cass of Matrix . You may ask your question. 18 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call David Katz - Matrix - Analyst Hey, guys. Bruce, in light of the weak stock price and what appears to be fairly favorable intermediate term prospects, do you expect to do any insider buying or to buy any of the stock? And do you think any of your new management team is going to step in at some point? Bruce Nelson - Chairman and CEO - Office Depot You know, David , I don't know the answer to my executives, because I think that's always a personal decision. Two is I would tell you that we have a significant number of short windows at Office Depot in which we can either buy or sell. And given the length of time we've been engaged with Guilbert, we virtually had no windows. Three is I think the stock's compelling and I don't think this is the place for me to articular my personal plans about stock. I do personally own a fair amount of Office Depot stock. And in fact, realistically, most of my relatively speaking small wealth is tied up in owning of Office Depot stock personally as well as my options, which are skin in the game, frankly, and are an incentive for me and the others to grow shareholder value. I would also add we were one of the first companies to premium price options. And a significant portion of my options are premium priced. And a significant number of them are out of the money. And I want you to know both from a personal perspective and a business perspective nothing would make me happier than to drive the value of our stock. And that's why on the Guilbert transaction, by the way, we had a contingent price that said if our stock hits $20.00 in five consecutive days, 18 months after we close we'll deliver stock. And I kiddingly said and said to my colleague Serge Weinberg at PPR, I'll personally deliver you the stock or cash gain if it gets 20 in 18 months. And believe me, this management team is doing everything we know how to get it there. I would also say to you that we've said all along that we'll use our cash to grow our business. If we can't find ways to grow the business we'll give it back to shareholders. And we do have a strong cash position. We're going to use a fair amount of it for Guilbert, assuming that EU approves. But you know what? We've still got positive cash flow in this business. We have virtually untapped credit lines. And so this is a business that can grow itself both by using cash to grow and if we can't find high returns that grow that way, we'll give it back to shareholders. I've always said that, and that's not changed. David Katz - Matrix - Analyst Thank you. Operator Our last question comes from Bill Patzer . You may ask your question. Bill Patser - Analyst - Analyst Hi, Bruce. The question I wanted to ask was about the low sales or the declining sales North American retail. And I've heard about what you're doing in terms of positive initiatives, but I didn't hear an assessment of the competitive situation. Who is it you're losing - obviously losing share to the other office retailers. Are you losing share to anybody else? And what do you think the specific reasons you're losing share are in the categories where you're doing so poorly? In other words, I want to understand how your fixes - what your fixes are actually trying to address [Inaudible] . 19 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Bruce Nelson - Chairman and CEO - Office Depot Well, I'm about to make an absurd statement you'll think I'm partly crazy on, but I do not believe we are losing share to either Office Max or Staples, to be specific. And I could go into a long explanation of that. A lot has to do where Staples has stores and we don't. A lot has to do with the presence they have in Canada where they don't have a competitor. A lot has to do with store age. I can tell you the market basket of our small and medium-sized business that's loyal to Office Depot - I do not believe we've lost share. There is some share loss from this channel to others in some important categories. I believe ink has been one of them, and I believe that share is going to a variety of people. It's not one. It's not just Wal-Mart. It's Walgreen's; it's gas stations that put out [Inaudible] ink cartridges. The way to compete against that is to make ink a destination. I said [Inaudible] on this category. None of them have devoted the space, the education, the technology, the easy-to-find, easy-to-get, easy-to-deliver the way we market and sell it in totality, and none of them have done that. So, I think there is some share loss in some categories to other players. I think in writing instruments, we made some Plan-A-Gram changes a year ago in writing instruments that cost us share. I believe that the changes we'll make by the end of the second quarter will not only gain back that share we lost in that category - the fifth largest category in store - in our store, but will gain share in it. So, you know, the insight into this is complex because then you've got to talk about markets by category. We've clearly lost share in technology. And if you go back two-and-a-half - three years ago, 25 percent of our North American retail sales were in desktops, laptops, printers, monitors, all-in-one machines. That's down to 10 - 11 percent of our business. While the market's declined, our share of that market has gone down more and we will take steps to address that in the second half. So, it's a very broad question. It takes an awful lot more time than I've got. I know people come to the conclusion since Max's comps and Staples' comps are better than ours, we must be losing share to them. And as I've said, certainly in a store or two, of course you lose share. In a market, I don't think so, and across the board, I don't think so. Again, commenting on a competitor, which people say you're not [Inaudible] to do, clearly Max is a better company today than they were a year ago and that gives them a higher lift in their comps. And so, they're comparing, frankly, to a company a year ago that was having trouble in supply chain. But we're focused on share. We're focused on detonation . We're focused on being a choice of our business customer in retail to beat category teams in four or five things. I would also tell you that our core customer has always been a small and medium-sized business. And frankly, where we compete - that is where we have stores, aligned with Staples and Max, we in totality have a higher share of the small business - medium business customer than our competitor has in the same market. That's always been Office Depot's strength, that continues to be our strength, and we'll build on that strength. That segment, as an example, had a more difficult time economically this past year or two [Inaudible] historically has. That's not an excuse; it's just a fact. So I hope that gives you, David, a little more insight into your kind of complex question. And I know you didn't mean it that way, but it requires an awful lot of explanation. Part of it - it's not - neither time-wise to do it nor competitive-wise to go into more specificity than I have. I hope I've give you some perspective of it, and I want to leave you the fact that we've studied this well. This is not - this is not something on the surface we just scratched at. And it's this scratching and digging that caused us last fall to say there's five big initiatives we're going to do. And I've identified what those are and I've added one to it. So, hopefully, that'll give you confidence we've got our arms on what needs to be done. Bill Patser - Analyst - Analyst Sure. That was - that was helpful. I would ask one other follow-up if I could. Just and - at some point are you prepared to consider a change in your retail management of your North American retail if the comps don't turn around? 20 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Bruce Nelson - Chairman and CEO - Office Depot Well, I think that's a - the broad answer to that question is always, "Yes, of course you are." But do I think a change is required? Do I think this is about leadership? No, I don't. I mean if you ask my Board are they prepared to make a change to the CEO of the company if he or she doesn't perform? Absolutely. Tangible evidence? They made a change three years ago. So the answer to that question in a broad aspect is, "Yes." But do I think the head of our retail organization is under-performing and therefore ought to be changed? The answer is, "No, I do not." Bill Patser - Analyst - Analyst OK, I appreciate it. Bruce Nelson - Chairman and CEO - Office Depot I have confidence in the leadership of my retail organization. I have confidence in the leadership team most of whom are in this room with me today. I've said that to them privately. I've said to them publicly. Now I've had private discussions with every one of them about how I think they can improve, and they're all smiling because I'm pretty direct. So, ... Bill Patser - Analyst - Analyst OK. Bruce Nelson - Chairman and CEO - Office Depot ... the answer is, "I believe we know what to do. I believe we have the wherewithal to do it. I believe we have the ability to execute it." I believe ink and toner shops in two-and-a-half months, 870 stores is but a small indication of that capability, and I am confident that we'll get better results for North American retail. Having said that, we still all need some economic good news in this country - frankly, the world to get us to where we all want to be. That's reality. OK, I'm going to summarize the call in a statement I made. I remember it well in July of 2000 when I had the opportunity to become the CEO of Office Depot. It's a one-line summary. It says, "I would not bet against Office Depot in the long term." I said that then; I say it today. We've come through interesting times. We are focused on what's important to our company, important to our people, important to our shareholders, and important to the public. We will not lose that focus. [Inaudible] will help us achieve our dream of being the world's leader in selling office supplies to small, medium, and large businesses across multiple brands, multiple channels, and multiple countries. We've demonstrated we've done it. We will demonstrate in the future we'll do it in spite of short-term economic difficulties and short-term economic challenges. Thanks for your confidence in Office Depot. Thanks for taking the time to listen to us today. It's a confusing period of time complicated by the adoption of EITF-0216. Feel free to call Eileen or Charlie for more clarification of that. We tried to give you enormous insight to it. More importantly, we tried to give you some insight to where we think this business goes. I end by saying I am not overoptimistic about the geopolitical environment or the economic environment, either North America or Europe. I am incredibly optimistic about Office Depot's ability to perform in the long term. Thanks for your time and thanks for your support. Have a great day. 21 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

MAY 05, 2003 / 8:00PM, - Q1 2003 Tele Nordeste Celular Earnings Conference Call Rogiero Leda - Tele Nordeste Celular - CCO Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us today. After a brief overview of the results we will be happy to answer any questions you may have. My comments will follow the presentation that is available on the internet. Starting on page two, the presentation will be in three parts. First 2003 strategy. Second, first quarter 2003 key performance indicators, such as customer base, subscriber acquisition costs and gross addition, Churn, MOU and the ARPU. And third, first quarter 2003 financial review, such as revenue, EBITDA, CAPEX and Net Profit. Moving on to page three I would like to mention our main strategy for 2003. During 2003 Tele Nordeste will direct its efforts towards profitable growth, maintaining and reinforcing its leadership in the region. In particular, Tele Nordeste strategy in 2003 will be customer base retention and loyalty, a strong focus on ARPU, GSM launching, capitalizing on TIM's national footprint, development and launching of new services, and CAPEX and OPEX optimization. Now, going into the results of the first quarter 2003, I would like to summarize some of the company's [indiscernible]. On page four we would like to show our customer base. As you can see we grew 9.3% in relation to the same period of last year, strengthening our position as market leader, which we estimated to be 59% of market share. A breakdown of our 1,977,000 total customer base is 65% prepaid and 35% postpaid. Moving on to page five, we can see the subscriber acquisition costs and gross additions. Subscriber acquisition costs was in line with our strategy. That is focus on growth with profitability. But at the same time managing our market share. We would like to point out the composition of the gross additions. Despite the smaller total gross addition of 122,000 in the first quarter 2003, against 147,000 in the first quarter 2002. The quality of acquisition in the first quarter 2003--I mean the amount and composition of postpaid, was much better. On the following page, page six, I would like to highlight the drop in churn year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, as a result of a strong retention campaign and our customer loyalty program. Moving now to page seven you can see the MOU trend. The MOU decrease is attributed to the reduction of the incoming traffic. But despite this effect, there was a growth in the outgoing traffic year-over-year, as a result of our focus towards profitability. That is, acquiring and developing customers with good service. Moving to page eight, I would like to point out the continuous improvement of the short message volumes which grew by 244% year-over-year. A total of 117.9m messages were sent during the last quarter. Customers are charged for messages from one cellular to another. Or, they can send messages through our website at no charge. Let's move now to page nine, where we can see the ARPU. The slight decrease in the ARPU year-over-year is due to the growth of the prepaid customer base, and the reduction of the incoming traffic, as I mentioned before. In addition it is important to consider the seasonality growth on the second half of the year, as well as the slowing down of the economy in the first quarter 2003. This is the end of the second part of our presentation. Now I will pass you on to Mr. Walmir Kesseli, Tele Nordeste CFO, who will review the company's financial performance. Walmir Kesseli - Tele Nordeste Celular - CFO Hi everyone, let's review Tele Nordeste Celular financial performance. On page 10 we can see a growth of 11% of the net revenues year-over-year, R$211.2m against R$234.5m. That was a growth of 119% of the handsets revenues, and (inaudible) for service revenue which shows a continued increase. 3 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

MAY 05, 2003 / 8:00PM, - Q1 2003 Tele Nordeste Celular Earnings Conference Call Moving to the next page, 11, let's look at the EBITDA figures. On the left side it shows the performance of the first quarters of the year 2003 against first quarter of year 2002 in medium of Reals, while on the right side in percentage is comparing the first quarter of year 2002 to the first quarter of year 2003. In the first quarter of year 2003 Tele Nordeste reported a consolidated EBITDA of R$101.6m, representing 43.3 margin against R$94.4m of first quarter of year 2003, which represents 44% margin. Despite the small decrease in terms of the percentage in margin, there was an increase in terms of the total amount. In this sense we would like to point out that we keep pursuing growth with profitability. On page 12, let's have a comparison on EBITDA within the Net Services revenues only. In fact, considering only the Net Services revenue, as you can see the EBITDA margin is even better. In the first quarter year 2003 we registered a margin of 47.1% compared with 45.4% of year 2002. Despite the strengthening of the competition we have been successful in keeping growth of our services margin. On the next page 13, let's have a look at the CAPEX figures. In the first quarter of the year it was R$5.9m against R$8.7m in the year 2002. This amount of investment was mainly directed to the optimization of the company process, CRN (ph.) and new products, strengthening more and more the relationship with its customers. As a strategy of the company we are concentrating the investments on the second and third quarters of the year. On the next page, 14, we have the bottom line results. The net profit increased from R$23.2m on the first quarter of 2002, to R$33m for the first quarter of 2003, which represents a wonderful performance in terms of growth of 42.2%. That concludes the company financial performance. I will now turn it back to Mr. Leda. Rogiero Leda - Tele Nordeste Celular - CCO Thanks Walmir. Finally, on the last page, page 15, I would like to conclude by saying that our focus to 2003 will be customer base retention and loyalty + stimulate use, increase of revenue per user + customer base qualitative growth = growth with profitability. We believe that this equation is the core of our strategy. Well, ladies and gentlemen. Thanks for participating with us on this conference, and we are ready now to answer any question you might have. Thank you very much again. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Operator Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question and answer session. If you have a question or comment, please press the star key, followed by the 1 key on your touchtone now. If at any time you would like to remove yourself from the questioning queue, please press star, 2. Please restrict your questions to two at a time. Our first question comes from Andre Gadelha with Banco Pactual. Andre Gadelha - Banco Pactual - Analyst Hi everyone, good results. Congratulations. I'd like to know what the decrease is on your prepaid ARPUs quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, please, just the decrease? And the second question is regarding the competitive environment. Could you please elaborate a little bit more on the current competitive environment? Could you compare the competitive environment of today and what was happening one year ago at the same time? Thank you. 4 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

MAY 05, 2003 / 8:00PM, - Q1 2003 Tele Nordeste Celular Earnings Conference Call Rogiero Leda - Tele Nordeste Celular - CCO Andre, it's Rogiero speaking. What was the first part of your question? Your question of the Andre Gadelha - Banco Pactual - Analyst I'd like to know the decrease of the prepaid ARPU, what was it 5%, 10% on your prepaid ARPU quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year, please? Only on your prepaid ARPU. Rogiero Leda - Tele Nordeste Celular - CCO Yes, our prepaid ARPU maintained almost stable. Andre Gadelha - Banco Pactual - Analyst Quarter-over-quarter? Rogiero Leda - Tele Nordeste Celular - CCO Yes. Quarter-over-quarter, because what we are doing with prepaid is just to stimulate the recharge (ph.). Then year-over-year, we have ARPU almost stable. The second part is the competition environment that year-over-year. Of course now that there was strength in the competitive environment. But I would say that Tele Nordeste Celular was prepared to receive the competition. Now what we are doing is just drive strategy to the niche of the market where the best value is. Just because the tradition of the Tele Nordeste Celular we can acquire the best customers in the market, as you saw in our presentation. Andre Gadelha - Banco Pactual - Analyst I see, but do you believe that the competition environment is fiercer now than it was last year in the beginning of the year with the entrance of (inaudible) at that time? Rogiero Leda - Tele Nordeste Celular - CCO Of course we are facing stronger competition. But as we mentioned in our presentation, this competition affected the gross addition, but what Tele Nordeste Celular did was just to move and to directly its (inaudible) to the best (inaudible) of the market. If you compare the first quarter of 2002 against the first quarter of 2003, you saw in the first quarter of 2002 a higher number of gross additions, but with less participation of postpaid. That's why the ARPU is better. Andre Gadelha - Banco Pactual - Analyst Okay. And just one more question. The decrease in the incoming traffic, do you attribute this to the elasticity (ph.) of traffic? I mean do you think the decrease was related to the increasing interconnection rates, or do you have another reason? 5 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

MAY 05, 2003 / 8:00PM, - Q1 2003 Tele Nordeste Celular Earnings Conference Call Rogiero Leda - Tele Nordeste Celular - CCO No, I think that is a mix, it's a blend. The most important cause of the reduction on incoming traffic was just the fixed line that blocked calls to the cellular (inaudible). This was a big problem for us. Andre Gadelha - Banco Pactual - Analyst Okay. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you for your question, sir. Our next question comes from Andrew Campbell with Credit Suisse First Boston. Sir, please go ahead. Andrew Campbell - Credit Suisse First Boston - Analyst I was wondering if you could give us an update on the GSM overlay? When will you first be launching that, in what cities, and what the timeline is for the rollout? And also, what the latest figures in terms of what you expect to spend? Thank you. Rogiero Leda - Tele Nordeste Celular - CCO Hi, Andrew, it's Rogiero speaking. Our strategy to launch off GSM is during the second half of the year. The strategy for coverage and our footprint is just to launch it to the main metropolitan areas of our region. We have six states here in Tele Nordeste Celular. And the investment that we are doing throughout the year will be around R$300m. Andrew Campbell - Credit Suisse First Boston - Analyst Okay, do you plan to market aggressively the new GSM handsets to your customers, or is it really more of a limited launch? How exactly do you plan to promote that? Rogiero Leda - Tele Nordeste Celular - CCO Andrew, as you know we have now a TDMA (ph.) base, but when we launch the GSM handsets we will be the only operator that will be poised for the market. TDMA and GSM depends on the needs of the customer. Then our strategy is not to be aggressive and to subsidize heavily the GSM handsets. Andrew Campbell - Credit Suisse First Boston - Analyst Okay, thanks Rogiero. Operator Thank you for your question Mr. Campbell. Our next question comes from Roger Oey with BBVA.

MAY 05, 2003 / 8:00PM, - Q1 2003 Tele Nordeste Celular Earnings Conference Call Roger Oey - BBVA - Analyst Thank you. Good afternoon. On the balance sheet I saw a very strong increase in your other short term assets from R$3.m to R$42m in the first quarter. Also in the long term assets you had also an increase from R$12m to R$35m. I'd like an explanation for that. What's happening, why other assets are increasing that much? And was it the reason for net cash to remain flat in the first quarter? Do you have a guidance on your cash flow generation for this year? Do you think it's going to be flat considering next year because of the GSM investment? Thank you. Walmir Kesseli - Tele Nordeste Celular - CFO Walmir speaking. In terms of our cash flow for by the end of this year, we are still working in order to make the same trend that you had last year. Of course during the first quarter of the year considering that we didn't spend a lot of money in terms of CAPEX, we face some growth debts that considering that our net financial position by the end of the year, the first quarter was increasing 91% in, comparison with the same (inaudible) last year. I didn't catch your first question in terms of some detail that you saw in our balance sheet. Could you repeat please? Roger Oey - BBVA - Analyst Yes, the other assets, you have other short term assets, they were R$3.0m at the end of last year, and then they are now at R$42m, it's an increase of almost R$40m in the short term. And the long term assets you had R$12m and now it's R$35m, so you had an increase of let's say R$20m. So altogether you have almost R$60m increase in other assets that are not explained in the balance sheet. At the same time your net cash position remains flat, so I was wondering where TND is allocating its cash generation this first quarter? Walmir Kesseli - Tele Nordeste Celular - CFO I don't have more details to give you, but we can open this details and are going to send you -- But I can confirm that we don't have any position other than to send money to the [indiscernible] -- give it a moment because I can do it here right now, okay.

And what can we expect in the second quarter in terms of subscriber acquisition costs, given that we have Mothers Day and Valentines Day in the second quarter? Thanks. Rogiero Leda - Tele Nordeste Celular - CCO Rogiero speaking. The cause of the increase in the subscriber acquisition costs in the first quarter against the last quarter of 2002 is because we were managing the competition, as I said before. Okay? Just to manage our acquisition costs depends on if the competition is more aggressive or not. But as we know in the second quarter of the year, just because of Mother's day, that's the second season of sales in the year, you have just now in May.

The average sales price is the average sales price of the market, because we are just in line with the market. And it depends on the tier that you would like to attack.

(Timsul) Earnings Conference Call Our priority remains attracting and maintaining the high value customers. And for that we strengthened our corporate division resulting in the leverage of the sales in that segment. Which in turn exceeded the goals for the period. Also the corporate service plans launched in late 2002 and became top sellers in the region. Our customer relations and customer loyalty efforts resulted in the stabilization of the post paid customer base. And we will continue the strong efforts to increase the customer satisfaction. Moreover, we count on a strong selling channel and have several activities under way to further strengthen our ties with our partners. For instance, we held this year two conventions and more than 1,500 have been regularly trained to offer the best customer service. I invite you to explore (ph) with me during this first quarter. And my comments will follow the slide presentation that's all ready been mentioned that's available on our Web site. The slide one the factors leading in new acquisition. As you can see even in a competitive market gross additions (ph) showed 57 percent year-over-year growth. We posted 124,000 gross additions in the first quarter. We estimate -, gross sales share of 53 percent in our market despite -, pricing of our competition. We believe we have reached another great balance between growth and un-profitability. The launching of new products and services, the quality of the service provide and the creation of a customer relations center focus in offering solutions tailored to specific needs effective the helping us to maintain our -, position. And at the same time allowing us to pursue new possibilities. The slide number two with the title maintain -, base. We close the quarter with 1,753,000 subscribers. And that increase of 139,000 new customers year-over-year. We maintain the four percent -, of best (ph) customers across all segments. And on a fixed control of debt. It's worth pointing out that the post paid customer base has begun to stabilize and also increase in the past two months. Extension -- well the next slide please. Number three expansion of value added service. The mobile originate short message service, SMS, has shown substantial growth during the first quarter of this year. We registered 34 million bit (ph) message compared to 14 million in the first quarter of the last year. This is only mobile originated. We will maintain our efforts increased usage of MOSMS and usage of T-Net (ph) services such as information services Ringtons (ph), SMS, Shot (ph) service name blah (ph) and others. SMS also has a strong growth potential in the corporate segment. And therefore, we have created a specific organization to explore such opportunities and increase VAS in the corporate market. We expect to keep increase our share of VAS in total revenues as the market matures. The next slide, please, number four, -, increase in RPU. The RPU for the quarter was 43 reals, 10 percent above the first quarter of last year. All state customers show that year-over-year growth of 23 percent -, as a result of efforts such as customer loyalty programs, segmented retention policies, the launch of the new portfolio service plans, improvement of solutions for team (ph) business and others. The pre paid RPU also grew by five percent despite the growth of -- in the customer base. The next slide please. Slide number five, revenue growth. The net -, revenue in first quarter of this year was 17 percent higher than the proceeding year thanks to the extension of subscriber base in the period. Followed by the total revenue, total profit increase, and the rates, the service increased as well. -, revenue grew by 40 percent due to the growth in the new acquisitions. OK. The next slide please, slide number six. Decrease in bad debt expenses were 5.5 million of -, or 1.7 percent of the total gross revenues. And last -- in the first quarter of last year we had 3.6 percent of total gross revenues. As a result -- this is a result of the improved factors in collecting over due dues and the implementation of the new collection procedures during the period. Churn has been approximately 1.8 percent per month remaining stable at the level that we have the last year. OK. Next slide please, EBITDA. As you can see in this slide we achieve an EBITDA of 98.8 million of reals, six percent above the first quarter of 2002. And that means an EBITDA margin of 44.2 percent over the net service revenue, consistent with the strategy of combining growth and profitability. Next slide, strong cash flow generation.

TSU has one of the lowest levels of debts in the Brazilian mobile telephone industry. Next slide please. Bottom line improvements. The net income for the quarter was 29 million of reals with -, a 57 percent over the proceeding year, mainly due to the revenue increase. I would like also to mention that before closing our presentation, I would like to mention that something I think could have an important impact on the coming quarters. As the markets may be know in December 2002, we entered in a new agreement with Matel (ph) which resulted in the integration from the mobile cellular services -, to the personal mobile service. No -, fees. So we'll cease operations on the public system concession and start operating the private system authorization. In general, the major charge resulted from the migration are concerned with the new quality indicators and the selection of the long-distance carrier by the customer. In this case, TSU will be granted a long-distance license for division. The new partner in our service must be available to the market by June of this year. The company has focused -, to antiquated systems and procedures to the new requirements, in order to provide an efficient transition to customers. The -, TSU to acquire an extra frequency in the 1,800 -, in order to develop this GSM network. So by the end o f this semester TSU will be offering GSM service (ph) in this region. The implementation of the GSM network overlay will be entirely founded through current available cash, plus the cash generation expected over the next two years. Regarding the competitive environment, TSU prepared to face the entrance of new competitors in the market because we believe that a more competitive market highlights those companies that are staffed by the best teams with the best -, software and the best practice and services. That concludes our presentation. Thanks again for your interest in our company. And we are now ready to answer any questions you might have.

(Timsul) Earnings Conference Call Alvaro Moraes - TSU - Chief Executive Officer OK. Thank you. Well I will answer your questions starting from the last one we had an increasing in SAC as you can see in this first quarter. Actually, our strategy is to increase growth position in the beginning as recently as two or maybe the three quarters of the year as a prevention from the coming of the competition in the market as a normal movement. And that means that we are striving our efforts in the selling activities. I believe that this next quarter, we still have an increase -- we may have an increase in SAC for the quarter because this quarter we have some very important peer (ph) sales with Mother's Day and Valentine's Day and that versus for the SAC. I believe that for the remaining quarters of the year, we'll have a decrease. And that means that for the remaining of the year, we may have levels that we have in the first quarter of the year. Considering the positive RPU and the numbers that you asked that refers to Mauricio Roorda, that's the marketing director to see if he has all of the points that you ask. Just a minute. Excuse me your questions were -- could you repeat your questions about RPU so we can ... Andre Gadalla - Banco Practell OK. Yes, first of all you said that the prepaid RPU increased by five percent. I'd like to know if it was on a year-over-year basis or quarter-over-quarter. Alvaro Moraes - TSU - Chief Executive Officer OK. Andre Gadalla - Banco Practell And my second question was regarding the post paid RPU and was increased on the post paid RPU. Mauricio Roorda - TSU - Chief Marketing Officer Yes, OK.

You mentioned that the GSM loss was going to be ready, if I understood properly by the end of the first semester, is that right? Alvaro Moraes - TSU - Chief Executive Officer Yes, that's right.

What kind of a launch is the pitcher (ph) planning? Is it a very limited launch? And what's your plan for the roll out of the GSM? Alvaro Moraes - TSU - Chief Executive Officer OK. Well actually we spent some amount of money in preparing the network for the launch of GSM. Actually as we have TME (ph) and that's what spread all over our region. We are preparing the sides to receive GSM equipment. We don't need probably at the beginning much more sites than what we have now. At the beginning, of course, we will start by the capitals of the states where we are operating. And after we have some good coverage and good -, the capital states of -, and -, we will start spreading the GSM coverage following the idea of covering the most profitable regions. By the end of this semester we will start operating in the capitals. Andrew Campbell - Credit Suisse First Boston OK. Great.

Alvaro Moraes - TSU - Chief Executive Officer Well we were supposed to start a little -- we were planning for the first year of the plan GSM something around 250, 270 million REIs for year cap ex.

We will continue the pay off of dividends in the way we have been doing until now. That's our provision for the near future. And you asked about the impact of the new taxes on the revenue. I think that we have the revenues for the quarter all ready incorporate the effects of this tax increase. So we don't see further any effects in the future -- near future. OK.

Our next question comes from Laura Milo (ph) with Centender (ph). Laura Milo - Centender Hi, my question is if you guys can anticipate what kind of increase in sales expenses for the launch of the new GSM services. And what we can -- what can we expect in terms of margins going forward? Alvaro Moraes - TSU - Chief Executive Officer OK. Mauricio Roorda - TSU - Chief Marketing Officer OK. With respect to the launch of GSM what we anticipate is that our operation will go on with a similar margins as we have today. So we don't expect a growth in sales expenses with the launch of GSM. In terms of margin, what we expect is that we will operate this year, as all ready mentioned by Mr. Moraes. We'll have a strong period of Mother's Day and Valentine's Day campaign's right now. But we expect to operate with EBITDA margins around 40 percent for the next quarters. 7 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

JULY 23, 2003 / 1:30PM, IBKC - Q2 2003 IBERIABANK CORP Earnings Conference Call DARYL BYRD - IBERIABANK Corporation - President and CEO Good morning, folks. First I want to thank my associates for their dedication and focus this quarter. In April we completed the systems conversion related to the Acadiana Bancshares combination. There was much planning and many long hours associated with this effort. To everyone's credit the conversion appears to have been almost flawless. We have proven our ability to assimilate acquired franchises in a high-quality planned focused manner. I also want to thank our people for yet another quarter of continuous improvement. Over the last weekend I spent a good bit of time reading over press releases for some of our peers for the second quarter. It appears the national economy and the flat yield curve have created a difficult operating environment. Many banks are scrambling and earnings quality is suspect. We have consistently stated that low rates and a relatively flat yield curve create the most difficult environments for bank profitability. Fortunately, in contrast to so many banks and thrifts, we had a solid quarter and an especially clean quarter. We continue to see an improvement in net interest income despite a decline in margin, some of which is a attributed to the recent acquisition which John will explaine in more detail. Our conservative approach, our attention to the fundamentals of taking care of clients, and the more favorable economic conditions of our markets are allowing us to appropriately navigate these difficult times. During the quarter, we passed the 2 billion milestone for total assets. While the second quarter is usually a commercial bank's softest growth quarter, in particular deposits, we exhibited solid organic loan and deposit growth during the quarter. Again, growth that is exclusive of the Acadiana combination. I'm particularly pleased with the diversity of our growth from both a segment and product perspective. And while we are only beginning the cross sell process with our new clients from the merger, the significant added convenience we bring to the Acadiana clients is already being tapped. This management team prides itself on our methodical approach to making investments and strategic decisions to enhance long-term shareholder value. As you listen to John and Michael this morning, I hope that you will be reminded of some of the decisions we're making that negatively impact near-term results, but that we believe are the right decisions for the long-term. The exceptional quality of our second quarter earnings is an example of our approach to decision-making. As anticipated, our ROE is all from our historical trend as a result of the recent combination with Acadiana Bancshares. Over time however, we expect to be back on track as the benefits of combination are fully reflected in the organization's earnings. The one area I mentioned in last quarter's call that I would again bring to your attention today is the difference that I believe exists between companies like ours who exclusively use purchase accounting compared to other companies who historically used pooling of interest treatment. While John will frame up this discussion in a minute, it is my opinion that we're competitively disadvantaged regarding our ROE relative to upper (ph) banks, simply because the accounting treatment used in our historical acquisitions. To level the playing field several high-quality banks have commenced reporting return on tangible equity. We believe the measure of the return on tangible equity will become a more focal point given the increasing combination and consolidation in our industry and the elimination of pooling of interest treatment. Accordingly, we become providing this ratio in our financial statements in addition to the traditional ROE. At this point I will turn the floor over to John for a discussion of our financial results. JOHN DAVIS - IBERIABANK Corporation - Senior Executive Vice President Thanks, Daryl. In a nutshell we showed very solid results for the second quarter, which is in contrast to the results exhibited by many other financial institutions. Our net interest income increased significantly. Our mortgage origination business had an incredible quarter. The net charge off ratio was the lowest in 10 quarters. We improved our efficiency. Capital remained very strong. And we reported record fully diluted EPS for the quarter. All extremely positive. As few items in our press release may on the surface require a more detailed explanation than we customarily provide in these calls in these items, namely, long growth margin, ROE and NPA levels may appear to be off trend. However, we will discuss very shortly we're not concerned in any way regarding our quarterly results for these items. So more on these in a minute. 3 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

JULY 23, 2003 / 1:30PM, IBKC - Q2 2003 IBERIABANK CORP Earnings Conference Call For the second quarter of 2003 we reported 85 cents per fully diluted share, up 2 cents from the first quarter of 2003, and beating average estimates by penny. Street estimates for the second quarter ranged from 83 cents to 85, with an average of 84 cents per share. The second quarter 2003 EPS results were up 14 percent compared to the second quarter of last year. The acquisition of Acadiana Bancshares on February 28th had a immaterial impact in EPS pretty much throughout the period. Therefore, EPS growth we are reporting are essentially apples to apples growth comparisons due to the limited impacts of the Acadiana acquisition and FAS 142. Current Street expectations for fully diluted EPS for the full year range from $3.38 per share per to $3.45 with an average of $3.41, up 10 cents from our prior conference calls. Next quarter analysts have us ranging from 85 cents to 87 cents with an average of 86 cents. We raised our earnings guidance in each of the last two conference calls and eliminated any previously anticipated onetime acquisition costs. During our last conference call we raised our comfort range to $3.32 to 342 per fully diluted share for 2003. Today we are raising the bottom end of our range by 5 cents per share to now be $3.37, up 5 cents. As a result we're narrowing the range from $3.37 to $3.42 per share for 2003. We're also confirming our expectation of double-digit EPS growth for 2004. So again at a time when many banks are waffling and lowering their estimates, we're firming up ours. Much of my discussion this morning will focus on the financial performance of the Company in the second quarter of 2003 compared to the first quarter of 2003. Some of the financial figures we reported today were impacted by the completion of our acquisition of Acadiana Bancshares on February 28. This acquisition was completed using the purchase accounting method, and as such the operations of Acadiana are included in our financial statements as of that date. Average balances and income statement figures include the full impact of the acquisition in the second quarter, but only one month of the impact in the first quarter of 2003. However, quarter end balance sheet comparisons between first and second quarter 2003 are both postacquisition comparisons. First, I will begin with loans. And so on the discussion of the balance sheet, we reported period end loan growth of $26 million or 2 percent between the ends of the first and second quarters of this year. We are on a linked quarter basis. While this may seem a little sluggish compared to our historical loan growth trends, the slower growth was primarily a result of a bulk sale of mortgage loans. After the Acadiana acquisition we noticed that what we considered to be unfavorable prepayment behavior emanating from a portion of the acquired mortgage portfolio. Early in the first quarter we decided to sell some of Acadiana's highest yielding and least seasoned conforming mortgages, ones that we considered most likely to refinance. The $27 million in loans we had sold had an underlying gross weighted average coupon, or WAC, in the mid 7 percent range, a weighted average maturity, or WAM, just shy of 20 years. And we suspect that these loans would potentially run fast. Upon completion of the loan sale on April 30th, we used the sale proceeds to pay down borrowings and fund subsequent loan growth. We reduced the loan premium recorded in association with the Acadiana acquisition by $1.2 million. We believe these loans were prepaying so rapidly that the economic gain outweighed the present value of the interest spread that we would have earned on the loans had the loans stayed with us. In simple terms, had the loans prepaid, we would have been forced to replace those loans at current rates. Had we sold the loans at a gain, we would have received a cash gain, but still would have been forced to replace those loans at current rates. So with those loans refinancing so rapidly, we're going to be forced to reinvest funds at current rates either way. The only difference is in the case where the loans were sold. We now have received a real cash gain. Essentially, we gave up near-term earnings for a higher economic benefit. The loan sale masked what we believe was otherwise a very strong -- otherwise very strong loan growth for the quarter. Excluding the bulk loan sale, total loans climbed 53 million during the quarter, up 4 percent or 16 percent annually between the end of the first quarter and end of the second quarter of 2003. On the same basis, mortgage and construction loans grew at a 33 percent annualized rate during the quarter. We also experienced exceptionally strong loan growth in home equity loans and lines, up 49 percent on an annualized basis, and indirect lending up 11 percent on an annualized basis. The average loan yield declined 32 basis points between the first and second quarters due to the Acadiana acquisition and general loan refinancing. On the deposit side, deposits grew 36 million or a little over 2 percent during the quarter, an annualized rate of about 10 percent. Growth was demonstrated nearly in all deposit categories and segments. Since the end of the quarter we have seen some recent weakness in CDs, but tremendous growth in transaction accounts. Overall, we're very pleased with the deposit growth that we exhibited. The average cost of interest bearing deposits declined 10 basis points between the first and second quarters. Keep in mind that Acadiana's deposit mix had an unfavorable impact on these figures, so without the acquisition the rate improvement may have been a little greater. 4 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

JULY 23, 2003 / 1:30PM, IBKC - Q2 2003 IBERIABANK CORP Earnings Conference Call Dealing now with investment portfolio and capital. Our $461 million bond portfolio grew by about 35 million or 8 percent during the quarter, as we tried to stay ahead of projected cash flows. The growth in the portfolio was primarily to prefund anticipated cash flows for the next two months. Like many banks, cash flows accelerated on us during the quarter resulting in the increased bond premium amortization of about $360,000 between the linked quarters, which lowered the yield on the portfolio by about 32 basis points and negatively impacted the margin by about 8 basis points. A few of the higher amortization bonds will burn out shortly, thus providing some relief in this regard. Over the last few quarters we have periodically sold what we considered to be misbehaving bonds, which lengthened the portfolio slightly and cost us a little bit in yield. The second quarter was no exception, in that we sold certain bonds towards the end of the quarter replacing those with 15 year collateral paper with very little extension risks. We believe that banks that don't pay attention to extension risk will ultimately be severely punished in a rising rate environment. We're not proponents of stretching for yield in the current rate environment. At the end of June the portfolio had a modified duration of 2.9 years compared to 2.4 years at the end of March and a yield of 3.74 percent compared to 3.92 percent over that same period. We had about $7 million in unrealized gains at the end of the quarter. And we only had about 5000 in net gain that were incurred during the quarter just reported. We completed our second $10 million issuance of trust preferred securities, this time at the end of the second quarter. We issued it at 315 basis points over three month LIBOR, swap to yield 588 for five years. We paid no origination or annual trustees in association with the issuance of these securities. We believe our timing was fortuitous both from the perspective of the issuance and the swap. Our supplemental share repurchase program which is tied to the First Trust preferred offering is still active. During the second quarter we purchased 40,800 shares at an average cost of $45.34 per share. So in aggregate we purchase a total of 87,100 shares at an average cost of $41.56 per share out of an authorized program of 60 to 130,000 shares. Average equity ballooned $30 million or 19 percent on a linked quarter basis. You may recall that in the days when pooling of interest accounting treatment was used the acquired entity's equity was recorded at its book value, which for most banks trading at a premium, this can be relatively low figure. In contrast under purchased accounting, equity is coming over market value which is usually much higher than book value. So for book purposes, returned on book equity is harder to come under purchased versus pooling. For regulatory purposes, intangibles offset a significant portion of equity -- of the equity base in such a manner that regulatory capital doesn't increase like book equity does. Therefore, the use of purchased accounting treatment in our Acadiana acquisition eased our regulatory capital, but substantially raised our book equity, thus having a dampening effect on our return on book equity, which is really the standardized ROE measure. We believe a more accurate measure that levels the playing field between pooling of interest treatment, which is no longer usable, and purchased accounting treatment, which is the only method that can used going forward, is to use return on average tangible equity. A handful of other banks are using this measure or one similar to return on average tangible equity, including more active acquirers probably because they became aware of this issue fairly early. We suspect it will become more meaningful in the years ahead as the industry continues to consolidate, and the purchased accounting method is the only method that can be used. Our period end equity to assets ratio declined from 8.89 percent at year end 2002 to 9.22 percent at the end of March, which was after our acquisition. It edged up again to about 9.30 percent at the end of June. Our ROE went from 1329 in the fourth quarter of 2002 to 1356 in the first quarter to 12.88 in the second quarter. Our return on tangible equity ratios went from 1783 in the fourth quarter to 1920 in the first quarter to 2050 in the second quarter. We raised our quarterly dividend by 10 percent in mid-June, equal to a 22 percent increase over the same quarter last year. Despite the regular dividend increases we've made over the last few years our rapidly growing earnings and commensurate share price movement have actually caused our dividend yield and pay out ratios to decline consistently over the last few years. I hate to say it, but it is kind of a nice problem to have. I constantly remind people that they may be remiss if they focus solely on companies that raise their dividends without considering which companies have the greatest capacity to increase their dividends now and in the future. Regarding operating performance, our ROE in the second quarter eased back slightly from 1.24 or in the first quarter to 1.21 in the second. Tax equivalent revenues as defined by tax equivalent net interest income plus tax equivalent noninterest income increased 11 percent compared to 5 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

JULY 23, 2003 / 1:30PM, IBKC - Q2 2003 IBERIABANK CORP Earnings Conference Call the first quarter and up 17 percent compared to the same quarter last year. Similarly, tax equivalent net interest income climbed 7 percent on a linked quarter basis and up 16 percent on a second to second basis. Despite this strong growth in revenues, the margin slipped 30 basis points on a linked quarter basis. The margin compression during the quarter was primarily driven by accelerated bond premium amortization described earlier of about 8 basis points. And the remainder was due to the Acadiana acquisition balance sheet mix and mark-to-market adjustment. We do not believe the recent rate reduction by the Federal Reserve will have any maturely impact on our financial performance due to improved liability pricing. We remained fairly well balanced, but I would state that each rate reduction becomes progressively more challenging to offset. We are very fortunate to operate in markets that continue to experience favorable economic conditions, particularly on a relative basis. So in summary, while our margin declined during the quarter, we sold some high yielding assets which (inaudible) substantially higher tax equivalent net interest income, and our capital ratios remained very strong. In addition, we did not undertake undue credit or interest rate risk to accomplish this improved income. Our company was not significantly affected by changes in interest rates. The recent interest rate sensitivity modeling that we have done indicates a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would increase our net interest income over a twelve-month period by about 5 percent. Similarly, a 100 basis point decrease would decrease our net interest income by about 2.5 percent. Mortgage production jumped 68 percent between the first and second quarters of 2003, from 74 million in the first quarter to 123 million in the second quarter. We continue to sell the majority of our fixed mortgage production into the secondary markets. However, we tend to retain mortgages of private banking clients and selected others. Most of our retained mortgages are 10 year, 15 year jumbo and ARM paper. Mortgage related income was 1.1 million, up 61 percent compared to that prior record results in the first quarter of 2003. Our current pipeline is at a record level of $92 million. So we are optimistic about the third quarter as well. We recorded a gain on the sale of an excess bank property during the quarter totaling $89,000, which was essentially offset by a few expenses such as $53,000 increase in ESOP expenses that resulted from the 20 percent increase in our stock price during the quarter. Nearly all of the other improvement in noninterest income was the result of the Acadiana acquisition and improved fee structures changes that were implemented in early March of this year. Noninterest expense grew 9.8 percent during the second quarter compared to the first quarter of 2003. Mortgage related commission expense increased 138,000 or 79 percent during the quarter as production volume expanded. Additional temp and overtime expense was incurred associated with the Acadiana systems conversion completed in March 29th. Congratulations are in order to George Becker and all the people involved from both Acadiana and IBERIABANK in completion of an outstanding conversion, probably the most flawless conversion I'm ever seen. During the quarter we incurred moving costs and additional technology infrastructure costs as those improvements continued to come online. These enhancements will significant enhance our client service quality and speed. Our tax equivalent tangible efficiency ratio continued to improve over the last four quarters from 55.3 percent to 54.8 to 54 to 52.8 percent prospectively. We remain comfortable with our target of 50 percent. Non-performing assets increased 1.3 million during the quarter to $7.5 million. As a percentage of assets, NPAs edged up from 31 basis points to 37 basis points. While on the service these results may seem to be off trend, our aggressive portfolio management style will occasionally cause this to happen. We are very well secured on these handful of credits and do not anticipate any material losses associated with the credits. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans dropped to 38 basis points in the first quarter to 25 basis points in the second, our lowest level in 10 quarters. The provision remained strong at 1.6 million, unchanged on a link quarter basis. And the reserve climbed from 1.23 percent at the end of March to 1.26 at the end of June. Overall, we feel very good about our credit quality position. And Michael will provide more detail on the outstanding asset quality results in just a minute. For the bottom line, we reported record quarterly earnings of $6 million, a record, up 15 percent on a linked quarter basis and up 29 percent second to second. We reported fully diluted EPS of 85 cents in the second quarter of 2003, a record, up 3 percent on a linked quarter basis and up 14 percent 6 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

JULY 23, 2003 / 1:30PM, IBKC - Q2 2003 IBERIABANK CORP Earnings Conference Call compared to one year ago. Our stock price has held up well since our last conference call. Since our last call, our stock price rose 27 percent from 39.87 to $51.60 currently after being essentially flat during the first quarter of 2003. The challenging interest rate environment has really tested many bank and thrift management teams. We are very proud of the record results for the quarter and the first half of 2003. And we will continue to work hard to deliver exceptional performance. We're conservative, methodical and patient, yet opportunistic and nimble. We are uniquely positioned in Louisiana, a state that is performing relatively well compared to many others. We believe our competitors are distracted elsewhere, while we remain very focused. We're strong believers in building shareholder value while others simply pay it lip service. We appreciate your continued support as we seek to build an exceptional franchise for the present and the future. I will now turn it over to Mike who will provide some comments regarding the credit side. MICHAEL BROWN - IBERIABANK Corporation - Chief Credit Officer and President Thanks, John. As with previous presentations, I'm going to give you a sense for the bank's credit profile as of the end of the second quarter, and give an update on changes in the loan mix. As to discuss results, the first and second quarter numbers include the impact of our LBA acquisition, the 123102 in earlier numbers do not. Before I get started the credit discussion, I want to provide an update on the Louisiana economy. I will begin with a positive note in that the state debt rating was recently upgraded. The upgrade was a function of the state's improved fiscal position combined with continue conservative budget and that management practices. This positive news about the state obviously runs counter to many of the recent articles about other states' financial positions. As with the national economy, Louisiana has seen an increase in unemployment levels recently. For the state as a whole, unemployment levels increased to 6.3 percent as of the end of May, which was in line with the national unemployment level of 6.4. As we have discussed previously, there tends to be higher unemployment levels in the state's rural markets, where IBERIABANK has no focused. For the bank's main markets the unemployment level was better than both the national and state levels. Placia (ph) Parish's May unemployment level was very strong at 4 percent, which improved from the beginning of the year. New Orleans and Monroe also showed improvement since the beginning of year, reporting unemployment levels of 5.1 and 5.4 percent respectively. Within the individual IBERIABANK markets, Lafayette continues to see growth in residential construction activity and retail sales. Although commercial construction has slowed from the first quarter, it still remains at a brisk pace. As evidenced by the employment levels, the New Orleans economy is performing favorably despite the negative impact from a slowdown in travel and convention business, which has hurt hotel occupancy levels. For Monroe, which tends to be a very stable economy, local economists are projecting an improving economic situation with the recent improvement in unemployment levels. Of interest, despite high natural gas prices the state has not yet seen an increase in oil and grass drilling activity. Although Louisiana is one of the nation's largest producers of natural gas with 25 percent of the nation's capacity, the Louisiana rig count as of the end of June was 154 rigs, which was down from 167 rigs at the beginning of the year. The lack of activity and significantly lower levels of gas storage ensure that gas prices will not likely decline in the future. Although activity has not increased, the impact of prices through well ownership and royalty interest programs is beneficial to both the state and its citizens. Now for the credit update. I will begin with a discussion of non-performing assets. As John mentioned, NPAs which we define as non-accrual, OREO, and loans 90 plus days due, but still accruing, increased during the second quarter to 7.5 million, or 37 basis points of total assets. This compared to 31 at the end of the first quarter (inaudible) 42 basis points as of the end of last year, and 60 basis points at the end of 2002 second quarter. The increase during the quarter totaled approximately 1.3 million. Despite the peer to peer increase, IBERIABANK's NPA level remains that of peers and well below the bank's historical levels. NPAs at the end of the quarter were broken down as follows. Our non-accrual loans were 3.8 million. This represents an increase of about 400,000 from the end of the first quarter. All of the increase is due to a single commercial loan that had been on the bank's watchlist for some time due to some very recent deterioration in performance of (inaudible) that put the loan on non-accrual. I'll not that the loan is secured by well margin investment real estate, and we do not expect a loss. 7 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

JULY 23, 2003 / 1:30PM, IBKC - Q2 2003 IBERIABANK CORP Earnings Conference Call For OREO and foreclosed assets that ended the quarter at 2.1 million. This was unchanged from the end of the first quarter. About 85 percent of Oreos are still the motel we have discussed previously. On a very positive note, we recently put the motel into contract. The sales price is for the current carrying amount of the property. As we are early in the process it is possible that the sale might not be completed, but we obviously view the agreement to sell the motel as a very positive development. If all goes as planned, the sell of property is likely to be completed by the end of the third quarter. On a side note, the property's performance has continued to improve throughout this year and is operating at a cash flow positive level year-to-date. For 90 plus days past due but still accruing, that ended the quarter at 1.5 million. This represented and $970,000 increase over the end of the first quarter, and about a $450,000 increase over the end of last year. This increase was due primarily to a higher level of past dues in both commercial and mortgage. In both cases the increase, which was almost evenly split between the two loan categories, was due to a limited number of loans. We do not believe that this increase represents a portfolio wide issue, but rather a continuation of the bank's proactive efforts to deal with portfolio management issues in a straightforward and timely fashion. The bank is not expect meaningful losses in either category. For example, over 60 percent of the commercial dollars over 90 days is secured by cash or cash equivalents. In the case of the commercial loans, all had previously been identified through our portfolio management activities as having issues and were being managed by the bank's special assets area. Relative to the increase in mortgage past dues, I will note that the bank has historically had very limited losses from the mortgage portfolio. To aid with your comparison to our peer banks, NPAs without consideration of the over 90, but still accruing past dues, would have been 5.9 million or 29 basis points total assets. Non-performing loans, which are NPAs without consideration of Oreos, totaled 5.4 million or 27 basis points of total assets. So very good levels. Net charge-offs for the second quarter were $835,000 or 25 basis points of average loans. This is the lowest level for charge-offs in over two years. The charge-off levels were down from 1.1 million or 38 basis points in the first quarter and down significantly from 1.5 million or 63 basis points in the same quarter of 2002. Full year charge-offs for 2002 were 40 basis points. And annualizing the charge-offs for the first six months of this year were 31 basis points. Despite the decline in charge-offs the bank maintained its provision at 1.6 million, the same level as the first quarter of 2003. The provision covered the quarter's net charge-off of 1.9 times. With the access provision the allowance increased by about 700,000 during the quarter. The loan loss allowance ended the quarter at 16.8 million, or 1.26 percent of loans, which compared to 16.1 million or 1.23 percent of loans at the end of the first quarter. As of June 30th, the loan loss allowance covered fully loaded non-performing assets 2.3 times, which was down from 2.6 times at the end of the first quarter, but up from 2 times at the end of last year. The allowance covered non-performing loans 3 times at quarter end. Finally, the reserve covered annualized second quarter net charge-offs 5 times, which was intimately higher than the first quarter level in that year-end. The consolidated loan portfolio ended the quarter a little over 1.3 billion. And as John discussed earlier, loans were reduced during the quarter by approximately 27 million as the bank sold mortgages, but due to their high coupons were very vulnerable to refinancing and prepayment risk. Adjusting for this loan sale, loans grew 16 percent on an annualized basis during the quarter. As I will discuss in the next few minutes, loan growth came from old loan categories, which is consistent with our stated goal to maintain a balanced loan portfolio. Relative to past dues for the consolidated loan portfolio, loans 30 plus days past due, and that includes non-accruals, ended the quarter at 91 basis points, which was up from 66 at the end of the first quarter, but in line with the level at year-end. As noted earlier, the increase in past dues was primarily tied to a limited number of loans in commercial and mortgage. In an attempt to give you a little more insight into the loan portfolio, I am going to review the performance of each of the lan segments. I'm going to start with commercial, which includes our business banking portfolio. The commercial loan portfolio ended the quarter at 519 million. Commercial loans represent 39 percent of the overall loan portfolio as of June 30th, which was basically unchanged from the end of the first quarter and the year-end. Without consideration of LBA, annualized commercial portfolio growth for this first six months of the year was approximately 17 percent. 8 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

JULY 23, 2003 / 1:30PM, IBKC - Q2 2003 IBERIABANK CORP Earnings Conference Call Annualized commercial loan growth for the second quarter was at a lower-level of around 6 percent. But the bank had a very healthy pipeline moving into the third quarter. I would note that the second quarter loan growth was impacted by the bank's proactive portfolio management approach, which reduced commercial outstanding by approximately 7 million in loans that no longer met the bank's lending criteria. I want to emphasize that the commercial portfolio does not include the bank's private banking mortgage product which saw particularly strong growth during the second quarter. Private banking mortgages are reflected in the mortgage loan portfolio, which I will talk about in a couple minutes. If the private banking mortgages were considered in commercial, annualized commercial growth would have been 26 percent for the second quarter and 36 percent for the first six months of the year. As noted in previous conference calls the bank has made a strong commitment to developing private banking in both Lafayette and Orleans. This commitment has produced 57 percent growth in private banking loans in the first six months of year and 46 percent growth in private banking deposits. We fee comfortable that this segment will continue to have good growth prospects for the future. Relative to past dues which include non-accruals, the bank reported 30 days past due for the commercial portfolio at 64 basis points, which is an increase over a very strong level of 28 basis points at the end of the first quarter. The majority of the increase in the past dues was tied to portfolio management clean up activities related to the acquired LBA loan portfolio, and the increase in nonaccruals discussed earlier. Despite the increase in commercial past dues, this level of past dues is actually in line with historical levels for our Company. Annualized net charge-offs for the quarter for commercial were 24 basis points of average loans, which was down from 36 in the first quarter and down from 33 for 2002. Net charge-offs were an annualized level of about 30 basis points for the first six months of year. Commercial watchlist ended the quarter at 19 million, which was up from 14 at the end of the first quarter. The watchlist increased in size as a result of the addition of several credits, which were identified though the bank's normal portfolio management process. The majority of this increase was in the least severe watchlist category. Although higher in dollar terms, the watchlist still represented less than 4 percent of the commercial loan portfolio. For indirect, the indirect loan portfolio continued to grow during the second quarter. Indirect loans ended the quarter at 234 million or 18 percent of the overall loan portfolio. Annualized indirect growth for the quarter was 11 percent, which represented a slower pace than the first quarter. Annualized growth for the first six months of the year was around 14 percent. Although still a very competitive business, IBERIABANK remains very focused on high quality borrows. I will note that the average credit score for the second quarter was 731, which was consistent with the bank's average for the first quarter. Past dues at the end of the quarter were 1.3 percent, which was up very modestly from the end of the first quarter, but down from year-end levels. Annualized net charge-offs for the indirect portfolio continued to improve. Annualized net charge-offs were 50 basis points in the second quarter, which represented an improvement over 55 in the first quarter and 74 for 2002. We feel that this charge-off improvement is a reflection of continued economic strength in the Acadiana region, along with a number of underwriting changes that were made 18 to 24 months ago. The direct consumer portfolio, and that includes credit cards, direct order, home equity lines and loans ended the quarter at 236 million. Annualized growth during the quarter was a strong 25 percent. Growth came from the bank's traditional home equity primarily, which tend to be strong in the second quarter of the year. Despite the growth level evidenced in the quarter, the bank did not sacrifice its credit standards to achieve it. The average credit score for home equity production during the second quarter was 735 and the average loan to value was 68 percent. Past dues at the end of the second quarter were 1.44 percent which is comparable with the end of the first quarter and a significant improvement over the past due levels at the end of 2002. Annualized net charge-offs for the consumer portfolio for the second quarter were 42 basis point, which was down significantly from 72 basis points for the first quarter and 75 for 2002. Finally, mortgage. Mortgage loans ended the quarter at 344 million or 26 percent of total loans. I have noted earlier the bank sold a portion of the portfolio, which was refinancing and in turn paying off very quickly. This gap was filled primarily with private banking mortgages originating during the quarter. Adjusting for the mortgages sold during the quarter, annualized growth, as John mentioned, for the portfolio was a very strong 33 percent. 9 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

JULY 23, 2003 / 1:30PM, IBKC - Q2 2003 IBERIABANK CORP Earnings Conference Call Mortgage past dues ended the quarter at 67 basis points which was up from 37 at the end of the first quarter. Although past dues increased, the majority of the increase was due to a limited number of loans. During the second quarter the bank reported a net recovery for the mortgage portfolio. In summary, I would like to draw the following conclusions on the credit side. One, the bank continued to enjoy good diversified loan growth during the quarter. As we have discussed previously, we were not dependent on only one loan segment to grow the portfolio. Two, the bank's private banking strategy is paying significant dividends due to good loan growth as well as deposit growth. The bank continues to expand its product (inaudible) abilities in order to meet a broader array of private banking client needs. Three, although NPAs and past dues increased during the quarter, the increase was tied to a limited number of loans that are likely to have limited risk of loss. Even with the increase in NPAs the bank NPA level remains below that of peer institutions and well below the bank's historical levels. Four, despite reporting a significant decline in charge-offs, IBERIABANK continues to increase its allowance. The allowance covered annualized second quarter net charge-offs over 5 times. And then finally, the bank's major markets are performing solidly from an economic perspective even without any help from a pickup in natural gas activity which has a favorable outlook. I will now turn the presentation over to Daryl. DARYL BYRD - IBERIABANK Corporation - President and CEO Michael, thanks. Again, I'm pleased with the strong quarter just completed. We're confident in the progress we've made and where we are today with excellent asset quality, solid deposit and loan growth and improved EPS. The net interest margin declined as we expected due to the recent acquisition. But also as expected net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis grew significantly. We are also optimistic that the potential sale of the motel Michael discussed will be finalized. Addressing the hotel, it is has taken a lot of effort, but we have worked through the collection process, focused on rehabilitating the property and returning it to commerce. The sale agreement reinforces our success with this progress -- with this process. We believe our focus on internal organic growth, supplemented with acquisition opportunities, will continue to deliver favorable results for our shareholders. As I mentioned earlier, we are pleased to be operating in excellent markets with tremendous expansion opportunities that give what we believe to be a competitive advantage. While we are pleased with our progress for the first six months of year, continuous improvement is always our focus. Cynthia, we will now open the floor for questioning. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Operator (CALLER INSTRUCTIONS) James Abbott from FBR. James Abbott - FBR - Analysts I wanted to ask a couple of questions on the -- one is the margin. The margin had an effect of 8 basis point I think it was in the press release due to premium amortization increase. I was wondering if you have the numbers for the total premium amortization and/or the total that remains I guess anyway? And then some color on what effect the substantial drop in mortgage rate in June would have on the third quarter? 10 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

JULY 23, 2003 / 1:30PM, IBKC - Q2 2003 IBERIABANK CORP Earnings Conference Call JOHN DAVIS - IBERIABANK Corporation - Senior Executive Vice President Dave, this is John Davis. The premium amortization increased by 360,000, but we're not disclosing the elements of exactly what the bond premium amortization was in each of the quarters. As far as our expectation, we did have some bonds are very short in nature that did have accelerated premium amortization that we said would kind of burn out in a very short period of time. So we do expect some relief in that respect. The drop in mortgage rates that happened recently certainly has helped our mortgage origination business which is doing exceptionally well. However, one of the things that I think is fairly unique about us, I think most of (inaudible) that we have seen is most folk's pipelines generally run about 75 percent or so refi. Ours is only about 46 percent refi. So our mortgage business has quite a bit of purchase and construction lending involved in it and is doing exceptionally well in that respect. So maybe we will see a little less of the pinch than maybe some others who are more reliant on the refi business. On the bond side, we do have quite a few bonds that are mortgage related. They tend to be fairly short. But I would remind you that given our current circumstances, we have quite a bit of cash flows that are still anticipated to come forward for the next 12 months. The last numbers we saw I think were about 140 million in cash flows over the next twelve months. That, with the backup in rates that has happened recently, we don't expect any significant diminution in that cash flow production, therefore, providing us some opportunities to kind of reinvest. My personal opinion is I think you will see some natural hedge between our short bond portfolio and the mortgage origination side. But again we're less affected on the refi than probably most. I hope that answers your question, James. James Abbott - FBR - Analysts No, I think that helps a lot. I appreciate that. I guess maybe to ask it a little bit of a different way is, would you expect an increase in additions? Like it was 360 this quarter, is it 400 next quarter and then it drops off? COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE John needs to be careful because we don't project margin going forward. JOHN DAVIS - IBERIABANK Corporation - Senior Executive Vice President Yes, we don't. But again, James, coming back to the bond issue, that 360,000 was an increase in the premium amortization. James Abbott - FBR - Analysts Right that is what I was wondering. (multiple speakers) JOHN DAVIS - IBERIABANK Corporation - Senior Executive Vice President On an absolute level. So your question is, would we have an increasing amount thereafter? We're not going to talk through that, but again I would suggest that we would see some relief with some of the bonds that are going to burnout. You really can't tell each individual instrument is going to behave very differently. And we don't know what the spikes that you may have seen recently as rates have backed up, people kind of racing to get their refis in, what impact that might have. So it is really kind of premature for us to be able to even speculate where that's going to go. James Abbott - FBR - Analysts Okay, thanks. A quick follow-up and then I will jump off and let others ask. The expenses were up a little over $1.1 million. And based on my calculations, it looks like roughly 80 percent of that was Acadiana expenses based on the information in the press release. Could you talk about 11 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

JULY 23, 2003 / 1:30PM, IBKC - Q2 2003 IBERIABANK CORP Earnings Conference Call how much of that was temporary expenses due to conversions, if you can break that out -- that 800,$900,000? How much of that was temporary? How much you expect to go away? And then maybe if you could give us a feel for what you see as a runrate on the expenses once some of these things normalize? James, our policy really isn't to provide the forward-looking element that you have described. I would suggest we have incurred various merger related expenses, be it moving, temp expense, whatever that might be, over the last few quarters. And we have not historically broken that out. I would just suggest that our record results do incorporate those costs. And that over time we are extracting the savings that we expected from the merger as we outlined. Operator Peyton Green from FTN Midwest Research. Peyton Green - FTN Midwest Research - Analysts A couple of quick questions. Michael, what was the direct consumer -- I believe the actual growth in the second quarter? MICHAEL BROWN - IBERIABANK Corporation - Chief Credit Officer and President The actual growth level -- bear with me a second and I will give it go you. And again I am giving you a total for consumer, which includes a number of categories. For the three months it was about 6.3 percent. Peyton Green - FTN Midwest Research - Analysts Okay. MICHAEL BROWN - IBERIABANK Corporation - Chief Credit Officer and President And then within that, obviously as John noted, there was a significantly higher growth level from home equity lines and loans and from the other consumer categories. Peyton Green - FTN Midwest Research - Analysts Okay, and then... DARYL BYRD - IBERIABANK Corporation - President and CEO Peyton, clearly we continue to feel very good about loan growth. Peyton Green - FTN Midwest Research - Analysts Sure. And then with respect to the watchlist have you all seen any change in the number of customers that have weaker classifications versus 90 days or 180 days ago because of weaker financial statements? I mean do you expect that to change the charge-off level going forward? Or do you feel really comfortable about how you have reunderwritten? 12 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

JULY 23, 2003 / 1:30PM, IBKC - Q2 2003 IBERIABANK CORP Earnings Conference Call COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE You know, that is an interesting question. Obviously, a fair part of the second piece is projection oriented. What we are seeing is what we would kind of expect. We're always tinkering with the loan portfolio in the search of perfection. So I mean, we're always going to have loans going onto the watchlist and coming off. What we're seeing is not out of line with what we would expect to see at this particular juncture. Peyton Green - FTN Midwest Research - Analysts Okay. DARYL BYRD - IBERIABANK Corporation - President and CEO Peyton, also, this is Daryl, I think you have to be careful, as Michael reported in his time, we had some backup in past dues. But I think you have to think about that kind of correctly in that in the first quarter if you looked at our past dues, we probably hit the ball out of the park over the scoreboard. In the second quarter I would say we probably just hit the scoreboard and knocked the lights out. We got pretty good numbers. And as Michael says, we're always tinkering proactively with that portfolio and trying to make sure we're doing the right things. Peyton Green - FTN Midwest Research - Analysts Okay, and was there any Oreo expense in the quarter? COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE That is really not material. Operator Frank Barcosi (ph) with Keith (ph) Managers. Frank Barcosi - Keith Managers - Analysts Could you tell me what the net interest margin was for the month of June as it compared to the 390 average for the quarter? And also, now that you've had Acadiana in for over quarter or so, have you been able to affect any changes in their liability mix and their loan mix that would over coming quarters help their margins relative to that of the legacy IBERIABANK? COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE Frank, I'm going to start, and then I will get John to kind of jump in, and again remind you that, as I said in my comments, it is certainly still early. From a loan mix perspective we talked about the sale of the mortgage loans, that would certainly have some impact. From a deposit perspective, I think what I am most excited about, and it is what we anticipated all along, is our ability to tap their clients for additional products, remembering that theirs was mostly a CD base. And from a convenience perspective we dramatically improved the convenience to those clients. And we're seeing them in other parts of the market where historically Acadiana didn't have branches. So we feel pretty good about what we are able to do in terms of tapping that client franchise. But again, and I'm going to let John jump in now, it is still very early in the process. 13 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

JULY 23, 2003 / 1:30PM, IBKC - Q2 2003 IBERIABANK CORP Earnings Conference Call JOHN DAVIS - IBERIABANK Corporation - Senior Executive Vice President Frank, I will comment first on the margin. As we have always done we don't comment on the margin going forward. And obviously June might give people a jumping off point as far as expectations for the third quarter. So I would -- unfortunately, I have to hesitate in providing that information. We did feel good about the margin in general. I would remind you that, again, the way purchase accounting works, it is going to have a material impact on the margin just because what we've done is essentially taken the bond portfolio and marked it to current market. And going back to February 28th when we did the Acadiana transaction, that meant the bond portfolio was marked to current yields at that stage, which obviously were relatively low. The same applies to the loan portfolio where they are marked down. Coming back to you question on the mix changes, we did sell some of the securities that were in the Acadiana portfolio. Again, they were mark-to-market so they are really going to move into market anyway. And on the loan side we did sell some of the loans, which were some of their higher yielding, but given the prepayment speeds that they were exhibiting, we just felt like these things were going to run so far, so fast, that the economic value -- the economic gain was more important than near-term income. So we naturally have made some of those changes as we have sold some of those loans and bonds in that process. On the deposit side, deposits generally have held up fairly well. As I mentioned earlier, we have seen some recent diminution in the CD side. I wouldn't say it is extreme by any stretch of the imagination. Whether that was Acadiana driven or IBERIABANK driven, I really couldn't tell you. And some of that is legacy deposit that we have had for sometime that really hadn't gone through a refinancing of sorts, and the dramatically lower rates we are experiencing now. The longer-term advances, you may recall, Acadiana has 5, 6, 7 year advances, some of them bank advances. We marked those to market and they came down a lot. But we basically kept most of those. We've thought those were very favorably priced at current yields. So again, coming back to your question of the mix, we have made some mix changes in that respect, but I would suggest we are also working that portfolio and adding and improving the mix in the Acadiana market with the additional distribution points, and the people that we have, and the clients that we now have. So as Daryl described, it is going to take a little while to make all that happen, but it is happening, and it is happening methodically, which is really the approach we take in just about everything we do. So again, we have sold stuff but we have replaced it with current production that we feel good about. So some yield or earnings compression due to that, but that is naturally going to happen, and as rates change, we will take advantage of it accordingly. Frank Barcosi - Keith Managers - Analysts Great. Just one quick follow-up question. Could you give us a flavor as to how you view the M&A climate in your marketplace over the balance of the year? Do you see a pickup in activity overall? Do you see a pricing consideration still a limiting factor in more activity? What is your read? COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE Frank, I will give you a personal opinion and it is worth absolutely nothing, but I will give it. I do think that all banks and thrifts are feeling margin compression. I just think that is natural. It is an industrywide phenomenon. And as such, I think you've got some management teams and boards that are looking at their circumstances and realizing that, you know, the days of a very steep yield curve and some things that existed before, made it much easier operating environment than what we face now. And as such, the margin pressures and the general banking environment is much more complicated, and if we did experience a rise in rate, a fairly rapid rise in rate, I think some folks are going to be disappointed in some of the assets they put on their books. So I think there is probably more interest in general and it is not just related to Louisiana. It is probably nationwide where I think you've got some folks kind of rethinking the challenges of operating a bank or thrift in this environment. Louisiana in particular, you know we have gone through various areas acquisition waves.. I would suggest that Louisiana probably has less particularly publicly traded bank holding companies than probably most states. We don't have a lot here in that respect; we've got a lot private. Also, going back a few years, we had about a third of the financial institutions fail in the state, so there has already been a lot of consolidation that had taken place over time. So I think I would suggest you may see 14 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved. Republication or redistribution of Thomson Reuters content, including by framing or similar means, is prohibited without the prior written consent of Thomson Reuters.

JULY 23, 2003 / 1:30PM, IBKC - Q2 2003 IBERIABANK CORP Earnings Conference Call actually less M&A activity in Louisiana than you may see in other places. But I do think that you know folks really need to kind of look at their circumstances and recognize where they are and strategically where they are going. Frank, I would add to John's comments. We would see ourselves as pretty well positioned based on our methodical management and feel pretty good about Rstad (ph) as a potential acquirer, but I would also come back and remind everyone that we are also extremely focused on organic growth. You know like the kind of growth we exhibited in this last quarter. So we focus there first as always. Operator Steve Covington from Stifel, Nicolaus & Company. Steve Covington - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company - Analysts A couple of quick questions. First is a follow-up to I think Frank's question regarding deposits. And I'm just curious as to general philosophy on deposit pricing right now. Are you typically at the higher end relative to your competitors? Or how do you look at overall deposit pricing right now? COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE Steve, I would give you kind of a quick overview. Each of the market is going to be very different in its deposit pricing. And I would suggest... COMPANY SPEAKER And frankly we do that intentionally. COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE I think each of the markets in general in Louisiana are very different in how they behave from a deposit pricing perspective given competitive situations and others. But I think if you look at deposit rates in Louisiana in the markets we operate in and the ones we're not in, generally speaking, I would suspect it is probably lower deposit costs in our markets than in most other markets. That is just a feel in that respect and from what I've seen. And I could be wrong, but that is just kind of the impression I've got. I think that is really a function of the competitive environment that we face and the fact that, again, we have a third of the financial institutions taken out. So it's kind of different operating environment. Also, just a reminder that as Michael described with the economic situation, I mean we're running 4 percent unemployment in Lafayette Parish. We've got very strong economic conditions here. And we didn't go through the boom and bust of the technology and the .coms and all of that. So again, Louisiana kind of behaves a little differently than I think much of the national economy. And we are very fortunate in that respect to be in some very good markets. As far as our pricing, we have historically said that for our philosophy and the way we operate is that we believe our people are what drives the relationships, not the pricing of the products. We believe that people do in fact choose a relationship and prefer that. So we're not going to pay the top in the markets and we don't feel that is necessary to do that. We believe it is our people that really make the difference that we really work on servicing and differentiation in that respect, and the agility that we have in our decision-making and the local decision-making that that is really what drives people to decide where they want to place their deposits and where they want to take their loans. So again, we're not going to be top of the market. We're probably not going to be bottom of the market either. We'll probably somewhere in between. And again, each of the markets may be a little different in that respect. 15 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

JULY 23, 2003 / 1:30PM, IBKC - Q2 2003 IBERIABANK CORP Earnings Conference Call DARYL BYRD - IBERIABANK Corporation - President and CEO Steve, the word I would add to what John said is, we want to be very disciplined from a liability pricing perspective. And we do price each market separately, which is something we don't see some of our competitors doing, which we're kind of amazed at. But we think you have to be very disciplined from a liability pricing perspective. COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE Steve, I want to go back to a comment John said about relationships and relationships selling, which is really kind of a mantra for our private banking strategy. And as I mentioned earlier, we have seen extraordinarily good growth in deposits that has matched our growth in the loan business for that particular product segment. I think that what you find is that is really driven more by the individual contact rather than the pricing of the deposit. Steve Covington - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company - Analysts That's great, guys, thanks. And secondly, obviously the private banking growth has been astounding, but I was just curious if you give us just a general idea as to, number one, the characteristics of the construction, residential construction loan growth you are seeing? Is it end market? Are they generally large properties? And then secondly, the residential mortgage private banking area, are those also -- are those typically -- are those all end market, or will you do some second homes in Florida, for example, and things like that? Just to get an idea of how the loan portfolio may be changing? COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE Really, the focus here for us as an institution is on Louisiana. We have made that clear from conversations before. And we will lend to individuals who are here in Louisiana. Now occasionally we will go out-of-state with them to second homes as you describe it. But as a general rule, most of the growth that we're seeing, the vast majority of the growth we're seeing on the private banking mortgage side is existing homes, some new construction, very limited number of second homes out-of-state, the balance is all in Louisiana, all very straightforward types of credits with strong borrowers. Which is really what our focus is to develop a relationship with these individuals who tend to be higher net worth, professionals, executives, entrepreneurs who we can then expand the relationship with. And that is what is so exciting about the deposit growth, because that is really the natural extension of the relationship expansion, as well as into other products sets like investments. DARYL BYRD - IBERIABANK Corporation - President and CEO Steven, and you know this from historical comments we've made in our conference calls, if we are going to mess up we want to mess up in our own backyard. And you are not going to see us out of market. We're just not interested in doing something like that. Operator James Abbott with FDR. James Abbott - FBR - Analysts One other quick follow-up question. That loan sales, the $27 million, was that earlier on in the quarter or later on in the quarter? 16 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

JULY 23, 2003 / 1:30PM, IBKC - Q2 2003 IBERIABANK CORP Earnings Conference Call COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE I'm going from memory here, James. I think it would end of April -- April 29th I believe. James Abbott - FBR - Analysts And so the proceeds would have been rolled into maybe securities or how would you... COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE Yes, immediately it was used to pay down borrowings (inaudible) borrowings. Obviously, there's some spread compression that takes place, but again we had strong originations during the quarter -- loan originations, so you can to some extent see it as being funding that growth. James Abbott - FBR - Analysts I know you went from mid 7 percent yielding assets then... COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE Now keep in mind the underlying collateral is generally about mid 7 percent range. The yields may actually be less than that because of the purchase accounting adjustment. James Abbott - FBR - Analysts Right, that is a good point. Also on the purchasing accounting issue, was it a net negative or a net positive mark-to-market for Acadiana? COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE When you say negative or positive in what respect? James Abbott - FBR - Analysts I'm sorry, marking all the assets and liabilities. I was just wondering because they had a 6 to 8 year duration borrowings, which would have been a negative, if I understand the accounting rules correctly? COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE Okay. Well, I can suggest is take a look at the SEC filings because I think that the only place where we really disclosed estimated marks. So that is -- I would have to pass you to that. Operator Please go ahead. 17 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

JULY 23, 2003 / 1:30PM, IBKC - Q2 2003 IBERIABANK CORP Earnings Conference Call James Abbott - FBR - Analysts If you all feel very comfortable about the initially targeted cost savings on the Acadiana consolidation and that that will be in place by year end, does that suggest that your total non-interest expense will trend lower over the next two quarters compared to second quarter? Or have you changed any of your DeNovo plans to make that look a little differently? COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE Well, all I would suggest is we are constantly evaluating, Peyton, kind of where we are. And you've got a number of businesses that are taking place and in different stages of development. For example, we talked about on the mortgage side, the mortgage business is really doing exceptionally well, so you would have some expenses. And that is a high efficiency ratio business, as we all know. So you got certain things like that that are going to effect the absolute ratios that you see. I would suggest that from everything that we have seen, we're getting the cost savings that we had anticipated. We are suggesting that they are phasing in over time. We're doing it methodically. Some of this also, as we have talked about, given by for example, either the branch consolidations. We have leases that are going to expire, essentially, and we will be replacing them. We're doing some buildout and replacing of some of the facilities to try to improve them. There are temps that we have onboard and things of that nature that naturally well trend out, and we have turnover. There's a number of factors that are going to affect that expense figure -- that expense line over this time. And then to layer in over the top of that other initiatives that we have. We have described, for example, the technology side and what we have been doing. And layering in some of those costs. So again, it's kind of hard to isolate. There's no line item per se that is driven by that. But there are going to be changes that are going be taking place on the expense side over time. DARYL BYRD - IBERIABANK Corporation - President and CEO Peyton, I would step back and remind you that we narrowed the guidance in this conference call. We're very constable with that guidance. James Abbott - FBR - Analysts And then on your DeNovo plans, what kind of things are you all thinking about going forward in your respective markets? COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE Let me just talk for a second about that, and this is based on -- and we have said this publicly before. We have certain markets that we think our business model would work exceptionally well in. And we're constantly working on those markets and that is going to happen over time. Some of them are just natural extensions of our current markets and others are markets that we know well where we have got some folks that we think in the recruiting process would rework well, or that there are some folks we would like to team up with. I think what you see is that is a constantly evolving situation. And it is somewhat opportunistic in how we're going to approach that. And we certainly have that and we've identified them in the past. COMPANY SPEAKER And, Peyton, we're going to be pretty careful in what we disclose for competitive reasons. James Abbott - FBR - Analysts Okay, just generally speaking would you say that there are more opportunities now than there were 6 to 9 months ago? 18 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

JULY 23, 2003 / 1:30PM, IBKC - Q2 2003 IBERIABANK CORP Earnings Conference Call COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE We're very confident in the opportunities that we see out in front of us. James Abbott - FBR - Analysts Okay. Good enough. And then in terms of the sale of excess property, do you anticipate selling any property, either yours or Acadiana, once you get the branches consolidated, or is it lease issues? COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE Let me remind you, Peyton, most of the branches have been consolidated. We have a few that are left. There is not a tremendous amount of savings that we would anticipate on top of what we've already got. COMPANY SPEAKER Some of the lease properties. COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE But there are lease properties, but there are also some other facilities in particular that we will be selling. And again, it is a question of we have been gone through the complete closure of those facilities, and you've got your dark periods and other things, so it is going to take some time to kind of work our way through the sale of (multiple speakers). James Abbott - FBR - Analysts Okay. And is the Britania (ph) branch up and running? COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE No, it is not. We continue to work on that. Operator Mr. Davis, there are no further questions. Please continue. JOHN DAVIS - IBERIABANK Corporation - Senior Executive Vice President I pass it to Daryl. DARYL BYRD - IBERIABANK Corporation - President and CEO Folks, thank you for joining us this morning. And we appreciate your continued confidence in our organization.

JULY 25, 2003 / 12:30PM, FAL_pa.TO^G08 - Q2 2003 NORANDA INC Earnings Conference Call Derek Pannell - Noranda Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer Good morning, everyone. I'd like today to, first of all, make a few general remarks, then talk a little about the recapitalization plan that we announced this morning, then I will be handing over the call to Lars-Eric Johannson, who will go through our second quarter results and update you on those, and then before handing it back to Denis for questions, I'd like to just make a few wrap-up remarks. First of all, in the second quarter, we did, in fact, end the strike at the Horne. We have an agreement with the union there that I think is quite positive for both ourselves and for our employees and enables us to go forward in a very positive way to rebuild the customer base that we had, both on the concentrate and recycle side. At the same time, we, in the same quarter, have also signed the three contracts with Brunswick mining and smelting and also the contract at Lomas Bayas in Northern Chile, the latter four, of course, without any work stoppages. We have also completed and closed out the contract with Chrysler for the manufacture of original equipment wheels and have shut down the Correterro Mexico plant where we're in the final stages of shutting down the plant that made those OEM wheels. So that all of the wheels we are now producing at American Racing, after-market wheels that are making a cash margin. During the quarter we also raised $260 million of cash, first of all through $150 million preferred share issue, and secondly through the sale of another 25 percent of Noranda income fund units. Although that was initiated during the second quarter, it will not actually be booked because the sale was not completed until the third quarter. It actually finished at the beginning of July. In the same quarter, we also retired $200 million of 8% debt and, as you know, it will be announced this morning, a recap at the I will sayings plan to better position the company for the future. Turning now to our recapitalization plan, one of the corner stones will be the $500 million equity issue, common share issue, that we would expect to do during the second half of this year. BrassCan has agreed to subscribe to up to $300 million of that issue. The proceeds will be used to redeem $150 million of preferred shares to reduce debt and augment general financial resources. This additional equity will add substantially to our financial flexibility. It's going to improve our balance sheet ratios and will improve our cash flow and we've also announced that we will be converting to U.S. dollar reporting effective at the beginning of the third quarter, this quarter, and essentially all the prices for our products, all the metal prices, TCRC's, are quoted in U.S. dollars, so it certainly makes sense, from that revenue standpoint, to make this move. Now, over 55 percent of our asset base is located outside of Canada and, in fact, is growing. During this last quarter, we've seen the final shutdown of the magnesium plant in Canada. We cast the last magnesium billet on April 15th The further 25 percent through the Noranda income fund has had a tendency also to reduce assets in Canada and, in addition, the start up of Altonorte and bringing on stream of that smelter to in excess of 100 percent of its design capacity during the quarter, and also during this last quarter aluminum foil plant in Huntingdon,Tennessee, Quantum Leap, achieved more than 60 percent of the design capacity, and with all the products sold, we're using the 60 percent as a completion of the project, and that increases our assets outside of Canada. This conversion to U.S. dollar I think, as I've tried to explain, reflects really the company's primary economic environment now and financial reporting, I think, will be more readily comparable to our peer group and I think, in addition, has the potential to widen our shareholder base, and I think also in Europe. We have also announced a reduction of the common dividend this quarter from 20 cents down to 12 cents. this is a reduction of 40 percent. I think that this is a prudent measure, given the continuing low metal prices and the improving, but I think still uncertain, economic outlook. It also brings our rate in line with our industry peers and will improve our cash flow. We also expect to issue up to $300 million of additional debt in the second half of 2003 when we feel it's appropriate. This will be used to pre-fund the $300 million U.S. debt that matures on June 15th of next year. This will, I believe, benefit from the prevailing low interest rates that exist right now and have existed for some time and, again, will also improve our cash flow. 3 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

JULY 25, 2003 / 12:30PM, FAL_pa.TO^G08 - Q2 2003 NORANDA INC Earnings Conference Call We've also, on the 1st of July, with our partners, submitted the documentation that releases the Antamina debt and turns it nonrecourse. The banks have 45 days to protest that something was wrong. We don't believe that's likely to be the case, but essentially the debt, effective the 1st of July, has gone nonrecourse. All of the documents have been submitted, and the project is operating extremely well. In fact, the last quarter, we were at 73,000 tons of throughput compared to a design capacity of 70,000 tons and, again, that releases Noranda from another financial obligation. All in all, the measures that I've just gone over and have raised $1 billion in capital, or will raise $100 billion in capital and will certainly improve our net debt to total capitalization ratio. Our calculations show that at the year end last year, year end of December 2002, we were at 51 percent, and we expect that after this plan has been completed, we will be at 38 percent, a major improvement and we think that these measures will certainly reposition, in an industry which has experienced many changes. We have at Noranda, I think, as most people will know who have followed us, we've been, in the last two years, through some very difficult changes. We've reduced the work force quite substantially, not much less than 20 percent now. We've shut down some uneconomic plants, we've cut costs considerably but at the same time, we have started up some very low-cost world class operations. The measures that we're taking in this recapitalization savings plan are very much a complement to the measures we've taken. They build on the accomplishments that we've already proven, on the operational side, build on those, they allow us flexibility, and they added essentially a solid financial to our operating base, so that we are indeed well positioned for the worth of times and also for the best of times. Turning now to the first quarter results and I will go through and do some highlights there. And I think, talking of that underlying performance, I'd like to point out that during this quarter, the EBITDA was maintained at 229 $230 million, in the second quarter, versus in the same quarter last year of $235 million and in the face of continuing low metal praises and a currency impact that was quite considerable in the last quarter. In addition, we've done that in the face of rising energy costs and actually, although it's been now settled, the Horne strike was in progress too. Turning to the South American operations, the Collahuasi expansion is on plan and on budget and actually right now is around 47% complete and is going ahead very well and should be on stream in the middle of 2004. Antamina, as I mentioned earlier, is going extremely well, operational wise, and we have, with our partners, put in a new management structure there, new CEO and VP of operations and I think Antamina is well aligned to continue to perform well. Lomas Bayas, again performed slightly ahead of plan. We have a crusher expansion, a project that is approved and underway. We started the engineering, and we would expect that to be up and operating in the middle of 2004. Altonorte, as I mentioned earlier, has exceeded our expectations. We are expecting to be fully up to capacity in July. In fact, April and May, we operated greater than the design rate. However, we have some very high-grade concentrates there and somewhat of an inventory buildup that will be coming down in the next couple of months. A part of that buildup is due to the lack of a casting wheel, and that will be installed in the middle of this month, and at the end of this month will be operational, so that project will then be complete. Canadian Copper and Recycling Plant, the operations, as you know, has resumed at the Horne smelter, and we have reached normal operating levels. We announced 125 reduction in work force, unionized work force at the Horne that has been implemented already. We also announced a reduction of 85 people at the Kidd operation, and that also has been enacted and, in fact, that is the restructuring charges that you can see in our financials for this year. At the Kidd mine, the upper mine, which is a somewhat older mine, of course, we're not down yet to the deep levels, expanded levels,but we did suffer from some access to one of the higher grade stokes there. We've done some reconditioning work this quarter, and we would expect to be back on plan after that for the rest of the year at Kidd. The recycling business is ramping up extremely well after the strike. We certainly seem to have kept our customers, and we are seeing some increase in volumes on the recycle side, so we're very happy about that. 4 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

JULY 25, 2003 / 12:30PM, FAL_pa.TO^G08 - Q2 2003 NORANDA INC Earnings Conference Call I think we have noted some potential changes in the CC&R operations, Kidd, and the Horne. At the present time, we're not prepared to talk about those initiatives other than to say that we have made considerable changes to what I will call the base case and I think right now we would plan to see how those work out with the reductions of some, as I said, in excess of 200 people. Nickel, we've had excellent performance there, particularly benefited from the higher prices that were offset by currency and energy prices, and I think the Falcon Bridge Review has given a complete review of nickel, so I won't go into that further. The zinc operations, again, increased productions there year over year, two mines, the Brunswick and Bell Allard have operated extremely well, continue to be cash positive even at the price we had in the second quarter, seen something of a minor price increase recently but operating very well, those mines. Brunswick smelter began its four-month shutdown in the middle of June. We have sold concentrates, or switch concentrates, lead concentrates and it will be back up and have a full concentrate availability when it comes back up. It's operated well, but, of course, the contract with present TCRC"s the contract Noranda has to maintain, the concentrate has dragged down the zinc operating results. In the aluminum side, we had higher production compared to second quarter, both from the primary aluminum smelter that was up about 5 percent compared to last year, and at Noranda we were up 15 percent compared to last year. So solid operating performance at both of those aluminum divisions, somewhat offset by higher power and natural gas charges. That's my summary of where Noranda stands. I'd like to hand the conference call over to Lars-Eric Johannson to talk about the financials. Lars-Eric? Lars-Eric Johansson - Noranda Inc. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Derek and good morning, everyone on the line. This morning we reported a loss of $50 million, or 11 cents per share for the second quarter. Before unusual items, a restructuring charges are $12 million after tax, and a tax credit of $7 million. The loss was $10 million. This compares favorably to the loss of $29 million recorded in the first quarter of this year before shutdown costs related to the magnesium plant. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, EBITDA of $229 million was heavily impacted by the stronger Canadian dollar, before hedges, the impact was $55 million. In spite of the unfavorable exchange rate, EBITDA was virtually the same as a year ago in the previous quarter. As a result of higher sales volume and production, lower operating costs with the exception of energy and, of course, also higher nickel prices impacted. Depreciation, amortization was lower than a year ago, as a result of the sale of CSF to the Noranda income fund and lower provisions for explanations as we made a one-time provision of $12 million in the second quarter of last year. Restructuring costs for the quarter include $9 million provision relate to work force reductions of about 200 people. $5 million of shutdown costs of the magnesium plant and another $6 million of shutdown costs related to the closure of American Racing Mexican plant. Interest expense have increased as interest have previously capitalized on the magnesium project are now expensed. If we exclude the after-tax gains of $66 million recorded in the second quarter of last year, when we still see the Noranda income fund, and other long recurring items, net earnings improved by $7 million. The major variance, $23 million after tax, relates to the stronger Canadian dollar which was already mitigated by a stronger variance of $11 million on our hedging activities. With the exception of energy, operating costs and volumes were favorable compared to the same quarter a year ago. However, energy costs have come down from the level of the first quarter this year. With the exception of nickel which increased by 21 percent compared to the same quarter a year ago, zinc, copper, and aluminum prices were virtually flat, and the Canadian dollar was 10-percent stronger than a year ago. 5 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

JULY 25, 2003 / 12:30PM, FAL_pa.TO^G08 - Q2 2003 NORANDA INC Earnings Conference Call Looking at our business units, how they're doing, improved EBITDA in our nickel and Canadian copper and recycling businesses were offset by lowering numbers in the zinc, copper and aluminum business compared to the same quarter a year ago. For the first six months of the year, EBITDA improved by $13 million to $449 million in spite of the stronger Canadian dollar exchange rate. Our copper business unit in South America continued to turn in very solid earnings and cash flow. During the quarter Antamina basically operated at its new capacity. The lower copper production is the result of lower copper grade at Collahuasi and Antamina. At Antamina, the lower copper grade in the quarter was offset by higher zinc grade and zinc production. Operating costs per pound of copper continue to trend down in spite of slightly lower production and was 38 cents during the quarter. Lower production at the Canadian copper and recycling business unit is a result of the Horne strike that now has been resolved. The amount of recycled materials processed continued to increase in spite of the strike. EBITDA and operating income for the same quarter last year was affected by the shutdown of the [Gatsby] center. Our nickel business unit continued to benefit from the high nickel price but also production volumes increased compared to the same quarter last year. Falcon is still suffering from high oil prices. The cash operating price per pound of nickel increased from U.S. $1.92 to $2.20 at the integrated nickel operation as a result of the stronger Canadian dollar and significant lower Canadian prices. In our zinc business, the Brunswick and Bell Allard mines continued to be cash positive in spite of very low zinc prices. The negative EBITDA of $17 million in the quarter is a result of the fixed-price supply contract that Noranda has entered into with the Noranda income fund which was discussed at the last conference call. Our primary aluminum smelter continued to operate at the new higher capacity. The lower EBITDA and the higher operating cash costs per pound of aluminum from 49 cents to 52 cents per pound is a result of higher energy costs, natural gas, and electricity, which was partly offset by the higher production volumes. The smelter is not affected by the recent increase in aluminum prices, as we have a long-term fixed-price contract poor the aluminum supply. During the quarter, the new plant, Quantum Leap, reached 60-percent of its designed capacity, as Derek mentioned. In spite of a slowdown in the market during the second quarter, the volume increased, and we were able to maintain the higher fabrication spread achieved in the first quarter. EBITDA was likely lower as a result of higher prices for natural gas. As a result of the termination of the final OEM contract at American Racing, the Mexican plant will be shut down, and the results for the quarter has been reduced by a $6 million provision for the restructuring. EBITDA has also been negatively impacted by the slowdown in the market for after-market wheels. Moving on to our financial position, cash flow from operations improved to $201 million compared to $153 million for the same quarter a year ago. The increase in working capital, both for the quarter and year to date, is temporary and caused by the strike at the Horne smelter, the fire at the Belledune silver refinery and the buildup of copper process at the Altonorte smelter. When the new casting wheel at Altonorte that's been commissioned later this month, the inventory will come down. We also had more than normal annex in the pipeline between Altonorte and Collahuasi. We expect working capital to come down to the same level as last year end during the balance of the year. Capital expenditures amounted to $154 million compared to $206 million the same quarter a year ago. Before financing activities and dividends, we reached our objective to be cash neutral during the year. The major capital investment continued to be the Collahuasi mine transition and expansion and the Kidd mine deed development. We are now forecasting our capital expenditures to be about $700 million for the year, which is lower than previous plans. Our balance sheet continued to improve. We have reduced our debt by $680 million during the year and increased our cash position by almost $100 million, to $554 million. 6 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

JULY 25, 2003 / 12:30PM, FAL_pa.TO^G08 - Q2 2003 NORANDA INC Earnings Conference Call In addition to our cash position, we had undrawn bank lines available at the end of the quarter of $1 billion. The net debt to capitalization ratio has thus improved from 54 percent to 49 percent on a consolidated basis, and from 51 to 46 percent on an unconsolidated basis. On a pro forma basis after recording the net profit of $111 million and, again, of $41 million after tax, from the sale of 25 percent of the Noranda income fund in July and the net profit from the proposed common equity share, our net debt to capitalization ratio will improve further to 38 percent on an unconsolidated basis. After the proposed recapitalization, we will meet our objective to have a strong balance sheet that will make investment-grade ratings criteria and give us flexibility. We will also change our reporting and currency to U.S. dollar as of July 1st. At almost 60 percent of our asset base now is outside Canada as a result of the capital investments we have made in the U.S. aluminum business. As a result of a debt to capitalization ratio should not be affected by movements in the U.S./Canadian dollar exchange rate. Finally, I would like to remind you about our earnings sensitivity to rising metal prices. A 10-percent increase in the price of our four major methods will add about $150 million to our net earnings. A 10-percent stronger U.S. dollar will add another $85 million to earnings. On balance, prices for our major methods are now approximately 5 percent higher than the average price obtained in the second quarter and the potential is obviously there to benefit from higher metal prices during the second half of the year. So the present trend of stronger metal prices continues and I hand the presentation back to Derek Pannell. Derek Pannell - Noranda Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Lars-Eric. As you are aware, we believe that we continue to face somewhat uncertain market and economic conditions but it is our intention to maintain our focus on productivity and cost improvements, among others. We will also continue the strict capital investment discipline that we have initiated at Noranda. We believe with what we've announced today that we will emerge with a much improved asset base and increased earnings generating capability. We will all be well positioned, both financially and operationally, to benefit from any improving market fundamentals, as Lars-Eric mentioned. I think, too, that when the one-time restructuring costs are stripped away, you will see that we have achieved good, solid performance in the face of historically low prices and unfavorable foreign exchange, so that the underlying operations, I think, have improved substantially and make an excellent complement through the financial changes that we've announced today. Finally, we have extremely strong leverage to metal prices as they are improving. Thank you very much, and I'd like to turn it back to Denny Couture, who will open the call for questions. Denis Couture - Noranda Inc. - Vice President of Communications Thank you, Derek. Operator, would you please give the calling instructions before we open for questions and answers?

JULY 25, 2003 / 12:30PM, FAL_pa.TO^G08 - Q2 2003 NORANDA INC Earnings Conference Call If you are using a speaker phone please lift the handset before entering your request. Our first question comes from Terence Fornstrom with P.F.O. and Associates. Please proceed with your question. Terence Fornstrom - P.F.O. and Associates - Analyst Good morning. Let me start off by saying that I think the measures you're taken, probably along the area of option that you probably have, needs the most explaining. Could you go over the options that the board were presented, either internally or through the outside advisors, and in light of the option you may have had, why do you choose this option? The equity and BrassCan staying in the company. What other option have you looked at? Derek Pannell - Noranda Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer We can't really go over the entire process that we went through, but I think, Terry, as people who are on the line and have heard the comments over the months will know themselves that we have been through a major restructuring transformation within Noranda, and I think have achieved a lot. We put together, as management, a package that, I think, is complete, rather than pick away one part at a time, what we've tried to do is to put together a financial plan that I think makes us extremely well positioned and is an excellent compliment to all the changes that we've already brought within the operational side of the company. So as we come out of this historically long down period in the metals industry, I think Noranda is going to be well positioned both on an operational basis and a financial basis and it was that objective that we had in mind when we put this financial plan together. The different options that were considered were different kinds of equity, obviously the level at which we pitched the dividend, but I think I've tried to explain why we did what we did. We believe that the dividend is pitched at a level that is consistent with our peers in the industry, as we come out of the down-turn, I think it's something that is sustainable. But I think also it's a prudent level, given that the recovery and the improvement in metal prices is still relatively uncertain. Terence Fornstrom - P.F.O. and Associates - Analyst Derek, the present management team at Noranda has been very proactive and obviously, management has been quite lauding the activities that they have put further, shutting down, restructuring also reorganizing and aligning. However, I think your Board is out of touch with reality. I think your Board is either not getting the advice or not market savvy. The issues are, you're kind of ballooning this thing out but to kind of see what the market reaction would be, but if I were a shareholder of Noranda, I would have seen more like maybe asset sale and/or let the parent organization have a complete detachment from the company and since the present management has proved themselves, then let them stand on their own merit and go on. I think they are, again, half measures, and I believe that the issues that the Board is concentrating on right now is, once again, incomplete. So that's my comment, that's not a question. Thanks. Denis Couture - Noranda Inc. - Vice President of Communications Well, Terry, you know, it's clearly stated, how I believe it's pitched. I think it's excellent complete package, well done, but I certainly respect your opinion, and we will look forward to discussing it with you in the future. 8 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

JULY 25, 2003 / 12:30PM, FAL_pa.TO^G08 - Q2 2003 NORANDA INC Earnings Conference Call Operator Our next question comes from the line of Tony Lesiac with H,S,B,C. Please proceed with your question. Tony Lesiac - H.S.B.C. - Analyst Good morning. Just a couple of questions. I guess this means that BrassCan is going to be in it for the long haul. Do you know if they're going to be putting Noranda back on their books? Derek Pannell - Noranda Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer No, I can't speak for BrassCan. I think -- but certainly BrassCan support and not just this, not just with the announcements of today but with the earlier bridging 300 million, offered 150 million that was transacted, I think clearly BrassCan support has been there and has been very helpful. I don't think that this is a change in BrassCan's attitude towards Noranda. I've certainly not perceived it as such, but I think it's a continuing demonstration of that same support that we saw at the beginning of the year. They have agreed to purchase up to 300 million of the equity issue. Tony Lesiac - H.S.B.C. - Analyst I guess, sort of a follow-up question, this is for Lars-Eric, how much do you still have outstanding for Magnola on your books, and why didn't you just write all of it off in this one shot? Lars-Eric Johansson - Noranda Inc. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer We haven't changed that. It's still 300 million. We believe that in due course magnesium prices might come back, and if that's the case, we have an option for the future of producing 60,000 tons of magnesium. Tony Lesiac - H.S.B.C. - Analyst Lars-Eric, remind me, what's the sustaining capital for Magnola at this stage, just to keep it moth balled? Lars-Eric Johansson - Noranda Inc. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer It is a couple of million a year. Tony Lesiac - H.S.B.C. - Analyst The contract for the New Madrid smelter, can you comment on that? You indicated that costs for your smelter have gone up? Derek Pannell - Noranda Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer It's a two-year contract that started on the 1st of June, May 30th or 1st of June of this year, two-year contract, and it right now is 31 cents, or 3.1 cents per kilowatt hour. 9 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

JULY 25, 2003 / 12:30PM, FAL_pa.TO^G08 - Q2 2003 NORANDA INC Earnings Conference Call Tony Lesiac - H.S.B.C. - Analyst Are there any escalators in there? Lars-Eric Johansson - Noranda Inc. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer There are, yes, but that's right at the top of the range. There's a trigger and a cap and right now it's at the cap of 31 cents. Tony Lesiac - H.S.B.C. - Analyst And, finally, on these currency hedges, from what I can gather they're probably worth a lot of money. Was there any talk about collapsing them at this stage or/and maybe you can just go flu what they are again going out for the next few quarters? Lars-Eric Johansson - Noranda Inc. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer We have in total about 850 million of forward, and they basically go out 24 months, and the average rate is about $1.51. Tony Lesiac - H.S.B.C. - Analyst Did you look at collapsing those maybe or somehow to raise some cash? Lars-Eric Johansson - Noranda Inc. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer No, we haven't. Tony Lesiac - H.S.B.C. - Analyst And I guess it's 850 U.S. right? Lars-Eric Johansson - Noranda Inc. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer 850 U.S., right. Tony Lesiac - H.S.B.C. - Analyst Thanks so much, Lars-Eric. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Ernie Nutter, RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Ernie Nutter - RBC Capital Markets - Analyst Good morning, gentlemen. Just looking down the list of items in the restructuring or recapitalizations here, you mentioned the issue of U.S. $300 million to refund company debt maturities. 10 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

JULY 25, 2003 / 12:30PM, FAL_pa.TO^G08 - Q2 2003 NORANDA INC Earnings Conference Call I'm just wondering, A, if this is in place, and whether it is or not, I suppose was this recapitalization really a prerequisite to get term debt? I know you have quite a bit in the way of revolvers, so was this a prerequisite, or was it viewed by management as a probability that some sort of restructuring would need to be done, recapitalization, to be able to secure that sort of term debt? Lars-Eric Johansson - Noranda Inc. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer We have already mentioned Ernie, that an investment grade balance sheet is important to us for our overall objectives and, of course, in renewing bank facilities, as well as public debt, it's quite helpful to have an investment grade and a strong balance sheet. So in doing this, it's, of course, you start with strengthening the balance sheet with equity, and then you'll renew the debt and in the present interest rates environment, very low interest rates, excess to capital, we think it would be a good opportunity if the market continued to be as good as it is right now, to do it in the earlier fourth and there is just a press release out where Moody's confirmed our investment grade credit rating. As some of you may know, we've been on the credit watch, and they have now confirmed, subject to implementation of the recapitalization plan, that the rating remains investment grade with a stable outlook. Ernie Nutter - RBC Capital Markets - Analyst So would it be fair to say that your investment grade rating was a factor, or driving force in this recapitalization? Lars-Eric Johansson - Noranda Inc. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer The objective has been to have a strong balance sheet, and that's the reason for the recapitalization. Operator Next question comes from the line of John Redstone, Scotia Capital, please proceed with your question. John Redstone - Scotia Capital - Analyst Two quick questions. First, some clarification about the intention of BrassCan regarding the equity issue. You mentioned that they may take up to $300 million of the $500 million. Is it your preference for them to do, so or would you rather them take a lower level? Derek Pannell - Noranda Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer I don't have a preference but the BrassCan have not indicated to me that it is their intention to increase their holding within Noranda, I suspect that they would be happy to maintain it where it is, but they are prepared to support the equity issue up to $300 million. Right now, they're around 41 percent, and you can calculate what their pro rata interest would be to maintain their proportion. John Redstone - Scotia Capital - Analyst I see. On a different subject regarding your aluminum foil operations, you mentioned that the rate in the quarter the operating rate, was 60 percent. 11 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

JULY 25, 2003 / 12:30PM, FAL_pa.TO^G08 - Q2 2003 NORANDA INC Earnings Conference Call Derek Pannell - Noranda Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer That's just for the new plant. John Redstone - Scotia Capital - Analyst Yeah, I'm sorry. That's what I mean. It's at 60 percent. When do you suspect that it will be at 100-percent operation? Derek Pannell - Noranda Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer We have it planned for the end of 2005, but that's not the plant itself that's our ability to maintain market discipline and to market share. We just can't flood the floor market suddenly with sheets, but the way that it's improving, I would expect it to come up much faster than that. What we are also doing is we would put more material through that plant and bring it up to 100 percent say by the middle of next year and we would cut back on the older plants, because our operating cost is lower at the new plant, so we would expect to have that up, let's say 100 percent, by the middle of next year. John Redstone - Scotia Capital - Analyst Okay. Thank you very much. Operator Our next questions comes from the line of David Charles with GMP. Please proceed with your question. David Charles - GMP - Analyst Yes, good morning, everybody. Two quick questions. Lars-Eric, does the pro forma balance sheet that you included in the presentation does it include the proportion of consolidation of the Antamina debt now that it's gone nonrecourse and, maybe a second question if you do know, do you know what the historic costs of the BrassCan interest is on a per-share basis? Lars-Eric Johansson - Noranda Inc. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer To answer your last question first. I don't know. And to your first question, Antamina debt will still be on our balance sheet. We are consolidating one-third of the balance sheet and income statement of Antamina. David Charles - GMP - Analyst So it is in the pro forma? Lars-Eric Johansson - Noranda Inc. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer It's in the pro forma, yes. 12 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

JULY 25, 2003 / 12:30PM, FAL_pa.TO^G08 - Q2 2003 NORANDA INC Earnings Conference Call David Charles - GMP - Analyst Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Bill Reed of Deutsche Banc Securities. Please proceed with your question. Bill Reed - Deutsche Banc Securities - Analyst Thank you very much. I just would like to applaud management for their demonstrated commitment to an investment-grade profile, especially since you act on the commitment as opposed to paying lip service to it. I have two quick questions. First, the pro forma calculations that are shown on the balance sheets show a long-term debt reduction of only $460 million, versus the $500 million issuance of equity. I was wondering what the perceived difference would be. Is it just, are we to assume that the absolute debt reduction is going to only be $460 million? Hello? Derek Pannell - Noranda Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer I'm just thinking about your question here to make sure we get the answer exact. Hang on one second. Could you just tell us which slide you're looking at? Bill Reed - Deutsche Banc Securities - Analyst It was on both slides. I don't have the slide number, but if you just look at the long-term debt of, say, for example, on the consolidated, it shows long-term debt on June 30, 2003, at 4083, then the pro forma is 3623. I make that a $460 million debt reduction as opposed to $500 million. Lars-Eric Johansson - Noranda Inc. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, the difference consists of 500 million in new common shares and the repayment of 150 million of BrassCan preferred shares. That's $350. Then it's $111 million net proceeds from the sale of Noranda income fund. Bill Reed - Deutsche Banc Securities - Analyst Okay. So -- okay. $500 less $350 plus the income fund. Lars-Eric Johansson - Noranda Inc. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Bill Reed - Deutsche Banc Securities - Analyst Okay. Just to make sure I understand, on the Antamina debt, it's your policy that even as a non-recourse basis you will continue to show that in your long-term debt amount? 13 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

And we have one-third of the debt as well as one-third of all the other items in Antamina's balance sheet and income statement. Bill Reed - Deutsche Banc Securities - Analyst Great. Again, thanks very much. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Greg Barnes with Canaford Capital. Please proceed with your question. Greg Barnes - Canaford Capital - Analyst I'm wondering if the recapitalization and strong balance sheet you've got post restructuring, is that going to signal a change in your intentions with respect to Falcon Bridge? Are you going to accelerate your acquisition of the company? Derek Pannell - Noranda Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer It doesn't change our policy as regards Falcon Bridge, what we've said in the past would still hold. It certainly doesn't make it any more difficult. Greg Barnes - Canaford Capital - Analyst Okay. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Ray Goldy of Solomon Partners. Please proceed with your question. Ray Goldy - Salomon Partners - Analyst Good morning, gentlemen. Looking at the press release announcing the recapitalization, one of the things that I notice, you start with a net to total capitalization ratio of 51 percent and you borrow and raise in equal amounts of money, which takes your ratio down to 38 percent. I have trouble with that arithmetic, I think what I'm missing in that arithmetic is the sale of the Noranda income fund and perhaps the repayment of some of the existing debt. Could you give me more clarification how you get from the 51 to the 38? Lars-Eric Johansson - Noranda Inc. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer We are already, I think, at 46 percent, and the recapitalization and the sale of Noranda income fund takes it down to 38 percent. We have had an improvement, as I mentioned, over the year. We raised 300 million in preferred equity and we also have the impact of the U.S. dollar exchange rate. 14 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

JULY 25, 2003 / 12:30PM, FAL_pa.TO^G08 - Q2 2003 NORANDA INC Earnings Conference Call Ray Goldy - Salomon Partners - Analyst Thank you very much. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Victor Lisvoroviche with Nesbitt Burns, please proceed. Victor Lisvoroviche - Nesbitt Burns - Analyst Good morning. I have two questions. I wonder if we could explore your change in dividend policy. I'm not quite sure I understand from your comments or the press release the logic of cutting it now. For decades the dividend has been higher than the peer group and management has been comfortable with that. You've been through, I think three recessions and protected the dividend. You've got your capital spending program behind you, and you've committed -- or you've constantly said that you were committed to the dividend. So, I find your statement that cutting it now is a good thing because you're going to be in line with the peer group is a little bit less than I would have expected in rationalization. Derek Pannell - Noranda Inc. - President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. If you lack back historically, I think you will see that the level that we were at, you've mentioned three recessions, I'm not sure that we've always been as high as we were, and the dividend certainly has varied. I would say also that hindsight, of course, is 20/20. When should we have done it and should we have done it now? I think a lot of us, and not just in Noranda, perhaps would have done things differently had we been able to predict two or three years ago what would happen. But as I've tried to explain rather than do a sort of a piecemeal job here, what we've tried to do is to put together a complete plan and announce quite clearly what our intentions are. And I think if you just sort of work through what you can do and which order one can do, clearly one can't issue common shares and then suddenly cut the dividend. So I think the whole package of what we've put together has consistency. So, it was looking at that, looking at what we've done and where we wanted to go. I think the package that we've put together here certainly complements what we've done already and puts us in good financial shape a lot more flexibility than we would have had had we tried to fix things up a little bit at a time. So, you know, I think the dividend is at a level that's closer to our peers and if you go back, it has varied over the years and it has been at lower levels than the six-odd percent. Clearly we've stuck out before. Certainly, it was a difficult decision and we've been through a whole series of difficult decisions but in the end, we had to make it and I think it was the right thing to do and I think it sets us up extremely well for the future. Victor Lisvoroviche - Nesbitt Burns - Analyst I don't disagree it's the rate thing to do, Derek, it's just the timing surprises me. 15 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

JULY 25, 2003 / 12:30PM, FAL_pa.TO^G08 - Q2 2003 NORANDA INC Earnings Conference Call The other question I had was related to your 38-percent calculation. If the debt issue is prefunding a U.S. maturity coming up in the middle of the next year, your 38 percent debt/equity ratio is only going to be good for something on the order of six months. Can you give us a sense of what it would be after you pay down that other debt at issue? It would obviously be somewhere between 31 and 38 percent. Lars-Eric Johansson - Noranda Inc. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer We have revolving facilities, basic facilities that we can pay down and, of course, we do this on a net debt-to capitalization ratio. And if we don't have any debt to pay down, it will end up as cash, but we would still net it, the way we do it and it's still 38 percent. Victor Lisvoroviche - Nesbitt Burns - Analyst Let me maybe ask another way. After you get the 30 percent you're going to have to -- and if you've applied the prefunding to paying off your revolvers, you're going to have to tap your revolvers in the middle of next year and raise your debt level. So at that point, what would the ratio be? Sorry? Lars-Eric Johansson - Noranda Inc. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer If we borrowed to pay down debt, then the debt is the same. Victor Lisvoroviche - Nesbitt Burns - Analyst Yes. But it would be -- it would take your ratio above 38 percent. Lars-Eric Johansson - Noranda Inc. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer No, it won't, because -- unless we increase our debt but our intention is not to increase our debt, on the contrary, our intention is to reduce debt. Victor Lisvoroviche - Nesbitt Burns - Analyst Okay. I'll have to work through the numbers, then. I'm not quite sure I'm following. Operator There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference back to you. Denis Couture - Noranda Inc. - Vice President of Communications Thank you very much. I would like to remind everyone that a recording of this teleconference will be available at 416-626-4100 and 1-800-558-5253, pass code 211-536-34, and a recording will be available at 10:30 this morning, will last until August 1st, 2003. In addition, the webcast will be available on our website. Thank you for joining us and good-bye. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We appreciate your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line. 16 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Mitchell Caplan - E*Trade Group Incorporated - CEO Thanks, everybody, for joining us this afternoon. Q2 2003 can be summarized in three words. Validation, innovation and discipline. In our first quarter earnings call, I spoke at some length about the philosophy that has guided E*Trade financial for over 20 years. Our goal has always been and remains to leverage innovative technology to provide superior financial products and services to our customers. During our second quarter, we experienced highly favorable market conditions. Interest rates remained low, fueling continued lending activity, and for the first time in over two years, investors returned to the equity markets, driving a significant increase in brokerage transaction volume. 2 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Earnings Conference Call Our diversified model enabled us to capitalize on these conditions. Our adherence to the core tenants of value and innovation helped us to transform opportunity into reward, and our disciplined management style produced changes that will help make us more efficient in future quarters. I'm pleased to announce that in Q2 2003, we produced GAAP earnings of 3 cents per share, which does include a charge of $76 million in restructuring and other exit charges as discussed on last quarter's earnings call. On an ongoing basis, earnings per share equaled 14 cents. Included in our ongoing earnings is a $7 million or 1 cent per share reserve taken in connection with possible remaining exposure in the MJK Securities litigation. Exclusive of the MJK litigation reserve, operating earnings equaled 15 cents, and our strong quarterly earnings allowed us to increase the bonus accrual for employees by an additional 1 cent per share. In both our banking and brokerage segments, our commitment to efficiency and technological advantages helped produce excellent ongoing operating margins and income, and in both of our segments, we delivered pioneering products that have increased our market share, volume, and customer satisfaction. We've often said there are efficient brokerage platform transforms incremental trade into bottom line results. During the second quarter, transactions increased 41% from the prior quarter. This increase drove a 5-cent improvement in brokerage earnings per share from quarter to quarter. The positive impact of increased trading activity can be seen throughout our reported brokerage revenue lines, including commissions, principal transaction and net interest income. And the increased activity in the equity markets this quarter that benefited our retail business also produced positive results in our institutional trading and market-making businesses. These improvements illustrate the upside power of our brokerage business. Innovations have strengthened our active trader value proposition. During the quarter, we grew our market share in this category and our active traders showed a 42% increase in trading activity over last quarter. Our Power of 9 campaign continues to resonate well, particularly with the implementation of aggressive pricing on options trading and margin rates. And we expect continued market share growth as we launch new products and improve functionality in the second half of the year. Today we announced the addition of Jack Sander to our team. Jack brings to the company over 20 years of experience as former Chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Drawing on this experience, Jack will help us to roll out new trading capabilities and E-minis, our electronically traded index futures to our customers in the coming months. Our value proposition for Main Street investors is also resonating as well. Our Main Street customer trading activity increased 40% quarter-over-quarter. We gained share over traditional competitors in part because we believe that in these uncertain economic times, customers seek value and performance, which they've been able to find at E*Trade Financial. Today we announce our plans to bring the same value and innovation that we brought to equity investing, banking, and lending to the mutual fund industry and investing. Working in cooperation with mutual fund families and regulatory agencies, and within applicable regulatory standards, we intend to rebate 50% of the 12B1 and shareholder service fees that we receive from the fund companies directly to our fund customers. By leveraging technology as our differentiator, we can take advantage of the increased scale we expect to create as a result of this initiative. We believe this program will accomplish three important objectives, including reducing the impact of fees incurred by fund shareholders, enhancing the attractiveness of fund investing, and increasing the number and average asset size of accounts at E*Trade Financial. We plan to implement this initiative later this year. In banking, we remained focused on maximizing the benefit of the low interest rate environment by offering excellent lending products, competitive pricing, and exceptional service. At the same time, we are also preparing for a rising interest rate environment, and we continue our ongoing effort to widen net interest spreads while carefully managing credit risk. We approach widening net interest spread by prudently diversifying our asset portfolio and by growing transactional accounts to reduce costs of funding. We recently completed the purchase of $400 million in high FICO auto loans with a weighted average score of 754, and the acquisition of $100 million of high credit quality credit card assets with a weighted average FICO score of 705. In addition, we continue to grow transactional accounts. During the quarter, we launched several important product enhancements. A dramatically improved Web site, a total guarantee on the safety and privacy of our online banking services, and a quick transfer feature that enables customers to seamlessly move funds between E*Trade accounts and between E*Trade and other financial institutions. These enhancements helped drive deposit growth of $139 million during the quarter to over $9 billion in deposits. Transactional accounts grew by $102 million during the period and represent 52% of our total deposit base. In Q2 03, as in Q1, continued strength of the mortgage market propelled prepayments to very high levels, driving down asset yields on our mortgage-related assets. Consequently, net interest spread for the quarter equal to 144 basis points, an 8 basis point decline over last quarter. So although we are 3 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call pleased with our spread widening initiatives, results were dampened by the effect of continued prepayment. Importantly, though, the pressure on net interest spreads was again more than offset by record performance in our mortgage business. Our mortgage business hit yet another milestone by originating a record $2.9 billion in loans during the quarter. As a result, the $4 million improvement in pre-tax income generated by the increase in mortgage production this quarter more than offset the $3 million decrease in net interest income resulting from the 8 basis point decline in net interest spread. Further, we are closing the quarter with a pipeline of $1.7 billion in locked loans, an increase of 42% over the pipeline of $1.2 billion at the end of our first quarter. While we are certainly pleased with these results, we are preparing for rising interest rates by increasing purchase money production to protect against an eventual dissipation of refinancing volume. To this end, we introduced our mortgage on the move program last month. Mortgage on the Move is the industry's first widely available portable mortgage product for purchase money customers. It is yet another example of E*Trade Financial as a customer Champion and innovator. We are pleased with the overwhelming media and customer response the product has received. We also continue to grow our consumer finance business. Our RV and marine business produced loan volumes of $398 million during the quarter. In addition, we launched quick transfer functionality between home equities and deposits, enabling our customers to move their money seamlessly between accounts, and we have continued to build out our auto and credit card offerings. As interest rates rise, mortgage volumes will decline. We are confident, however, in our ability to offset the related revenue and income reduction. In a rising interest rate environment, we have a greater ability to widen interest rate spread. Put simply, the diversification inherent in our banking model protects us as interest rates rise. While the past quarter was a successful one for both of our business segments, we continue to approach our operations with rigor and discipline. To this end, we have taken a restructuring charge of $76 million this quarter. Of this amount, $14 million was in cash-related charges. We are pleased to report that we are ahead of schedule on these initiatives. Second quarter charges included closure of our New York center, elimination of unprofitable product offerings such as stock baskets, E*Trade Financial advisor and Personal Money Management, and closure of 43 E*Trade Financial target zones. As mentioned in last quarter's earnings call, we intend to take an additional charge of approximately $45 million in the third quarter. During Q3, we expect to complete our restructuring that will include closure of our banking operations in Denmark, discontinuation of local market equity trading operations in Hong Kong, and consolidation within our Menlo Park, Rancho Cordova and New York facilities. Through these and additional steps, we expect to generate between $45 and $50 million in annual savings, beginning in the second half of this year. From 1998 to 2000, the online brokerage industry experienced unprecedented growth in the number of accounts opened. During the past three years, declining equity values and diminishing levels of trading activity by retail investors resulted in the accumulation of accounts of de minimis value. We believe that such accounts, while of potential value, should be distinguished from those of current actual value. There are approximately 1 million of these accounts. Accordingly, effective this quarter, we have placed these accounts on inactive status. By doing so, we no longer incur operational costs to service inactive accounts, and thereby further reduce operating expenses. Consistent with this action, we are modifying our definition of an active account to include accounts with a balance of at least $25 or that have Traded within the last six months. Although these accounts will no longer be reported as active, customers will be able to easily reactivate these accounts at a time of their choosing. We continue to remain focused on revenue growth by expanding our relationship management program, which has already improved customer service and increased cross-sell, and we are committed to further enhancing our existing customers' experience and to creating and offering new and innovative products and services. During the remainder of the year, we will be launching improvements to many of our core products and deploying new value-added products. Before Len reviews the numbers, let me address just a few important issues. We have made significant progress this quarter toward successfully resolving the MJK situation. As previously announced, we have settled the Fiserv litigation and have obtained third-party reimbursements covering that liability completely. The Wedbush and Nomura matters remain outstanding, and we continue to vigorously defend ourselves in these matters. We believe, however, that between the third-party reimbursements that we have negotiated and the $7 million in legal reserves we booked this quarter, we have appropriate reserves to cover possible exposure in these matters. 4 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Earnings Conference Call Finally, in an ongoing effort to improve transparency in our business, we now show substantially more detailed information about our brokerage and banking operations in our quarterly press releases. Additionally, you will find new information around asset balances, account growth and account attrition, and as a prelude to our transition to natural account expense reporting beginning in 2004, you will also note our breakout of compensation and benefits expense in our corporate metric Section. Going forward, we also intend to provide monthly reports on key business drivers. Beginning in August, we will provide monthly daily average revenue Trades or darts, margin debt balances, equity shares Traded in our market making business, mortgage, and consumer loans funded, as well as account growth, active account, and total assets for both brokerage and banking. We believe that through increased disclosure and transparency, we can continue to improve investors' understanding of the company and demonstrate the strength of our business model. We believe that we are on the right path here. That our core tenants are sound, our model effective, and our approach rigorous, and we want people to see clearly what gives us the confidence that we have in our business and in our future. Now to Len. Leonard Purkis - E*Trade Group Incorporated - CFO Thanks, Mitch. First the financial highlights. Cash and equivalents for the quarter totaled $882 million. Free cash totaled $452 million this quarter, a $50 million increase over our first quarter. Free cash as we define it is a metric used by management in measuring business performance and represents cash held at the parent and excess regulatory capital of bank and brokerage. At the bank, net charge offs fell to $7 million this quarter, down from $8.8 million last quarter. Overall net charge offs as a percentage of average held for investment loans declined from 65 basis points to 49 basis points, driven by an improvement in our consumer finance portfolio net charge offs. Our allowance for loan losses grew by 12% from $29.2 million to $32.7 million quarter-over-quarter, as we provisioned in excess of our net charge offs. Our reserves now represent 140% of total non-performing loans, and that's a 21% increase over last quarter. As a percentage of ending health for investment loans, the reserve remained flat with first quarter with 52 basis points. Our commitment to strong credit is manifest in the credit quality of our borrowed as measured by weighted average FICO scores. Specifically, FICO scores for a total loan portfolio average 730, up slightly from 729 last quarter, but our mortgage and consumer portfolios averaging 725 and 732 respectively. E*Trade Bank also remains well capitalized, as defined by the office of (inaudible) provision with tier 1 and risk-based capital ratios of 5.94% and 11.8% compared to 5.9% and 12.2% (inaudible). Finally, as you will see in our expanded metrics table, we now offer a darts metric, which includes professional, domestic, and international revenue Trades. This metric differs from our daily average transaction metric, which we report for the last time this quarter in that our transaction metric included both revenue and non-revenue trade executions while excluding professional and other commission-based revenue Trades. Although there's absolutely no economic impact with this change, we believe this improvement offers a more comparable commission for trade measure. With this and the other additional metrics provided, we feel investors have the tools necessary to understand the business and the drivers that affect our top and bottom lines. Next, our revenues. Total net revenues for our second quarter totaled $381 million, an 18% improvement over last quarter, and a 21% improvement over same quarter last year. Increasing revenues quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year is a result of growth in both brokerage and banking revenues. Brokerage revenue for the quarter totaled $223 million, a 26% increase from last quarter, and a 4% increase from same quarter last year. This increase is the result of a significant growth in trading activity during the quarter in both our retail and market-making businesses, improving commission revenue by 41% and principal transaction revenues by 39%. Banking revenue for the second quarter totaled $158 million, up 9% over last quarter, and up 57% over same quarter last year. This increase is related to the growth in both gain on sale of originated loans from our direct to retail mortgage and consumer finance origination businesses, and gain on sale of loans held for sale and securities from our correspondent mortgage business and partially offset by a decline in net interest income. The decline in net interest income comes as a result of accelerated prepayments in our mortgage portfolio, reducing our net interest spread over the quarter. Now, for the expenses. On the expense side, we saw a 21% and a 31% increase in general and administrative expense quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year same quarter respectively. This increase is largely attributable to the $7 million MJK litigation reserve. We kept cost of services largely in check this quarter, seeing only a 9% increase over last quarter on an 18% increase in net revenues over the same period. The $15 million increase over the quarter is largely related to compensation of benefits, more specifically, bonus accrual and variable compensation driven by the mortgage 5 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Earnings Conference Call and market-making activity. In selling and marketing expense, we saw an 8% increase quarter-over-quarter and a 5% decline year-over-year, same quarter. Half of the increase was related to variable costs associated with our institutional business, and the other half of the increase was in support of our highly targeted marketing campaigns. Their effective marketing campaigns like the Power of 9 supporting our strong value proposition, we believe we have again this quarter gained market share in online trading. The operating leverage in our brokerage business is particularly apparent on a segment basis. Brokerage operating expenses totaled $259 million this quarter, including $68 million in restructuring and other asset charges and $7 million in MJK litigation reserves. Excluding these charges, our brokerage operating costs totaled $183 million, only a 9% increase over last quarter and a 26% growth in brokerage revenue. Importantly, we are also able to control operating costs in banking, limiting the total increase to 15%, including $7.7 million in restructuring and other exit charges. Net of restructuring charges, bank-operating costs grew by 9%, in line with an equivalent growth in revenue. After non-operating income and expense, as you will note in the non-operating (inaudible) section of our P&L. It is clear to $22 million net gain on investments. At the end of last quarter, E*Trade Group held a 36% ownership interest in E*Trade Japan, which was accounted for under the equity method. On June 2nd, 2003, E*Trade Japan merged with Softbank Investment Corporation to form a new entity called SBI. Upon closing the merger, E*Trade Group owned 19.8% of SBI. We have determined that we no longer exercise significant -- or control over the new entity and it should, therefore, account for our investment in SBI under the cost method. (inaudible) equity security. In accordance with GAAP, we have recognized $29.5 million gain on investment based on the fair value of the SBI shares we received as of the merger date. The fair market value of our interest in SBI based on yesterday's closing price on the Tokyo Stock Exchange is $255 million against a book basis of $84 million. This investment is part of a multi-step process to maximize shareholder value. In summary, the company reported second quarter net income of $13 million or GAAP earnings per share of 3 cents, which again includes $76 million in facility restructuring and other exit charges and $22 million in net gains on investments. Net income from ongoing operations totaled $50 million or 14 cents per share for ongoing operations. A reconciliation of the 4-cent quarter-to-quarter sequential increase to earnings per share from ongoing operations is as follows. First E*Trade actions increased 34,000 this quarter, driving increased earnings of 3.5 cents in our retail trading segment. Additionally, we gained an incremental penny and a half from our institutional and market-making businesses. Secondly, strong banking results generated an additional penny from bank. Thirdly, in total, incremental contribution from banking and brokerage was 6 cents per share. Netted against these results is a two-cent adjustment of the MJK litigation reserve and bonus accrual. For guidance in light of our performance this quarter and the accelerated benefit, we expect to see from our restructuring, we are raising our guidance for the year to between 52 and 57 cents per share from ongoing operations. On a recorded basis, the equivalent will be earnings per share of 22 to 27 cents including restructuring charges. The incremental revenue from increased trading activity we experienced this quarter dropped largely to the bottom line and demonstrated the leverage in our model. The combination of this leverage and the benefits of our restructuring plans were the drivers behind increasing our guidance for the year, but there obviously remains uncertainty about the economic recovery that could impact results. We are pleased to note as a result of continued strength of the markets, our DARTs for the first 15 days of July equaled 138,000. That's up 18% over quarter 2. The leverage of our model is validated in our results, and we have confidence in our ability to manage the uncertainties of the economy. With that, we'll now open this call up to answer your questions. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Operator Thank you. The floor is now open for questions.

Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We do ask while you pose your question that you pick up your handset to provide optimum sound quality. Thank you. Our first question is coming from Michael Vinciquerra of Raymond James & Associates. 6 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Michael Vinciquerra - Analyst - Raymond James & Associates Thank you. Good afternoon. First question is just a clarification for Len. I just want to make sure, the $22 million gain is considered a non-operating item and, therefore, it is not part of your operating earnings of 14 cents for the quarter, is that correct? Leonard Purkis - E*Trade Group Incorporated - CFO That's correct. Michael Vinciquerra - Analyst - Raymond James & Associates Ok. And then second of all, I just want to get a feeling from Mitch, obviously you're going through some significant cost savings right now and it seemed like the exercises are going to produce better results for the second half. How much of the improvement in your guidance, number one, is coming from the acceleration of the cost savings you're going to realize, and additionally, are there any other opportunities you see for cost savings beyond what you currently have planned maybe for the next 12 to 18 months, or is this pretty much going to take you to where you want to be? Mitchell Caplan - E*Trade Group Incorporated - CEO A couple things. First of all, Mike, as you look out at the second half of the year, Jarrett, as you know, has been driving the restructuring initiative, and he has us a bit ahead of plan as we talked about. So we'd expect to see somewhere in the neighborhood of 3 to 3.5 cents improvement in the next two quarters in our earnings as a result of the restructuring charge. And then once we enter into next year, you would expect to see about a full 2 cents per quarter or 8 cents a year. And that's in connection just with the restructuring charge. What it does more interestingly, I know we've talked for forever about where is break-even as you look at your brokerage business, and I think you and I have talked consistently about a break-even for the brokerage segment at around 63,000 transactions and now 63,000 DARTs a day. As a result of the restructuring charge, what we are now at is about 50,000, so as long as we are doing 50,000 DARTs a day, we are in a position that we are at break-even for our entire brokerage segment, and also is you see each additional 10,000 DARTs again, we will earn about 1.5 cents to the bottom line as we talked about and validated this quarter through the model. So that's the first part of your question. The second is, there are a host of other initiatives that are also in place independently of the restructuring charge that Jarrett's driving around technology and otherwise that we will continue to apprise you of as we go through quarter by quarter in terms of cost savings. Michael Vinciquerra - Analyst - Raymond James & Associates Ok. Thank you. I'll jump back in line. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from Richard Repetto of Putnam Lovell Securities. Richard Repetto - Analyst - Putnam Lovell Securities Hi, guys. Congrats on a nice quarter. 7 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Mitchell Caplan - E*Trade Group Incorporated - CEO Thanks, Rich. Richard Repetto - Analyst - Putnam Lovell Securities First a follow-up question on the guidance. The 52 to 57, and you back out 24, you get 32 to 33 for the second half of the year, and I assume that your 3 to 3.5 cents savings is for the second half, that's not per quarter. Mitchell Caplan - E*Trade Group Incorporated - CEO That's correct. Richard Repetto - Analyst - Putnam Lovell Securities So you obviously have a positive outlook, you know, from a 14-cent second quarter here that EPS is going to incrementally increase with even a potential slowdown in trading here in the summer. So what's driving the optimism, I guess? Leonard Purkis - E*Trade Group Incorporated - CFO Rich, it's Len. I think to the upper end of the guidance there are three things we really looked at as driving it. One is the current -- and we're talking about current July market conditions continued through the rest of the year. Secondly, the mortgage business volume is maintained through the end of the year and there's no major growth as we enter the third quarter, but we do have a pipeline of 1.7 billion, and the third part is the restructured benefits kicking in, in the second half for the 3.5 cents. So the low end of the range where we were looking at that is a magnitude of selloff in both transactions and the mortgage volume. Richard Repetto - Analyst - Putnam Lovell Securities Ok. And then my one follow-up would be, now you've went to a new classification on the Trades from transactions to daily average revenue Trades. To some number around a little bit less than 30,000, it looks like free Trades or Trades that (inaudible) accounted for as revenue Trades before. Could you explain what that was in the prior quarter? You reported 82,000 Trades last quarter. Now if you back out from the accounting, from what you reported here, it seems like we can did account for about 55,000 of that as revenue Trades, if you look at what you've disclosed. So what's the gap here? Trades given as promotion or mutual fund Trades or what? Leonard Purkis - E*Trade Group Incorporated - CFO I think you got a couple things in there, Rich. One is before we were -- as we've always done, we were reporting on transactions, and some transactions don't have revenue or didn't have revenue attached to them, so we also, though, at the same time didn't include revenue Trades from the professional segment, and as we committed to everybody, everything is under review these days, and our goal is to come out with more metrics and more clarity in our metrics, and we felt that going to where we've gotten to now with DARTs was just a better apples to apples comparison, so you and the rest of the investor community can really compare us to our competition, which as you know is something we're inviting everybody to do. So hopefully that explains it, but as you'll see, it comes out pretty much the same number. Richard Repetto - Analyst - Putnam Lovell Securities But the trades that weren't revenue trades last quarter, they were free trades given as promotion or ? 8 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

It's just if you were to come in and do a trade and it took you two executions, that was two transactions. Whereas that was one revenue trade. Richard Repetto - Analyst - Putnam Lovell Securities Ok. I'll get back in the queue as well. Operator Our next question is coming from Colin Clark of Merrill Lynch. Colin Clark - Analyst - Merrill Lynch Hello, everyone. Can you hear me? Leonard Purkis - E*Trade Group Incorporated - CFO Absolutely. Colin Clark - Analyst - Merrill Lynch Great quarter. Leonard Purkis - E*Trade Group Incorporated - CFO Thank Colin. Colin Clark - Analyst - Merrill Lynch I'm trying to get a better sense of your strategy to drive higher bank net interest income particularly if rates stay low and mortgage revenues decline as refi activity declines. You mentioned your current spread is 144 basis points. It's been under pressure the last couple quarters, and you previously had a spread target range of 160 to 190 in '03. Just interested in your thoughts on is that range achievable in the current environment, especially if the rates stay low? Leonard Purkis - E*Trade Group Incorporated - CFO Let me start and then have Lene sort of follow up. What I would tell you is as we just looked at guidance at a very high level, again, we're looking at the guidance for the company as a whole and we're breaking it down by segment between bank and brokerage. So what I think you can expect to see within the banking group is that to the extent that you still have extraordinary performance in your mortgage business, what will be driving it particularly to the extent that it's driven by refinancing and not purchase money mortgage, as you well know, is the low interest rates and that will generate prepayments which is going to continue to put pressure on spread. Our goal has always been to be in a position where in either direction, you had a dollar for dollar offset, so that as mortgage was stronger, you were at least making the same or more in the mortgage earnings that you were losing in spread which is what happened this quarter, you know, we outperformed to the tune of about $1 million.

Earnings Conference Call rates begin to rise, what you would expect to see is refinancing dissipate and our spread begin to widen and then you would look for, again, the opposite, which is that spread begins to compensate and outperform what's happening with respect to your mortgage business. (inaudible), I would tell you we are continuing to make efforts to widen spreads. We're doing it by looking at this asset diversification, we're doing it very slowly in order not to take what we perceive to be any significant credit risk, and we at the same time are looking to continue to lower our cost of funds with respect to our transaction costs. So you continue to take two steps forward with respect to spread widening, but inevitably, as long as the mortgage business is this strong, it's going to impact you on spread compression, and I think in order for us to get to our stated goal as you've said of 160 or 200, you will only get there when you begin to see some dissipation in the results of what you're seeing in the mortgage business. Colin Clark - Analyst - Merrill Lynch Ultimately, you know it's focused on credit quality that we've said over and over again, which will be the strongest limiting factor in terms of the speed in which we get the 200 basis points. We're confident that we're going to get there, and we keep taking (inaudible) that are moving us in the positive direction. The issue really is just in terms of optics and final reported numbers is that the positive direction is being mapped by the negative brought on by the prepayments. You know, so for example, as we diversify into a greater level of consumer finance assets, we're helping our spread, we're improving them, we're constantly looking from a balance sheet optimization point of view as to what to do. Leonard Purkis When you have the prepayments going the other way, it hurts you, so for example, when we were talking at the end of -- when we talked at the end of last quarter's call and everyone was expecting to see a 20 basis point improvement based on the Janus acquisition and instead we improved 12 basis points, it was because we went backward 8 by virtue of the prepayments on the mortgage side. So it's something that as we focus on credit, we just do things slowly and methodically, and one of the things that we've done is right (inaudible) at the end of the month, we took our first step into the credit cards when we bought a portfolio of just under $100 million to increase spread. Now, again, focusing on the credit quality, you know, were very high FICO scores. So it's very consistent with our overall strategy. It's just a question of time. Colin Clark - Analyst - Merrill Lynch Ok. So if refinancing -- or if prepays slow, you know, let's fast forward a couple of quarters, and prepays slow significantly but rates stay relatively flat, does that make it challenging to drive your spreads higher, or do you have some plans in place in that type of scenario? Leonard Purkis - E*Trade Group Incorporated - CFO We do have plans in place. We do a lot of scenario planning. It's not something that we're going to discuss now, but we do look at it in the very different interest rate environment. Colin Clark - Analyst - Merrill Lynch Ok. Great. I'll get back in the queue. Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from Charlotte Chamberlain of Jeffries & Company. Charlotte Chamberlain - Analyst - Jeffries & Company Hi. I was wondering, are you planning to put out some historical numbers on DART so that we can build a database to better forecast based on the (inaudible) that you're planning to give this out monthly? 10 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Earnings Conference Call Leonard Purkis - E*Trade Group Incorporated - CFO I suspect that you look at it where we are (inaudible) they are historical backing up for 6 or 8 quarters, so it's in what we've already released. Charlotte Chamberlain - Analyst - Jeffries & Company So you're not going back a couple of years or anything like that so we could kind of track it during the bubble as well? Leonard Purkis - E*Trade Group Incorporated - CFO No. I think it's been over the last - we think we've got it over the last six quarters. Charlotte Chamberlain - Analyst - Jeffries & Company Ok. And then also can you give us an idea of what proportion of your mortgages were fixed rate versus arms over this last quarter? Leonard Purkis - E*Trade Group Incorporated - CFO Yeah. We are now in a position where -- you're talking about originated or on balance sheet? Charlotte Chamberlain - Analyst - Jeffries & Company Originated. And which ones you keep. Leonard Purkis - E*Trade Group Incorporated - CFO So let's talk about what we keep first because I think that's what's relevant, which is what's on balance sheet. We're now at a position where on balance sheet, we're at about 50% fixed and with 50% variable. However, on an incremental basis over the last quarter or two quarters, we have been probably about 95% variable in terms of what we've added to our balance sheet. So we have strategically moved away from fixed and added almost exclusively variable on an incremental basis. Charlotte Chamberlain - Analyst - Jeffries & Company And originations, what would be the breakdown? Mitchell Caplan - E*Trade Group Incorporated - CEO The breakdown is in this absolutely low interest rate environment, it's been consistently above 90% in terms of fixed rates. Charlotte Chamberlain - Analyst - Jeffries & Company Ok. Thanks. 11 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Leonard Purkis - E*Trade Group Incorporated - CFO Sure. Operator As a reminder, if you do have a question or comment, you may press 1 followed by 4 on your touchtone phones. Our next question is coming from David Marsh of Friedman, Billings, Ramsey. David Marsh - Analyst - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey Hi, guys. This is a pretty good quarter here. Couple of questions. The cash portion of the charge that you expect to take in the next quarter, do you have an estimate as what that will be? Leonard Purkis - E*Trade Group Incorporated - CFO This past quarter, the charge, we took about a $76 million restructuring charge, and I think we said it was about 13 or 14 in cash. Next quarter, it will be again somewhere between $12 and $14 million in cash. David Marsh - Analyst - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey Ok. And on the portfolio of loans that you recently acquired, about 500 million total loans, what do you expect that to do for your net interest margin going into the third quarter? Leonard Purkis - E*Trade Group Incorporated - CFO A guess would be -- again, now you aren't looking at me because you want me to be careful, but the expectation is you'd hope it would widen your spread by 3 or 4 basis points, and it will. It will move us in that direction. Ultimately, where our spread will come out at the end of next quarter again will be driven by what's happening in the market refinancing business. David Marsh - Analyst - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey If yields -- if you'll indulge me one more follow had been-up, if yields were to stay around about where they are right now, do you have any sense of how much you could grow NIM in the third quarter? Leonard Purkis - E*Trade Group Incorporated - CFO If yields were to stay where they are right now, you would hope that you can continue to expand them 10 or 12 basis points. But I think that would depend entirely again upon what was happening in terms of the refinancing market. For the moment, as we've looked at the first 15 days of July again, it's interesting that we've seen transactions as strong as we've seen them and DARTs up 18% over last quarter for these first 15 days. Same is true on the fixed income side, we have actually seen a little bit of the slowing in the prepayment, which I think will be helpful, and I think really we have to wait to see what happens is in terms of the mortgage business and the volume there. David Marsh - Analyst - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey Ok. Thanks. 12 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Leonard Purkis - E*Trade Group Incorporated - CFO Sure. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from Justin Hughes of (inaudible). Justin Hughes - Analyst - Jefferies & Co. Question for Jarrett primarily. First of all, congratulations on the quarter. Excellent execution. Jarrett Lilien - E*Trade Group Incorporated - President and COO Thank you. Justin Hughes - Analyst - Jefferies & Co. I was wondering, on the professional segment, you're showing it on revenue per trade basis, but isn't that still priced on a per-share basis? Jarrett Lilien - E*Trade Group Incorporated - President and COO Yeah, part of the business is based on per-share, and part is, -- the short answer is we've got it split on where some of it goes. Some of it is within DARTs, and the rest is in --where is that now? Principal commissions. Justin Hughes - Analyst - Jefferies & Co. Ok. If somebody executes a trade and you charge like 1.5 cents per share, that is still showing up as a DART, and then a commission, so we're backing into something of a revenue per trade, correct? Jarrett Lilien - E*Trade Group Incorporated - President and COO That's right. Justin Hughes - Analyst - Jefferies & Co. Ok. Second of all, it seems like pricing is getting more and more competitive in that professional segment. Some people are going as low as a half a penny per share from some releases last week. I just am wondering, how competitive is that segment, and are you getting pricing pressure? Leonard Purkis - E*Trade Group Incorporated - CFO Well, that segment has been -- this is Len. That segment has been competitive for quite a while now. Particular pressure was on it as customers started to retreat from it in a weak market. We've actually seen a pretty significant pickup in volumes there and seen it strengthen a bit, so we're not overly concerned at this point. We think that we've got our cost structure right to price aggressively and very competitively in that business and intend to continue to grow market share there as well. 13 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Earnings Conference Call Justin Hughes - Analyst - Jefferies & Co. It does look like you grew some market share is compared to the trade station numbers yesterday. Is that what your numbers are telling you as well? Leonard Purkis - E*Trade Group Incorporated - CFO Yeah, and again, in keeping with the kind of things that we're saying moving into July, we feel very good about that entire space. Justin Hughes - Analyst - Jefferies & Co. Ok. Jarrett Lilien - E*Trade Group Incorporated - President and COO Part of it, Justin, I think you know this from having discussed this with them in the past. We wanted to clean that whole process up before we started including it in DART, because I think what you're really getting at is that we had a series of people or investors who were trading through us with respect to Tradescape, and our view was it was too competitive and not profitable, and so we have eliminated them from trading with us, and as a result, you know, you've seen some volatility in the transactions or DARTs coming from that group, but we're confident that now where we are, there's less pricing pressure and there will be more consistent growth in terms of quarter to quarter as you look at that segment. Justin Hughes - Analyst - Jefferies & Co. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from Nick Spar (inaudible) & Company. Nick Spar - Analyst - Shefel & Co. Hi, guys. Wonderful quarter. Question on cost-cutting. What round do you think you're in right now? You mentioned earlier on the call that obviously you're getting about $50 million this quarter. Have you put sort of a -- or have a goal for next year? Maybe give us some color on what items you think have the most fat to cut? Mitchell Caplan - E*Trade Group Incorporated - CEO We haven't really talked about next year yet so I'd rather hold back on that. But what I can tell you is, I think the most interesting way to look at it isn't necessarily fair to cut. Its that we are continuing to try to do things with respect to our back office operations and using technology to lower the cost of that process. So there are a couple ways in which we can look at that. The first is on the brokerage side of the house, we are about 80% of the way through the process of ensuring that we are on one platform across our entire brokerage segment. And, you know, so there's still more to do there in terms of lowering our cost. The next step is to be able to have the bank in that same exact position, and they're probably about 60%. So as we for example have added other businesses like our consumer finance business around marine and RV in Southern California, you want to integrate that and get that on one platform. The goal as we get through that and enter into 2004 would be in a position of trying to put all of that together on one global platform, which again we believe could add some significant cost savings, but probably the most important thing is, once 14 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Earnings Conference Call Jarrett and I and the team are through next quarter with respect to this last restructuring charge, we have no more charges contemplated after that, and it is entirely based on just continuing to look for these efficiencies through operations by leveraging technology. Leonard Purkis - E*Trade Group Incorporated - CFO And just adding a little bit too because the question has sort of been asked twice the same way, are there more efficiencies out there after this, and as Mitch said, you know, there's nothing that we see out there that's going to require a charge after this, but there are more efficiencies to get in the business, and we are doing some things in our back office, we're doing some things with technology. We're really putting together a lot of the operations between bank and broker, and there are other efficiencies that we've got on our agenda to find in the business and realize. Nick Spar - Analyst - Shefel & Co. Ok. Can you sort of you know, have you put a price target or a guess on you know once you've got one global platform, the efficiency, the (inaudible) you get from that? Leonard Purkis - E*Trade Group Incorporated - CFO No, we'll get that as we start to look at next year. Nick Spar - Analyst - Shefel & Co. All right. Thank you. Leonard Purkis - E*Trade Group Incorporated - CFO Absolutely. Operator Our next question is a follow-up from Richard Repetto from Putnam Lovell. Richard Repetto - Analyst - Putnam Lovell Securities Hi guys, first of all I want to correct myself if you that second half guidance is 28 to 33 if you would back out you know the 24 from the beginning. So the follow-up question, though, on this new mortgage on the move, I just want to see, can you give us a little bit more color? I know it's gotten a lot of publicity and a lot of attention out there, but can you give us some quantitative on the results that you've seen? Leonard Purkis - E*Trade Group Incorporated - CFO It's Len. It's too early to tell. I will give you a couple of bits of information, though, that I think you'll be happy with and we're very happy with. You know first of all, when we first did this, things like call volumes at the mortgage company increased by like 300%. Lead volume went up by 350%. And what we have found over time is, over the six weeks that it's been since we've launched this product, is there's been an incredible amount of interest in the product. But it's one of those because it's a purchase money product, it's something that takes longer time to ramp up. It's not like you make a decision and you close it. What I can tell you is that, you know, our daily prequalification letters for purchases, which is something that someone does when they're going out to buy a house, you know all of a sudden as a result went up by 75%. We're seeing really huge increases 15 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call throughout the mortgage company, and even if the product does okay, we've had the benefit of putting the mortgage company on the map. I mean, in this six-week period of time, we've had 500 media touches. I mean, this is being talked about in all circles, not only within other banks, but within bankers associations in the secondary market, we've had meetings with Fannie and Freddie and the bond market association talking about development of a secondary market, so it's still in its infancy, but we're really amazed by the pickup that we've felt in the mortgage company from it. Mitchell Caplan - E*Trade Group Incorporated - CEO Another thing to look at, Rich, it's interesting, I was talking to Matt Gearie (ph) who, as you know, runs the whole mortgage business and (inaudible) direct retail market recognitions. Matt's comment to me was we are just now beginning to see the impact of the mortgage on the move product in the last five or six days, because since Greenspan has been speaking and you see rates beginning to back up a little for the first time, you see the locks coming through because people recognize the value. So they're saying this may be the time when interest rates are going to start to rise and the value of this product is really relevant to me as opposed to thinking that mortgages will be declining. So it will be interesting to see the sort of volume that we experience in the next 10 or 12 or 15 days based on this volatility we've been seeing around rates in the marketplace. So, you know, a little bit more to come. The other thing which is interesting is a side note that Len really is touching on is that if you look at the drivers of profitability of the mortgage business, it's margins, and our margins have been pretty consistent in terms of what we're making on the sale of our direct to retail mortgage business, and the other is the cost of driving that business and as a result of the mortgage on the move, we've been in position where the PR has been so great that our cost of marketing to drive that volume had dropped significantly in the last 30 days and is helping drive some of the profitability at the mortgage company. So there's been sort of a side benefit, which Len is touching on that I don't think we expected to see when we began this process. Richard Repetto - Analyst - Putnam Lovell Securities Super. Thanks, guys. Leonard Purkis - E*Trade Group Incorporated - CFO Sure. Operator Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from Michael Vinciquerra of Raymond James. Michael Vinciquerra - Analyst - Raymond James & Associates Thank you. Two things. This is for Len on that portfolios that you bought, can you give us a little more detail on the credit card side? How is it structured? Did you simply buy some securities on the credit card side? Do you own the accounts, are you servicing those, that type of thing? Leonard Purkis - E*Trade Group Incorporated - CFO We actually bought the accounts. We can't disclose by virtue of our agreement who we bought them from. They're very high credit quality. They're a portfolio with just under $100 million, where we made sure we scrubbed through the entire thing that there are zero delinquencies upon our purchase. The weighted average FICO of the balances themselves are 705. The weighted average FICO of the accounts themselves, believe it or not, are 740, so as we develop the balances in these accounts which, what you're going to see is the weighted average FICOs go up, and these are 16 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Earnings Conference Call customers that we own. We bought them from a company that there was no other connection to the customer other than these accounts, so that we own the customer, and it's perfectly consistent with what we've been trying to do as a company, which is, you know, develop customers and then cross-sell them. So this is, you know, our first floor -- in a bigger sense. In addition, we are not doing the servicing on these. They're being serviced by the largest credit card servicer. Michael Vinciquerra - Analyst - Raymond James & Associates Ok. And I find it interesting, though, that the FICOs on these loans, which is a completely unscoored, is lower than all your secured loans in the auto and RV, but that's apaintly you're comfortable with the credit quality, so I'll take your word on that one. Leonard Purkis - E*Trade Group Incorporated - CFO Yes. Michael Vinciquerra - Analyst - Raymond James & Associates Last question is just for Lou on the market-making side, improvement in revenue capture in the period, I'm just curious, it looks like some of it must have come from the shift away from the bulletin board shares where you probably get much lower revenue capture if Knight's indication this afternoon was correct. Is that what's going on, or is there any other thing you see that could improve your revenue capture in market-making business in the future. Jarrett Lilien - E*Trade Group Incorporated - President and COO It's actually a couple of things. Clearly with the reengagement of the retail investor in the second quarter, we have seen additional volume, we've seen some additional volatility in the core stocks that we trade, the big listed and other over the counter names, so we would have had some lift as a result of that alone, but then you see that we report as well now the percentage of bulletin board stocks that we trade, and you're absolutely correct, as that mix changes, we get lift from that as well. I can't attribute really what percentage of the lift came from each one of these respectively, but they were both important. Bulletin boards are really a very small fraction of the revenue capture we get on larger listed over the counter stocks. Michael Vinciquerra - Analyst - Raymond James & Associates All right. Thank you. Operator Thank you. And our final question will be coming from Colin Clark of Merrill Lynch. Colin Clark - Analyst - Merrill Lynch Hi, guys. From what I understand, E*Trade's mortgage business has been -- has a fairly variable cost structure. I think that head count is somewhere around 500 employees, maybe more. Hypothetically, if mortgage revenues were to drop in half let's say by the first quarter of next year, how much and how fast could you reduce the mortgage cost base to offset that revenue decline? 17 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Earnings Conference Call Jarrett Lilien - E*Trade Group Incorporated - President and COO So let me give you a couple data points. The first is, the actual head count now is about 700, and if you look at in the realms of information that we are now providing you about the business from both a banking and brokerage and corporate side, you'll see one of the big areas of growth for us I think around head count is also considered in temporary and consultant or whatever. That really isn't consultant. It's really temporary help, and it is hiring exactly that, staffing up for the mortgage business. So that we are in a position of having that real variability. And, you know, Rob Bernaby (ph) and his team have been preparing for about 18 months, for a while, for about 18 months or longer for this inevitable period which is coming. It just hasn't come yet. And so they have plans in place, and they track exactly what's happening based on interest rates and staff up or down right now based on what's going on in the marketplace and their expectation would be to take the variable expenses which are probably 80% of their operating costs, and the more that we put their back office on the rest of the company, the more it becomes variable and just drop it based on the volume we're experiencing in the mortgage business. Mitchell Caplan - E*Trade Group Incorporated - CEO I'd sort of add to that too, you know, we've had a good learning experience on the brokerage side where we've seen things be very hot, you know, through 2002 and then cool off quite a bit, and we've been able to stay in front of that and actually grow profits in a period of declining margins. We're applying that learning to the mortgage company and already we spend a lot of time with the mortgage companies figuring out and contemplating what are the steps that we're going to take when things cool down so we are ahead of the game. And one of the things Len has touched on already, but one of the focuses is that shift from the refi to purchase money options, which is a part of the market that we're expecting to see continue to be pretty good, even as interest rates increase, and you and a product like mortgage on the move is, you know, a good example of something that we're already doing to prepare for that next part of the cycle. Leonard Purkis - E*Trade Group Incorporated - CFO And just one last thing is that we're also able to move, as interest rates rise and the main first mortgage markets slow down because of refis, that's also a time when typically you'd expect to see home equity loans ib increase, so that we can simply move certain groups of people from the first mortgage desk over to the home equity desk. In addition, we'll be co-locating the mortgage business with the Janus boat and RV business later in the year, and when we do that, there will also be some natural synergies between the companies that when things slow down, we can move people over from one part of the business to the other. Colin Clark - Analyst - Merrill Lynch Great. Then just one follow-up to that. What percent of your origination business is purchase versus refi at present? Leonard Purkis - E*Trade Group Incorporated - CFO It's been about consistently and remains about 10% refi -- 10% purchase. I'm sorry. Right now. But I will tell you that even though it's been consistently around 10%, our purchase volume generated by the mortgage company almost doubled in quarter 2 over quarter 1. So that's part of our strategy to ramp that part of the business up. It's masked in terms of percentage just because the volume is to great, but in terms of the absolute numbers, they're definitely moving the way we'd like to see them. Colin Clark - Analyst - Merrill Lynch Ok. Great. Thanks. 18 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

At this time I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded and that all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the request of the Company, we will open the conference up for questions and answers after the presentation. Joining us today from the company is Mr. John Kelley. I will now turn the conference over to you Mr. Kelley, please go ahead. John Kelley - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - VP of Investor Relations Thank you. Good afternoon this is John Kelley. With me are Allen Doane, President and CEO of Alexander & Baldwin; and Jim Andrasick, who is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of A&B as well as President and Chief Executive Officer of Matson Navigation Company. Following the introduction, Allen will give an overview and an outlook commentary; Jim will comment on progress at Matson and some of the financial matters. I'll give a quick summary about some economic statistics and then as the operator said we'll open for questions. I want to thank everyone for participating, if anyone is having trouble hearing, you should hit "*" "0" and the operator will help you. Professional investor invitees on the call should have received e-mail or fax call reminder and the earnings release and copies to the release is also available on our website, and replay is available both on the web and using the calling numbers on the invitation for one week. We are happy to take individual calls later. We do have to note there is a 6 hour time difference with Eastern Daylight time at this time of the year. Statements on the call are set forth our expectations and predictions based on facts and the situations that are known to us as of today July 25th, 2003. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties such as those we described on page 19 of the Form 10-K and our 2002 Annual Report, and I'd remind listeners of our website www.alexanderbaldwin.com and its links to our subsidiaries for supplementary information. With that I would like to return the call over Allen Doane. Allen. Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - President and CEO Thank you John. We are going to take a little different approach today in a couple ways. First the initial commentary will be reduced from approximately 30 minutes to less then 20 and it's going to be little more focused on some of the future looking elements of the business relative to some new investments. I would characterize the second quarter results as excellent. Matson was up 67% of a somewhat suppressed 2002. Our leasing income was up 18% in the quarter year-over-year and that was a record quarter, and overall net our income was up 83%. What I would like to do is focus on the real estate business today and some other projects that we're involved in; some recent announcement that have been made relative to these projects and than I'll ask Jim Andrasick to comment on Matson. 2 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

JULY 25, 2003 / 7:00PM, - Q2 2003 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Jim has accepted on a permanent basis the position of President and CEO of Matson. Jim has done an outstanding job with Matson, and I am confident that he will continue to excel in this key position. On interim basis he will continue as the A&B CFO as we are evaluating replacement candidates. So if I could for a couple of minutes, I am going to focus on real estate and give you some idea about where we are and we are going. First just quickly on the leasing segment, our income is up quite nicely -- 18%, assets are up about 9% year over year in the quarter, so you can kind of figure out what's investment growth and what is income growth excluding investment growth. Notable that we've a got a 96% occupancy on the mainland versus 91% last year, 90% in Hawaii versus 87% last year; this is the first time that I can remember in quite a while that we've had both elements of our commercial portfolio have a 9 on the first digit. The one major sale transaction we had in the quarter, which did not show up in the leasing segment but shows up in our property or management and sales activity segment, is a shopping center Arino; it's kind of a standard story for us, we buy it, we own it for a while, when it's time to sell we sell, we sold and achieved the gains little more than $6m on the sale, and this was just a good transaction overall. We had owned it for seven something years so that's also kind of a standard length of time for us usually anywhere from 3-5-7 years, and then we will move to something else. We expect to re-invest the proceeds from the sale in other property investments on a tax-deferred basis. The most important things that are going on in the real estate part of the company are -- really don't show in the income statement. Let me bring you up-to-date on just a couple of these. The first is the Hokua project that is a luxury high rise condominium in Honolulu to be built where the principal developers were in the partnership with some Hawaii developers on this. We put in $40m, the total of 50m in equity. We've just secured the loan to begin the project. We expect to break around before year end, 247 units; 230 plus have been sold on non-binding contracts, average price $1.1m. Second project [Lanakeia]. You may not remember the name but that is luxury -- sub-luxury high rise condominium project in Waikiki that we are developing on our own, 100 units. First high rise development in Waikiki since the early 1990s. Of the 100 units, 89 have been sold on a nonbinding contractual basis. The average price here is $558,000. We expect to begin site work early as October. Third project, Kukuiula that is our 1000 acre master plan community resort on the southern part of Kauai. We have a partner in this project DMB Associates from Arizona; they are a very reputable, very, very accomplished upscale developer for master plan communities. We are engaged in a re-entitlement process right now with them assisting us. There really were two steps we had to go through the first which was the state, the second was the county. I am pleased to report that on July 10, on a first reading basis that we are able to have the state Land Use Commission approve the project on a 6-0 vote. So we are into the county in now for zoning that could take about a year but you never know, 1500 units life style development golf course center. This is a sustainable income project for more than a decade with a highly reputable partner. The last project and the one that is most current in terms of having just been announced this week is the acquisition or I might say the re-acquisition of Wailea on Maui. A&B had been the initial developer of this premier resort in the early 1970s, sold it in the late 1980s, and we are now in a position we have a contract to acquire it for a $135m, three superb golf courses on Maui, two golf courses on Kauai. Our focus is 270 fully zoned undeveloped acres within the Wailea resort; this is what you would call infill development activity. Many of you I know have been to Wailea and know how extraordinary the location is. We do have a partner on this transaction, he is a well known and successful golf course owner, and he is a developer from Canada, Mr. Caleb Chan and we'll be in a position in a future of date to announce the nature of our relationship with him on this transaction. This is a second what you would call a ten year plus development investment with attractive -- potentially very attractive returns for the company. Just a couple of final comments moving away now from real estate. On the Ag side record yield we had some factory constraints. We don't expect the second half of the year in our food product segment to be as good as last year's second half but we are doing okay. Matson symbolically, significantly christened last week, the -- our first new ship to join Matson's Hawaii Service since 1992, we were honored that Mrs. Margaret Inouye, wife of Senator Daniel Inouye christen the ship and with that Jim will provide more details on Matson, and on the new vessels, and some other matters.

JULY 25, 2003 / 7:00PM, - Q2 2003 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call James Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - CFO and EVP, President and CEO of Matson Thank you very much Allen and I remind you that -- you made a forward-looking statement in saying that I will continue to excel as the President and Chairman of Matson--. Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - President and CEO I think, I said I expect you continue to excel. James Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - CFO and EVP, President and CEO of Matson Well with that it is certainly an honor to have that position. We have had a good recovery at Matson not just in the core Hawaii business but also in our affiliate performance which includes joint ventures in Scuba Diving on the West Coast and an operation in Puerto Rico and that really has driven large part of our year-over-year improvement. But much of that was revenue driven. Revenues were up 13% in Matson Navigation for the second quarter and up 18% in our intermodal service, and of course, the operating profit rose to 23m, up nearly 10m from a year ago, and underlying this recovery was a thing we talked about many times, much improved performance at our Kent Island terminal. This is our [inaudible] terminal in a way, one of the parameters we use is moves per hour at the dock side, the containers going either on or off] ships per hour. We averaged 22 moves per hour in the second quarter and that compared to 20 in the first quarter; and about 18 during the entire first half of 2002. Well this is getting closer to our objectives; it's kind of like your golf store, it's easy to go from 120 to 95 and then the next 10 strokes is much more difficult, and that's the stage we are at, at Kent Island. Our vessel schedule integrity also improved greatly, we're running 8 ships currently and on time performances are much better than the first quarter and of course tremendously improved from the fourth quarter of last year during very disruptive times on the West coast. Several other items, last call, we talked about the new vessels and whether the company intended to own them or at lease or time charter them, I'm pleased to report that the negotiations with Matson's offshore unions tipped the scale that favored outright ownership. So we have made that decision, and the financing for the first vessel is not yet in place, but it is committed. It will take the form of 55m in title 11 government guaranteed bonds, and 55m from our capital construction fund at Matson. Delivery, I believe, we can now assume will be late third quarter and actually sea trials begin this Sunday at 06:00. Another major strategy I wanted to comment on was vehicle handling. The company handled during the first half of this year record number of vehicles of to and from Hawaii from the West Coast and this caused us to revisit our strategy for carriage of those vehicles. Right now, we are 25% of our capacity is what's called roll-on and roll-off, which is really the preferred method of carrying cars and other rolling stock, and that we had made a strategic decision to increase that to 75%. And as a part of that strategy have chartered in, effective the fourth quarter of this year, a [row row] vessel from the third party and dedicated terminals will be established in both Oakland and Honolulu to service his new strategy with direct hauls to Maui as well. We hope to start that service early in the fourth quarter of this year and in connection with the Matson -- my appointment we have also reorganized the Executive Management of Matson effective August 1 with the right people in the right places for the next 18-24 months. So, morale I think is, you can say is very high at the moment and will continue to be and we look forward to really good things. I'd like to just refer in my closing comments on the financial side of it to the industry segment data on page 7. And the corporate expense line is something we often have commented on in the past. For the first half of the year, we're up $2m from $6.2-8.2. That does not reflect any change in headcount at the corporate level. It is more a reflection of rising health benefit cost, our pension accounting effects some of them at least, outside service fees relating to audits and insurance in particular. And other such elements of expense. Also you can see that our interest expense continues to decline or driven by rates. And on the cash flow and the balance sheet side, I'd just like to make a couple of quick comments, because really there -- on page 8 in the balance sheets, the current assets get increased and cash balances at Matson at the end of the second quarter were about $14m versus nothing at the end of the '02. We also had a land transfer during the first quarter 4 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

JULY 25, 2003 / 7:00PM, - Q2 2003 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call of [Ueiua] lands owned by A&B in the amount of about $28m. And that accounts for all of the decline in real state development and all of the increase in our investment accounts. [Let's] transfer this clip from one asset category to another. And finally our current liability accounts did increase taxes payable on outstand. We had cool dividends -- A&B dividends is about 9m. Because of the timing of those dividends is not yet posted at year end 2002. Our cash flow is very strong for the 6 months. Operating sources generated over 61m and compared to the last year where we had some very significant tax payments on the sale of the securities in 2001. We -- that did not reoccur. So, the combination of those two factors greatly improved the company's cash flow which allowed us to repay a small amount of debt, maintain normal dividend payments, and I'm pleased to say that the condition -- natural condition of the company remains very solid and very stable. With that I would like to turn it over to John Kelley who I believe will report on some Hawaii economic indicators. John. John Kelley - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - VP of Investor Relations Thanks Jim. The state's economy is performing reasonably well to date. There has been active growth in construction and real estate offsetting short-term what I would attribute to SARS-related weakness in the international travel, but I do have to note that we are still well below peak visitor travel levels. This month the State Forecasting Agency raised its estimate of real gross state products to about 2% for this year versus 1.7% that they had forecast couple of months ago so a modest increase there. This morning, personal incomes were reported nationally and such for the state's Hawaii did rather well. Comparing first quarters, the US number was up 3.4%, Hawaii was up 5.5 to [meet] at the third fastest growth rate in the US, and comparing the first quarter of this year to fourth quarter of last, the US number was about 1% and Hawaii was up to 2%. But there is some good potential there. In the all important visitor industry year-to-date through June total visitor arrivals are down about 1.5% and the trends we've talked about before hold the US visitors were up about 3% and that represents almost three quarters of the market whereas international visitors are down 11. But because of the longer stays in the Islands by both segments the visitor days measure which is rather important from an economic point of view -- total was up about 6% with the US again leading up 9% and the international down 5. Now since June and changing the measurement basis just a bit in July there was some, rather steady improvement day-by-day on both the domestic side and in this case measuring Japanese arrivals but again there comparing against a rather soft calendar year '02 with the total as now just a little bit above '02 levels. For the year, the outlook forecast is about 6.5m visitors, up one-half or 1% and that compares with almost 7m, the peak that was set in calendar year 2000. The active sector that is offsetting the weakness in visitors is in construction and a couple of quick measures there in the first quarter is the contracting tax pays, which is a proxy for current activity was up 23% on our quarter-to-quarter basis. Jobs in the construction industry were up 9%. And then looking forward, total private building authorizations in the first quarter doubled, and that was led by activity in commercial, industrial, and followed just slightly behind by residential and there was a small offset in government where some fiscal constraints are setting in as in many states. In the first quarter 547 new residential units -- single-family residential units were authorized, that was a 65% increase and about 300 multi-family units were authorized, that were a very substantial increase but it is pretty volatile number as you can imagine multi-family units come in large blocks. A lot of this is driven by residential sales, which continue to be very active, and just looking at Oahu through June residential sales volume in dollar value is up 32% from the first half of the last year and single-family home prices are back to the levels -- the high levels that were set in the 1990 boom period. And on new homes we're beginning to see some supply constraints, but new home sales in the first half were up 38%. All of this activity helps offset the weakness in international visitors and the still relatively modest level of total visitors. Operator with that I'd like to close the formal presentation and open it to Q and A. 5 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

JULY 25, 2003 / 7:00PM, - Q2 2003 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Operator Thank you. The question and answer session will begin at this time. If you are using a speakerphone please pick up the handset before pressing any numbers. Should you have a question please press "*" "1" on your pushbutton telephone; if you wish to withdraw your question please press "*" "2". Your questions will be taken in the order that they are received. Please standby for your first question. Our first question comes from Jamelah Leddy from McAdams Wright and Ragen, please go ahead. Jamelah Leddy - McAdams Wright and Ragen - Analyst Thank you I have a couple of questions. With respect to the terminal improvements at Kent Island, I was wondering if you would give the number of moves per hour that you are currently achieving along the west coast and may be also for the company overall? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - President and CEO I am going to ask Jim to do that, its west coast moves per hour Jim. James Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - CFO and EVP, President and CEO of Matson Those generally trend higher than the Hawaiian moves for a lot of different reasons, but right now they are -- it's about 24.5 is my recollection. Jamelah Leddy - McAdams Wright and Ragen - Analyst Okay, and for the Company overall, would that just be an average between the two or is it more skewed towards the West Coast? James Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - CFO and EVP, President and CEO of Matson No, that is the West Coast. The Hawaii moves per hour at Kent Island have averaged 22 for the last -- during the last 3 months. Jamelah Leddy - McAdams Wright and Ragen - Analyst Right, but I am asking this for the Company overall, the total company, is it just --? James Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - CFO and EVP, President and CEO of Matson We don't really measure it that way but -- Jamelah Leddy - McAdams Wright and Ragen - Analyst Okay. James Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - CFO and EVP, President and CEO of Matson I guess if you took a simple average it would probably be pretty close. 6 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

JULY 25, 2003 / 7:00PM, - Q2 2003 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Jamelah Leddy - McAdams Wright and Ragen - Analyst Okay. In your press release your guidance was may be a little bit more conservative than I would have thought. You had talked about tough quarterly comparisons in the back half of this year and I was thinking that the ocean transportation margins were down in the fourth quarter last year due to the port strike and I would imagine that would certainly have been easier comparison, and with a new improved vessel and economic conditions improving in Hawaii, it seems hard for me to believe that its really going to be that difficult -- and I guess I am wondering do you really have concerns that EPS will decline year-over-year in Q3 and Q4 and I know you don't give specific guidance, but that's sort of how I read your statement in the press release? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - President and CEO We're at a mode here where providing very specific guidance just doesn't to make a lot of sense to us on many different levels. Where -- we have done very, very well on the quarter, we've have got good momentum right now, we really have already achieved most of our objectives for the year in our property sales area, but not all of them. Though we are not going to take what we've got in our property development and management sales area and then come in and put two times on that one. Jamelah Leddy - McAdams Wright and Ragen - Analyst Okay. Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - President and CEO So and then the other item just in terms of general direction, and I think, we've been pretty specific on that as we had unusually strong second half in food products last year and we know that we are not going to lap that one and that's why we were specific as we were. Where we do expect to have a pretty good second half in ocean transportation -- Jamelah Leddy - McAdams Wright and Ragen - Analyst Okay. Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - President and CEO -- compared to last year and exactly how good, we are not in a position to say, but we do expect as you are asking in general terms to have a good second half in ocean transportation, a good second half in leasing. Sales, we have done most of what we want to do and need to do already for this year, but you never what's going to happen there. Jamelah Leddy - McAdams Wright and Ragen - Analyst Okay. Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - President and CEO And then we have talked about food products. 7 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

JULY 25, 2003 / 7:00PM, - Q2 2003 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Jamelah Leddy - McAdams Wright and Ragen - Analyst Okay, great. And can you talk about how are margins compared on some of your new larger joint venture projects with other real estate margins? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - President and CEO Yes, we, you know, it's business where -- because it's not an operating business we generally look at it on a return on capital, particularly, an IRR basis and the margins that we are seeing in general and the returns that we are expecting are ones that I would characterize -- as quite attractive. There is a range, the development margins and profitability by virtue of the additional risk that you are taking should be and generally are higher than they are in some of the more secured segments of our business, but you know, we've underwritten the projects that I highlighted today. The high-rises and Wailea and our Kukui'Ula venture. We are expecting some pretty dog on good performance in those. Jamelah Leddy - McAdams Wright and Ragen - Analyst Thanks. Great. I have some more questions. But, I will go back into queue and let other people have a chance. Thanks. Operator Our next question gentlemen, comes from Nichol Abele from Karis Company. Please state your question. Nichol Abele - Karis Company - Analyst Good afternoon gentlemen. Congratulations on the good quarter. My first question is for Jim with respect to the revisiting strategy on the vehicle handling, going from 25% capacity to 75% capacity on roll-on roll-off. Can you just quickly comment on the cause for the change in strategy and what the implications as might be going forward? James Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - CFO and EVP, President and CEO of Matson Certainly, one of the causes is what we feel is increased demand and the business - for the major automobile manufactures who make up a good bulk of a customer base here and incidences of damages is a very big concern. And, when we are as we have in the past stuffing cars in and out of containers using different racking systems as well as some roll-on, roll-off capacity that we stuffed into our liner vessels, it has been increasingly hard to meet those quality standards. So, I think it is a customer driven strategy change, and a volume, in order to accommodate the increased volume that we see that goes along with the growth in the Hawaii economy we [have decided] to increase our capacity. So, it seems like a really opportune of time to take these actions actions. The implications are -- our customers will be happier; I would hope. And that we would actually enjoy some cost savings as a result of the greater efficiency involved in roll-on, roll-off of carriage of vehicles, which is pretty much the international standard that involves the carriage of automobiles and rolling stock. There is an investment involved and I think the ability for the company to realize a financial benefit from this beyond improving our customer service will be eliminating or displacing one of our existing liner vessels in the Hawaii trade either in part or entirely and -- it remains to be seen that how successful we are in implementing all this, but it's a major undertaking by the company and -- we -- as I said here earlier we expect to begin the service in the fourth quarter. Nichol Abele - Karis Company - Analyst Do you have any guidance for the quantitative number for the cost savings? 8 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

JULY 25, 2003 / 7:00PM, - Q2 2003 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call James Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - CFO and EVP, President and CEO of Matson No. I really can't provide that at this time. Nichol Abele - Karis Company - Analyst Okay. Just moving along, international visit soft again down 11%. What is going to be the factor to turn this around and what is actually holding it up? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - President and CEO Well you know there've been all kinds of onetime factors, first 9/11 and then SARS. There's some underlying economic issues in Japan, that's really the principal supplier of international visitors to Hawaii. We get a lot of different signals, on where the Japanese travelers intend to go, but, you know, I would expect that over time as some of these concerns and fears start to subside that we will begin to see a recovery with the Japanese visitor count. It's been pretty -- if you go back and you look at the perspective of the last couple of years, it's been actually pretty amazing that we've held up the way we have, because there has been -- not just this past year, but if you look at compared to 3 or 4 years ago, we have really had a pretty dramatic drop. And I would underline the word dramatic in the Japanese visitor count in Hawaii and that's pretty much been all offset by visitors coming from the mainland US. So the resiliency of this market over a period of several years has actually surprised me. Nichol Abele - Karis Company - Analyst Okay. And then just one more quick question with respect to the inter-modal division. Another good quarter for this division on the back of increased customer volumes. What is actually driving this and is it sustainable going forward? James Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - CFO and EVP, President and CEO of Matson Two factors. One is, I guess, industry wide demand is up along with the economy post 9/11 recovery generally speaking. That's increased the customers' needs for intermodal service. I would say the other factor is just picking up additional geographic areas through selective hiring of brokers and agents and that's I believe the combination of the two was what was you're striving at the revenue line. [We did do] -- as I'd reported earlier we had new leadership at Matson intermodal and [Bob Patworth], and we expect to have bigger things in the future either through continued geographic growth or perhaps selected acquisition and would put us into new area. Nichol Abele - Karis Company - Analyst Okay perfect. Al right. Thanks a lot guys. Congratulations. James Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - CFO and EVP, President and CEO of Matson Thank you. Operator Thank you our next comes from Tom Spyrow from Spyrow Capital. Please state your question. 9 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

JULY 25, 2003 / 7:00PM, - Q2 2003 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Tom Spyrow - Spyrow Capital - Analyst First on Matson we have new vessel that will be placed in service soon enough. I wonder if you could help us better understand what that means from an earnings stand point and a cash flow stand point? James Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - CFO and EVP, President and CEO of Matson I can give you a broad description of kind of where we are with the vessels. We've had some relatively good results and I would -- while I go when we were looking at these vessels, two new vessels the description was that it was going to have some dilutive effect. I would say now that the dilutive effect is going to be minimal and that is progress why the change; there really are a couple of factors; one is that we were able to achieve as Jim, had indicated earlier the source of operating cost savings that were necessary to man these vessels. And that really had been expected when we first got -- made the investment. The other thing is that our financing is turning out to be more favorable than we had originally anticipated and the combination of those two factors has made it a better investment for the company. You really have to look at this as a replacement strategy. We've got an average fleet that is getting up there in years. And it is harder to quantify at times, some of the savings you get with less breakdowns, less repair and maintenance, but all those things have a way of creeping into the P&L line, but not necessarily in any one quarter. So, I would just say that the overall view now that we have on these two vessels is certainly better than when we made the initial investment. Tom Spyrow - Spyrow Capital - Analyst And from the cash flow standpoint, I would presume that the depreciation resulting from a new vessel will exceed to whatever depreciation we still have been taking on the old vessel -- the depreciation here for book purposes? James Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - CFO and EVP, President and CEO of Matson You can be assured of that. Tom Spyrow - Spyrow Capital - Analyst Yes. That's great. On the -- just to go back to the [row row] vessel discussion from a moment, that I understand you folks to be saying that you expect that once you've got the [row row] vessel in service. You'll take one of our older liner vessels out of service. James Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - CFO and EVP, President and CEO of Matson That was -- yes that would stand to reason because a lot of older are currently shipped in containers or border liner vessels to the extent they are displaced we'll have available capacity and if demand is not there to justify -an eight liner vessels configuration it will be adjusted as well, this is the likely result. Tom Spyrow - Spyrow Capital - Analyst Just go back to the newly purchased vessel for one second. The financing, you've mentioned the $55m coming out of the CCF, I guess the balance sheet change will see -- it will be the CCF line item decreased by a $55m. We will have a debt of $50 some odd million and we'll have the new vessel on the balance sheet as well. 10 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

JULY 25, 2003 / 7:00PM, - Q2 2003 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call James Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - CFO and EVP, President and CEO of Matson It's exactly correct. Tom Spyrow - Spyrow Capital - Analyst Okay. The acquisition from Shinwa, how could that come about and what's the genesis of that? It's kind of unusual that we -- I guess sold them some fraction of that years ago and now they are selling it back to us. Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - President and CEO Yes, it really is unusual. It's -- I believe that they were in a position that this was a regulated sale through that -- the agency -- RCC in Japan that oversees that type of the activity. This was a competitive process, which is not normally the case for the investments that we have made, so this was the process that involved a number of different parties putting in a bit, and we for reasons that probably or somewhat understandable and may be a few that are less discernible. We were able to prevail. Tom Spyrow - Spyrow Capital - Analyst I guess the transaction is going to be diluted for some period of time. Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - President and CEO I won't say that. Tom Spyrow - Spyrow Capital - Analyst You would not? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - President and CEO No. Tom Spyrow - Spyrow Capital - Analyst Okay. Lastly let just me echo --. Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - President and CEO Let me -- I don't want to change what I said, but for some period of time -- there may be a short period of time, but I would not expect us to be a lengthy dilutive investment at all. And you'll learn more about it as we -- as the ownership is transferred, we will be a lot more specific, but I would not be concerned that this is going to be a dilutive investment. Tom Spyrow - Spyrow Capital - Analyst Great. Lastly, let me just echo a comment that an earlier caller made with respect to your caution that the second half looks particularly a challenging and I am withstanding your comments about Ag and property sales, I guess, I am still scratching my head a little bit to find -- to figure out what 11 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

JULY 25, 2003 / 7:00PM, - Q2 2003 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call exactly those challenges are. It would seem that second half last year was a particularly tough one for Matson and since that's such a central part of the company, and we are entering the second half with so much momentum there. I'm still a little puzzle as to why the second half looks like a challenge. Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - President and CEO Well --. Tom Spyrow - Spyrow Capital - Analyst Are there other particular problems we should think about? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - President and CEO Yes. Number one, I was born conservative in terms of making statements -- I apologize for that personal characteristic. But now as I was suggesting, we are going to have. Okay, third quarter last and fourth quarter is where we started this life, so was that exactly all of the year, but we expect to have a pretty good second half in ocean transportation. We are going to have a really good year and are having a good year in our property area, the only area where publicly suggesting caution is on the food products area where we earned an unusually large amount of money in the second half of last year. James Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - CFO and EVP, President and CEO of Matson $10m to be exact. Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - President and CEO Yes. So we are not going to earn $10m in food products in the second half of this year. Tom Spyrow - Spyrow Capital - Analyst Thanks a lot; and I'll get back in queue. Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - President and CEO Okay. Operator Our next question comes from Stewart Scharf from Standard & Poor's, please state your question. Stewart Scharf - Standard and Poor's - Analyst Hi, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the fuel prices and surcharge and where you see that going? 12 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

JULY 25, 2003 / 7:00PM, - Q2 2003 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - President and CEO I will make a brief comment then I'll have Jim elaborate on it. We have -- the objective of the fuel surcharge is not to have it either as a benefit to the company or to in the flip side to have fuel prices be a detriment to the company, and unlike some other transportation businesses, we are seemingly able to neutralize the effect of changes in the cost of oil. You know, you've got oil trading still about $30 a barrel, our fuel surcharge is what 6.5% right now, we lowered it several months ago but it's probably where it's going to be for a period of time. The broader prospective story on this is that we do have a mechanism in place that on an equitable basis does allow us to offset the changes and it works. Jim? James Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - CFO and EVP, President and CEO of Matson I would just add Allen that this is a residual fuel market mostly in West Coast and to the extent the you have refinery disruptions or anything of that sort, highly seasonal, and the prices I am just looking at them now for references really been quite volatile from one week to the next, but it's averaged down about for June almost $28 barrel, which isn't that much different than March, you know, during the period one when all the crude oil prices are trending higher. So, we have made I think the appropriate adjustments, and I just would echo what Allen said this is a -- just a pass through on Matson's half to his customers of ups and downs in fuel cost and we do not hedge fuel. I don't believe our competitors do either. Just for this reason, we have a natural hedge in the fuel surcharge. Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - President and CEO But when the price goes down and it is down on a sustained basis, we are also going to drop the surcharge because we have to maintain our credibility in the marketplace. Stewart Scharf - Standard and Poor's - Analyst And you still have the same amount of repurchase program in place, [do you] plan to utilize that at any point -- 1m shares? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - President and CEO Yes, we have a stock repurchase authorization that is still in place for 2m shares. Stewart Scharf - Standard and Poor's - Analyst It is 2m shares? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - President and CEO Yes. Stewart Scharf - Standard and Poor's - Analyst Total, okay. Was 1m added or placed - one point? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - President and CEO That is right [inaudible]. 13 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

JULY 25, 2003 / 7:00PM, - Q2 2003 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Stewart Scharf - Standard and Poor's - Analyst Okay. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamelah Leddy from McAdams Wright Ragen. Please state your question. Jamelah Leddy - McAdams Wright and Ragen - Analyst Thank you. On the shipping side I am wondering if you see any opportunities for potential price increases or if you can, sort of, comment about the current situation there? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - President and CEO Jim, why don't you go first and I will come in second on that one? James Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - CFO and EVP, President and CEO of Matson Normally, we don't comment on future pricing actions but [serve it] to say that the company instituted a terminal handling charge earlier in the year to partially reflect the known increases in cost from the labor settlement from -- earlier this year and beyond that fuel surcharge movements up and down. In this case down has been the only pricing activity in our business. Jamelah Leddy - McAdams Wright and Ragen - Analyst Is that--. Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - President and CEO Don't need to add to that. Jamelah Leddy - McAdams Wright and Ragen - Analyst Okay. Do you have any indication directionally about container volume demands going into the third quarter? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - President and CEO Well, it's relatively stable right now. Autos are still at a pretty high level, but some of the major -- as we indicated in our last quarterly call we saw pretty a big bump in the first quarter -- container volume on a year-over-year basis; we did not expect it to be significant at all in the second quarter and you saw the result, and the third quarter trend could be somewhat similar. Jamelah Leddy - McAdams Wright and Ragen - Analyst Okay. And I did notice that you've paid down a little bit of debt since the end of the first quarter. Do you have any goals or targets and I know there are a lot of factors that go into your debt levels but have you restated anything as far as the targets? 14 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

JULY 25, 2003 / 7:00PM, - Q2 2003 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call James Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - CFO and EVP, President and CEO of Matson No we haven't -- especially given all of the real estate activity that Allen enumerated at the beginning of the call. It has been a fluid situation from a treasury point of view. The Company does have substantial lines of credit that are unutilized at the moment, and our debt-to-equity ratio remains very low at about 26% --excuse me debt-to-capital ratio. Jamelah Leddy - McAdams Wright and Ragen - Analyst Okay thanks a lot. Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - President and CEO Thank you. Operator Thank you. We have a follow-up question from Tom Spyrow from Spyrow Capital. Please state your question. Tom Spyrow - Spyrow Capital - Analyst Apart from the Shinwa acquisition what's the CAPEX budget for the second half? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - President and CEO We -- when you strip out the vessel purchase and then you take out the Shinwa acquisition we've got relatively, I would call it, a modest capital budget for the second half of the year Tom. Tom Spyrow - Spyrow Capital - Analyst And I would guess that at least some of Shinwa would be financed with debt? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - President and CEO We will be in a position to describe that transaction to you when we close it. I think you will find it to be a very interesting approach. Tom Spyrow - Spyrow Capital - Analyst Overall on the shipping side over the last couple of 3 years, we've heard of about the various competitors --prospective competitors who may come into the market at some point, where do those folks stand these days in their plans to get into this market? James Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - CFO and EVP, President and CEO of Matson I'll respond to that Tom, it's Jim. There really were Two that have been public in their intentions -- one is called [Santa Maria] with a couple of individual who are putting together start up operations -- they presently do on own at any ships nor do they have under contracts to build any ships. So most recently there was some news report out of Pacific North-west that they have been in discussions with one of the local shipyards 15 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

JULY 25, 2003 / 7:00PM, - Q2 2003 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call there about building two or perhaps more of the smaller vessels that would make direct calls to the neighbor islands and so forth. As far as anything tangible happening I am not aware of it. Regarding the other prospective competitor and that was Pacia Hawaii transport lines, which is a joint venture between Pacia and Van Ommeron. Those plans were put on hold when the shipyard that was constructing the pure car carrier went chapter 11. Construction -- it has been reported construction has resumed within the past month or so on that vessel and then Matson obviously has an interest in either utilizing that vessel in collaboration with this new venture or on its own. The discussions have been underway and continue on proper rationalization of the trade. But that's all we know at this point in time on those two developments. Tom Spyrow - Spyrow Capital - Analyst Thanks a lot and good luck. James Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin Inc. - CFO and EVP, President and CEO of Matson Thank you Tom. Operator Thank you. I'd like to remind you if you have a question please press "*" "1" on your pushbutton phone. Mr. Kelley I am showing no further questions at this time.

We would like to welcome you to the Office Depot Second Quarter 2003 Earnings Conference Call. All lines will be on listen-only mode for today's presentation, after which instructions will be given in order to ask a question. At the request of Office Depot, today's conference is being recorded. I would like to introduce Ms. Eileen Dunn, Vice President of investor relations and public relations, who will make a few opening comments. Ms. Dunn, you may now begin. Eileen Dunn Good morning every one. Before we begin today's call, I'd like to remind you that certain of the statement made on this call are forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Except for any historical, financial, and business performance information, comments made on this call should be considered forward-looking. Actual future results may differ materially from those discussed on this call due to risks and uncertainties, both foreseen and unforeseen.

During this call, our CEO, Bruce Nelson, will refer the results of our second quarter, which should not reflect the adoption of EITF 02-16 and therefore are non-GAAP numbers. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP numbers to GAAP results can be found on our website at www.officedepot.com. Now, I would like to introduce Office Depot's Chairman and CEO, Bruce Nelson. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman and CEO Thanks Eileen and good morning to all of you from beautiful downtown Delray Beach, Florida, where I am joined with my management team and later on I will have Charlie Brown, our EVP and CFO add some comments on our quarter. First, to give you kind of a recap of the quarter; GAAP EPS was 19 cents. We had significant improvement in our North American retail comps. We have said all along in the first quarter that I thought comps would [bottom and they did. We saw sequential improvements throughout the quarter. And in fact, June was slightly positive in our North American stores and we are optimistic about the future. Our North American contract business grew 5%. We said we would focus on large account growth 2 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call and we are getting it. That growth is somewhat mitigated by softness in our Office Depot catalog business, which continues, but that too, we believe, will get better as the year progresses. We did complete the acquisition of Guilbert. We do have one month of June Guilbert's activities in this quarter. By the way, just from that prospective, it was a $121m of revenue and we will, at the end of the call, give you considerable more insight into Guilbert, what we found since we completed the acquisition on June 2, and more insight to next year. We had a number of major achievements in the second quarter and not the least of which as we completed three new significant merchandizing issues. The rollout of Office Depot and virtually all of our stores were the major undertaking of our stores group and they did it flawlessly. We also completed major re-plan-o-grams in writing instruments and binders, both important categories to Office Depot and our business customers and we're beginning to see the results of those activities. We opened our first Millennium store just out side of Atlanta, Georgia, in Marietta. We're excited about the early results of that store. We plan on 23-28 of those by the end of the year. This is a remodel format and we believe we can make this model work and go into 2004 with a remodeling program that will significantly improve some of our older stores. Our global e-commerce leadership position continues to grow. On a worldwide basis, global e-commerce sales increased 22%, domestically a 16% increase, internationally a 136% increase. We now have 32 sites -- global e-commerce sites around the world including the industry's first [old] Hispanic North American site. As I said, we completed our Guilbert transaction and we opened four retail stores in Madrid, Spain, even if the total five as we launched retail in the first quarter of this year -- in the first half of this year. On a consolidated sales basis, sales improved by 7% in the second quarter; 4% for the first six months. Sales increases in BSG, e-commerce, and international including some impact from -- positive impact from European exchange rate transactions, more than offset the negative 3% retail comps in North America. Comparable sales were down 1% worldwide for the quarter, down 2% for the year. As I commented earlier, we continue to gain leadership position on our e-commerce side. On an operating profit basis and now as you recall, Eileen said, I would make comments excluding the impact of EITF so that you get a more comparable look at our business, quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year. So, my remarks going forward now will exclude EITF, as Eileen said, both on our website and in the detailed release, you can get the reconciliation to these numbers. But, [ex] -- we have a change of accounting for the vendor EITF, consolidate gross margins were down 34 basis points from last year. Operating expenses were up slightly by 27 basis points and as a result consolidated operating profit was down 61 basis points year-over-year in the quarter. Second quarter operating profit reflects negative comps and gross margins declines in North American retail, which will -- I will comment on in a minute, offset by strong results in BSG and our international results were possibly impacted by favorable currency rates and the addition of Guilbert operations for one month of June. On a diluted EPS basis as I said we made 19 cents a share versus 18 cents a year earlier. We had no impact -- EPS impact in the second quarter for the adoption of EITF 02-16. Originally, we anticipated that we could have as much as a 2 cent negative impact this quarter, but we managed our inventories better than we thought, inventory actually only increased slightly and therefore no EITF in this quarter's results. On a North American retail standpoint, as I said, sales were down 1% to 1.3b, comps were down 2.9%, compared that of 400 basis improvement over the first quarter of last year. Each month during the quarter got better and June as I said ended up with slightly positive comps. Our core office supply categories including ink and toner and the impact we've had from our merchandise changes in ink, toner, writing instruments, binders, and some early results from furniture, were positive for the quarter. Furniture by itself was down 5% for the quarter, that's a less of the decline in the first quarter of this year. Technology was down 7% that too is less negative as been in the past. In the technology area desktops and laptops were down 12%. [CTL], the configured order computer systems were up for the first time in several quarters as we implemented new technology in our retail stores nationwide, making it easier for customers to configure PC's, desktops to their configuration and we're seeing some nice increases in [CTLs] from that initiative. Comp transactions were up for the quarter in spite of being negative in April, and again throughout the quarter we saw improving trends in traffic and in transactions. Average ticket size declined about 2%, and that's predominantly because computers, monitors, and all-in-one machines where unit growth was up significantly in units, above 20% in both categories. Actual dollars were less than that and so that's the deflation going on in computers, monitors, and all-in-one machine. So, our unit activity is very encouraging but it's somewhat mitigated by average lower selling prices of these three categories. Our customer service indexes as you measure customer service in our stores as we started to focus on that now three years ago, increased again to its highest levels. We open seven stores, closed one, and relocated two, and we are on track to open 35-40 stores this year. The variability will occur in the fourth quarter when we make some decisions on whether to open them late in the quarter or carry them into 2004. Our comps and our retail were impacted significantly by merchandising issues. In Depot, we have a significant increase in units. Our binders rollout is complete. 3 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Our writing instrument rollouts were complete. Our furniture tests -- we began to test in the second quarter. We will now roll furniture initiatives to more than a third of the chain in the second half of the year. We are encouraged by the results we are seeing in our new furniture [pads], our new assortments, and what they are doing to drive furniture sales, and we are confident that we can roll back to a [third] of the store, third of the store by the end of the year. Technology, we are seeing some positive [web connect] in technology and in some cases we will make some significant technology changes in assortment and in layout and design that we think will improve technology during the fourth quarter. As I said earlier, Millennium was opened; the early results are quite encouraging. The results I am speaking to are really customer feedback. We are doing extensive customer research in this Millennium store. Our customers like this store a lot. They call it [inaudible]; easy to navigate, they shop longer in it. The average ticketing is slightly better than the chain. The approximate rates of merchandise are better than chain averages and while the store is only been opened for four weeks, we are encouraged by its results and are now foreseeing with remodeling 22-28 of those stores in the chain by the end of this year. Our Stop & Shop is now in all the 15 stores. We are encouraged by the results of Stop & Shop business well and this may result in future roll outs when discussions are now with Stop & Shop about that possibility. Retail excluding the impact of the EITF gross operating profit declined 345 basis points year-over-year, that's a 51% decline. I know for some of you now that are seeing in the details, you'll see gross margins that are declined in the quarter 305 basis points. Let me give you some insights of that. I know there's a great deal of concern that the promotional activity is driving these lower margins and that's simply not the case, let me give you some insight. Normally, we do not break out the component of occupancy expense, which we include in reported gross margins. But occupancy expense in this quarter was actually up quarter-over-quarter 100 basis points. Basically, half of that was the cost we absorbed to rule out [inaudible]. [Appreciate], we put in each shop in almost 850 stores. In additional to [electrical] moving fixtures, work, and labor, we absorbed cost in [inaudible] this quarter that we won't have on an ongoing basis. The other half of that 100 basis points is a result of the de-leveraging retail. Retail sales actually declined second quarter of this year versus second quarter of last year and the growing impact of new stores coming to our base as we now are accelerating somewhat store openings. The other basis point increase was predominantly associated with our decision late in the quarter to increase clearance activity to make our stores better and easier to implement the furniture, the binders, the right instruments [inaudible] layout. We made the decision late in the quarter to accelerate [clearance for] markdowns and this is over two-thirds of the difference in gross margins that we talked about the 200 basis points. Shrink did increase in the quarter pretty much on plan. We knew all along when we put ink and toner more accessible to our customers. We anticipated a higher level of shrink. Actually, shrink is actually below our anticipated rate, but higher year-over-year. I might add in the second quarter of last year, we had one of the best or the lowest shrink in the history of Office Depot and we are against that comparison. We now plan on implementing electronic tag systems in our retail stores prior to yearend, which we think will reduce even further what we believe to be industry leading shrink members. While our shrink went up, we are convinced as retailer were world class in this category, but we think the EAS system is where you are going to pull it more. We did have some margins impact as a result of the promotional activity. This promotional activity is predominantly focused on direct mail and [coupons] versus insert advertising. We plan to continue that. With dry store traffic, it does have an impact on margins but it doesn't generally cause wide spread comparative responses because these are highly targeted focused promotions, which have significantly high response rate from the customers that we sent the [coupons] promotional activities to.. Our retail expenses rose virtually all associated with the [inaudible] roll out and as I said earlier, we've sold about $10m as one-time cost in our retail operations this quarter. That we are -- the labor associated with [ink and toner roll out as well as the expenses we absorbed to implement that chain wide significant event during the quarter. As I said, as result, operating income in North American Retail declined 51% quarter-over-quarter. Turning to our North American business, Services Group, sales increased 1% for the second quarter and 2% for the first 6 months. Our contract division grew 5% reflecting continued gain in large national accounts. Sales in the east and the central region increased in the quarter -- in the first half, while sales in the west were lower compared to the same time last year due impart to the issues in the State of California with their budgetary issues. As most of you might know, we have a significant presence in California, historically we've had one and the budget issues in California are effecting our business and until California resolve those, it could cause some pressure on our growth rates in that important state. We added more than 18,000 new accounts to this business in the second quarter of this year. That's up from 17,000 new accounts in the first quarter. This business does have growth characteristics, particularly the large customer segment. In fact, in the last two days, we have been notified that we have received -- we have been awarded two significant contract accounts -- Philadelphia area college -- the Philadelphia area college coalition, which was formally a Staples account, and the State of Virginia, which was formally a Bosie State accounts, we think those will be at run rates north of $25m and really just evidence of our increased penetration into this large account segment. This business segment was negatively impacted softness in our Office Depot catalog sales. That continued in the second quarter, we believe we've taken actions including the consolidations of activities between Office 4 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Depot catalog and Viking that will lead to better results in the future, but the decline in that business, more than -- almost more than offset the gain in the contract business. Our domestic e-commerce sales in this category, as I said earlier, was 16%. On the operating profit side, this is really a great story. Given the fact that sales in this segment on a consolidated basis here in North America only grew 1%, we had an operating profit improvement of a 133 basis point and achieved a 9.5% operating margin. This has been one of the best stories of Office Depot in the last three years. In the last three years since June of 2000, we've taken out more than a $100m of costs out of our North American warehouses, we've done it without massive layoffs and we still have more opportunities to take further cost out of this business. So, this is the story in which we've done extremely well. We use technology to drive improvement, we've invested to drive returns, our quality measurements remain virtually at all-time highs, our gross margins were actually up in this segment over year-over-year as we focused on this healthy part of our business, and gives us a more balanced portfolio of businesses, which I will talk even more about including Guilbert. On the international side, sales in local currencies grew 28% and 52% in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency translation benefited sales in this segment by $91m. Now remember as well that we have included one month of Guilbert in these numbers and that was about $121m of revenue. From an EPS prospective, Guilbert after some early integration costs, added less than a penny to consolidated GAAP EPS. We continued to have our contract business, the Office Depot contract business that we have started up, grew nicely to over 97% in the quarter. Our e-commerce sales grew. We saw improvement in retail comps in France. Our results in Europe were offset by softness in Germany and some continued softness in France overall. But on an overall basis, at the international again, turned in a [stellar] performance. Gross profit in this segment was down 50 basis point, that's primarily a mix issue as we gain more our business in contract, it tends to mix down our margins. Operating and selling expenses actually were down 22 basis points despite our continued investments in new countries and new channels, which we had invested prior to the Guilbert acquisition. Operating income was down 28 basis point, again reflecting the contribution of our contract businesses. Operating income actually grew 48% in U.S. dollar in the second quarter. So when currency translation benefited operating profits by 10m that on a consolidated EPS basis less than a penny a share, we grew a 27% in local currencies and we continue to make progress in Japan, while we are still losing money in Japan, it's well on its way to reducing its losses again this year by 50%. We are seeing some light in Japan. We intend to add 6 stores in the second half of the year. We are seeing some historic performance in Japan that is encouraging in spite of the fact that the business is still losing money. Our contract business in Japan is also growing nicely and this is in spite of a very difficult economic environment in Japan. What I would like to do now is to turn the call over to Charles Brown, EVP and CFO who will give you some insight into Guilbert, insights into the rest of this year and going into the 2004, a little bit about our balance sheet some numbers, then I will finish up and we will turn the call over to questions. Just from a highlight perspective though, I would say that early on this has all of the appearance of being a great company and a great acquisition. Our surprises have been the depth and strength of their management team and as the more we visit, the more we are encouraged by what we see. We are encouraged by the morale of the Guilbert organization that likes being a part of a global company, whose focus is growing office products and related products. These are good businesses. It's early in the integration. Clearly, we got some challenges. We believe that we've got a management team both in place in Europe prior to the acquisition as well as a significant amount of talents from Guilbert. And on that regard, we just got through announcing internally our country management organization and over -- in 3 of our top 6 country managers are former Guilbert executives. So, with that I'm going to turn this over to Charlie, who will give you some insight into the numbers of Guilbert, a little bit about the transaction itself, some view looking forward, and then I'll close the call and listen to questions. Thanks for taking the time to be with us, Charlie. Charles Brown - Office Depot - EVP and CFO Thanks Bruce. Well I think the -- one of the key points in this transaction is that there have been no surprises. It has really unfolded pretty much as we had communicated back in April. In terms of financially, we've made the last payment which was 265m Euros in the third quarter on June 30th. I would point out that the purchase price ultimately is going to be around 780m Euros that contrast to the 815m Euros that we had announced at the signing of the transaction, a lot of that is just settling out through the sale and purchase agreement. In the quarter, as Bruce mentioned, we added $121m to our revenue, but the EPS impact was less than a penny. Early earning accretion was really reduced by merger costs and intangible amortization. I would also point out in our P&L that miscellaneous income, we have about $11m in our foreign currency gain as a resulted the cash and pooling arrangements that we executed leading up to Guilbert. So, there's 2 cents in miscellaneous income. Operating profit is in line with our expectations, so while sales were down, the business continues to pool in very well. First half revenues are down largely because of soft European economies and a stronger focus on account profitability. So, far what we've seen is our synergies have been confirmed. We were pretty much right 5 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call on with our modeling. Our costs are actually coming in lower than we model, so that's where the accretion comes from and we think the accretion to this acquisition is going to be 2-3 cents this year. That's up from basically flat and next year we expect 12-15 cents of accretion versus our previous guidance of 5-10 cents. Returning to the [cut] news financial highlights, our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $460m. Again, we had to complete the payment of Guilbert of $265m Euros, which actually come out and responded through that cash and a little bit of use of our revolver. Inventories in the quarter were a [1.257b] versus [1.001b] last year. I would point out that those inventories include about a $100m of Guilbert inventories. If you take out Guilbert, we were up slightly in retail that's the result of actually launching back-to-school earlier this year than last year. Our contract DSO was 42 days at the end of June that contrast to 47 days last year. We seem to book to log on that number. Our overall DSO is actually 24 days if you blend in the other portions on our receivables. Our CAPEX in the quarter was $53m; depreciation and amortization was a $111m. Our free cash flow was -- for the quarter was $25m, $82m for year-to-date. That excludes the impact of course of the Guilbert transaction. Now, turning to guidance for '03, North American retail; we expect our retail comps to be slightly positive in the third quarter and positive in the fourth quarter. This is continuing the trend that we saw second quarter and our sales both to positive retail comps; slight positive in June. Gross margin should decline about a 100 basis points versus last year in the third quarter and be somewhat flattish in the fourth quarter. Our costs were inline with -- our other costs are going to be inline with the same procedures as last year. In North American BSG, we expect our sales to take up in the third quarter followed by mid to high-single-digit growth in Q4. As we see the benefit in some of our improving trends in North American commercial catalog business. Gross margins will be down in the third quarter and the fourth quarter and BSG. This is the result of the increased mix of our large account customers. We expect our continued cost management in terms of our sales force and our North American warehouses and call centers to continue their performance, which has been absolutely outstanding over the last three years. Internationally, we'll now be almost $3b by the end of the year in terms of we rolled in our Guilbert acquisition. However, when we mix Guilbert's gross margins, we expect our overall international gross margins will mix down by about 250 basis points; again, the contract business being a lower margin business than the banking business. Operating margins, [this will] show some improvement; however, we will continue to manage those very aggressively across all our businesses. In the quarter -- in the second quarter our tax rate actually declined and we expect tax rate to be at 32.5% for the balance of the year. This is largely a reflection in mixing in our acquisition of Guilbert, our international operations, which we enjoy some very, very favorable tax rates as result of some of the structural things that we have done. Our capital expenditures are on track at [$253m]. We have pulled back a little bit as result of the Guilbert acquisition. We now anticipate the full year EPS will be in the $1.5-1.7 range that excludes the cumulative effect; we are adopting EITF 02-16, which we did at the beginning of the year. And, it seems there are no further impacts as a result of the inventories on the balance of the year. And with that we'll now do turn it back to Bruce. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman and CEO Thanks Charlie just a couple of more comments on Guilbert just from the sales trend perspective, Guilbert being it's -- in 2002 actually had a down year in sales those trends continue in to 2003. For Guilbert June was actually down year-over-year; we anticipated that that's the reflection of their focusing on profitability, their margins were up. So, we anticipate year-over-year with Guilbert, if we were standalone, we would actually have less revenue in 2003 than it did it 2002. I also point out that in our EPS results for the quarter, yeah, I gave some additional other income that was in a way directly related to Guilbert. When we knew we would be paying for Guilbert in euros, we moved US dollars to our Irish financing subsidiary and got a larger currency gain on that transaction than we originally anticipated, and so when you go into the details of our P&L, you shall see other income up slightly, about 2 cents. Predominantly result of that one-time movement of currency in preparation for the purchase of Guilbert, and as Charlie said, this is a great company, and we settled along that at least in this half of the year, we didn't anticipate a lot of growth in the Guilbert business year after year, we don't anticipate that, but we do look forward to growth in 2004. The quarter in just summary before we turn over to questions. The quarter was a good quarter, I don't think it's a great quarter, but it was a good quarter. I think I would ask you to focus on what this Executive team said it would do. This is now being three years we've been together most of us and we said that we would focus on delivering results and we have. We changed our business portfolio. With the acquisition of Guilbert we now have almost a third of our business outside the United States. With our growing delivery business in North America and our contract business, we 6 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call have a much more balanced business portfolio and that means we believe -- we think we can deliver overtime consistent results. This makes us somewhat less dependent on North American Retail as retail in North America is now less than 50% of our sales. But we also promise we would not lose focus and sight on driving North American Retail sales, we haven't and we won't. I know there is concern about margins. I can tell you -- I can only say to you that on a go forward basis, we do not see structural, pricing, marketing or competitive factors today that would cause us to believe that margins are a problem in retail on a go forward basis. We have always had mix issues in margins and for example, in the third quarter, we are optimistic about back-to-school. Back-to-school trends at lower margins, we comp negative last year in back-to-school it's our belief we will comp positive back-to-school this year. So, on that basis, I think, we have a good quarter. I think the take away is the momentum Office Depot is gaining, [momentum] in retail, we have initiated a lot of initiatives, we have had an awful lot of people work hard to get these done including our people in our retail stores. Our contract business [inaudible] accelerating. We've got better merchandizing today than we've had in our long time of Office Depot or may be ever. Our margin advertising programs are more effective, our ads are better, they are more focused. And so, we build momentum one step at a time and we will now take that forward. So with that, we will now turn the call over to your questions. Thanks again for taking the time to listen to us this morning. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Operator At this time, if you do have a question, please press "*" "1" on your touch-tone phone. Again, that is "*" "1" to ask a question. If you wish to withdraw your question, you may press "*" "2". Today, our first question from Matthew Fassler, sir your line is open. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs - Analyst Thank you very much and good morning. A couple of questions to ask today; first of all Bruce, can you give us a little more insight on why you see -- why you anticipate some turnaround in the catalog business? And just a little more detail on some of the steps that you are taking to drive the business forward? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman and CEO Yeah, first of all, it is -- frankly it has been soft for sometime and so you have started to, in some respects, anniversary [of] a little better numbers. Two is, we really believe by combing the marketing, merchandizing organizations of Viking domestic, and Office Depot catalog and putting those in a new business unit with a new leader called Business Direct. We believe we need to focus on better prospecting and advertising and customer contact and combine that with some things we're doing ion our call centers, we think we can earn this business from the great extent in terms of negative growth to neutral to slightly positive. It's not all going to happen in the third quarter, but directionally we're starting to see some signs that encourage us. So, as good prospecting has to do with the combination of synergy you get when you combine marketing and advertising organizing together, we're optimistic with some things we've done in catalogs. We just launched our best new big book ever to our custom base; we believe this business will somewhat accelerate. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs - Analyst Got you. And just a couple of quick questions on some of the numbers, looking at the cash flow statement, operating cash flow, as it is disclosed here, is down a bit. The biggest delta seems to be changes in working capital and other. And Charlie, if you could just give up a little bit of the detail whether some of the working capital increases related to the acquisition show up as cash increases in working capital or whether they are line items, receivables or inventory what not, that would show a significant increase even ex the acquisition. 7 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Charles Brown - Office Depot - EVP and CFO Well, with the Guilbert acquisition, we did increase our investment in working capital. Guilbert brought over with it about 300m in receivable, that's now -- that's why we had a very large jump in our receivable portfolio to over $1b. And as I mentioned earlier in the call, it's a $100m in inventory. All other of that is connected to the Guilbert acquisition. Unidentified Corporate Participant I think, Mat, there is another piece on retail. We did make a decision also in the quarter to field a little earlier for back-to--school and that has got some increased inventory in our second quarter results. Had we built on a same basis as last year, our inventory in the second quarter would actually would have declined, but we think there is an opportunity in back to school and we will be a couple of -- it's interesting we are back to school since July, but some schools will start in a couple of weeks. And so, we got some early encouraging signs as a result of the inventory built there. Our DSO in North America is trying find out actually better. Yeah -- and one thing we are [anniversaring] is significant improvement in our supply chain a year ago. Yes. We still have the industry's highest inventory return. We know that's true in retail, we think it's true in our BSG business. So, it does get a little more difficult to keep improving that -- although we think we will.. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs - Analyst Correct, great. And finally what does cash and debt look like, I guess after you have the final payment on the Guilbert transaction? Unidentified Corporate Participant After the transaction we are into our revolver about $60m. As you know, there is a certain amount of cash when you compare the balance sheet, it's trapped in the system, so you'll see that there, but we are into our revolver about 60m. Our current cash flow projections have this actually working out with that by the end of the year. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs - Analyst Great thank you very much. Unidentified Corporate Participant On that subject as well, we said along, we financed this Guilbert merger with all cash and we said that once we completed that transaction, we would look at alternatives and we are so there could be some options we look at in the second half of the year. Because at the moment that's all been financed by internal cash, but the good news is we had the cash to do it with. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs - Analyst Thank you so much. Operator Thank you our next question comes from Aram Rubinson. Your line is open. 8 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Aram Rubinson - Banc of America Securities - Analyst Hey good morning guys. Unidentified Corporate Participant Good morning Aram. Aram Rubinson - Banc of America Securities - Analyst One question about the U.S. catalog business it seems as if not you just you, but your competitors are like or kind of struggling a little bit in a U.S. catalog space and I am curious as to what you are going to do with mailings if you think that space is kind of go out of capacity. I do, but just kind of curious what your thoughts are on that business? Unidentified Corporate Participant Aram, if you think it has got a lot, then it must. You are a smart guy. I mean that, but I don't -- I think this is more indicative of the impact this economy has had on small- or medium-size businesses. I think the untold story about this economic environment is that how hard small- and medium-size business have been hit. I think that's reflective in our retail comps I have said all along. I know you all like to compare that with our two major competitors, but the reality is -- we've got -- we've always had and continue to have more of our business focusing small or medium-size business, so that's one. Two is, I think that the independent dealers that have survived onslaught of super stores are better competitors today then they were in past. Three is, I just -- there is a still a large segment of customers who prefer to buy catalogue, and I think that the way that you get at this is we have this challenge in a multi-channel environment at where we generate or where we put the sale, and my only point is we look at it in a multi-functional basis, and I won't comment specifically on what we do intent to may [inaudible] got some appropriate. It's just -- I am just saying I think this business is going to continue to comp negative as it has. I don't think that -- I think I am optimistic about our ability to do that without going into the specificity of some plans we are doing as we speak and some we have [more of]. And again, I am not trying to be evasive, I just don't' think it's wise to talk about those from a competitive basis and again, I think we are going to get synergies in this segment by the combination of [inaudible] and Office Depot marketing, merchandizing, advertising organizations. So that's my optimism that business starts to pick up slightly. We haven't put in our forecast for this year robust business yet, it just picks up. Aram Rubinson - Banc of America Securities - Analyst Just one quick follow-up, when you talk about the accretion from Guilbert, does that incorporate the lower tax rate that you're seeing on consolidated basis or is that from an operating line? Unidentified Corporate Participant Well, the synergies, as we have talked about back in April, did have a fair amount of tax synergies in it, so that -- it is in that number. Aram Rubinson - Banc of America Securities - Analyst Okay and so then that tax is what like a penny or quarter or something? Unidentified Corporate Participant The rates dropping from 34-32.5 so -- 9 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Aram Rubinson - Banc of America Securities - Analyst Okay, just wanted to double check. Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Binder. Sir, your line is open. Daniel Binder - Buckingham Research Associates - Analyst Yes hi, few questions, first on your ongoing investment in Europe, now that you've made the acquisition of Guilbert, will that back off at all? I know it's pretty significant last year. Secondly, can you give us the idea what impact markdowns -- the higher than expected markdowns hit EPS? And then lastly, given the good results from Stop and Shop, and I guess it sounds like you might have the potential rollout there at some point. Is there an opportunity to do that with other grocery chains? Unidentified Corporate Participant Okay, with the three questions, first on the internationals investment side, we are still early into acquiring Guilbert and certainly have to understand from the capital prospective the conditions of their facilities, the condition of their systems, if you will, and what all that means on CAPEX. And I don't have a lot more insight on that yet because that's work is being done as we speak In terms of the investment in startup cost, I think we have begun to slow and we did that in the last couple of months to hiring plans we had for new sales reps in the countries in which we competed against Guilbert and so, once we were certain that we could close the Guilbert transaction, we basically started to back off plans to hire our own reps because we said there is some synergy there. So, on the CAPEX I think, Dan, I got to answer that later. I think it's fair to say that if you look to the CAPEX spending, we would not anticipate that it would dramatically increase or decrease, it just might be done in different places. The other thing I add on CAPEX again as the business grows and your grow activity, certainly you put pressure on warehouses and we've got a couple of major new facilities either underway in Europe or we've approved in Europe, either way they are going to add to CAPEX and those predominantly are in U.K. and France. On the second question on markdowns, if you go back again and say that our retail on a reported basis is down 305 basis points. I said a 100 of that was gross -- was occupancy related. So we are looking at 200 basis points. I think it is fair to say that almost two-thirds of that was focused on the acceleration of clearance and markdown, so, a substantial portion of it. And again, that's the decision we made to move it out, have the effect of reducing this in-store inventories, have the effect of giving us more space in stores, have the effect of getting merchandize out quickly, so we take less of a hit on it if it didn't sell. It made easier to re-plan-o-gram merchandizing that we did in ink and toner and right -- and furniture, we all have one plan to do. We just accelerated. It just appeared to us as we started to roll this out, we needed to do that. So, I think, you know, directionally two-thirds of the 200 basis point decline in the second quarter of real margin is in retail. Daniel Binder - Buckingham Research Associates - Analyst Okay, and then lastly on the Stop and Shop? Unidentified Corporate Participant Stop and Shop, yes, that is, you know, I don't -- that's [where I have] no comment. I think we are happy with our results to-date on Stop and Shop. They seem to be happy as well. I have said all along that this leadership team will focus on ways to grow our North American business. I know all of you would like me to tell in advance what those ways are. I told you we grow in the first half -- first quarter of last year and the base that we took into over the second quarter to you believe this in total. So we wouldn't articulate and that's kind of where we are and specially our new formats, I think that we continue to try to drive revenue. And certainly there are lots of other supermarket chains and all other kinds of chains that use you imagination. I don't know and it's not appropriate time to comment anyway even if I were more certain. So, I appreciate the question, Dan, just 10 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call competitively I think we like the Stop and Shop, it's done okay. We have got 15 stores. They are happy, we are happy. We'll refine it and make even better. We will see where it goes from there. Daniel Binder - Buckingham Research Associates - Analyst Just as a point of clarification, are you starting to see a pickup in catalog yet or you are just doing things are we should believe it could pickup next quarter? Unidentified Unidentified Corporate Participant There has been some pickup in Viking's domestic result and we starting to see a slight pickup Office Depot catalog. So, yeah, it's slight -- yes, a little bit. Daniel Binder - Buckingham Research Associates - Analyst Thanks. Operator your next question comes from Gary Balter. Sir, your line is open. Gary Balter - UBS - Analyst Thank you. Three questions, Bruce if you can. One is a longer one, but your thoughts on the competitive scenario changing once Office Max gets incorporated within [Boise] conceiving the most direct overlap with their businesses. Second is your talked about Business Services Group getting stronger and then when Charlie was talking -- you mentioned the contracts that you are able to get, and when Charlie was talking he mentioned gross margin going down in that business. How do we on that side where but we don't get to see the specifics on numbers feel comfortable that we are not just trading margin for sales and the bottomline isn't really going to be any stronger? In other words, you're just essentially buying business right now. And then the third, could you tell us how much the clearance help the comps in the quarter and what the inventory looks like right now?And are you clean] as we go into the third quarter? Thank you. Unidentified Corporate Participant Geese], those are long questions. I am going to take the BSG first and talk about because you can't see the numbers. First of all, large accounts historically have lower gross margins than small medium-sized accounts? Gary Balter - UBS - Analyst Right, we know that. Unidentified Corporate Participant That's the way it is. The question is are those accounts profitable on a fully allocated basis and yes, they are. Second of all, do they drive [inaudible], the answer is yes, they do. Third of all, those up scales, it helps you buy better and reach programs that you otherwise wouldn't reach without them. Fourth of all, even though the percentage may be less, they add absolute dollars of income and that's it. And so I can only tell you that this 11 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call organization is focused on account profitability. I came into the business three years ago and so we were focused on that basis. I think that is part and partial part of why we've taken out -- how we've taken out $100m of [Warehouse cost. We focus on account profitability and there are some large accounts we continue to walk away from and which we don't think we can deliver value to our shareholders and we are not trying trade dollars for dollars. So, that -- as this segment gets bigger, we will average down our gross margins. We may average down our operating profit contribution, we will not average down total profit contribution. And on a total return basis, account profitable basis, I can just assure you that this management team has not lost its focus. As the matter of fact frankly, I think we could accelerate our sales growth in this segment if we wanted to take some marginal accounts, which at times we think some of our competitors do. Gary Balter - UBS - Analyst Okay. Unidentified Corporate Participant The third question is what the impact of this shrink did on comps, I don't know that -- Gary Balter - UBS - Analyst The shrink and the clearance? Unidentified Corporate Participant And that clearance. Yes, I mean, clearance. Excuse me, I made a mistake. So, the clearance did on comps, I don't know I don't think it's material. I don't think you ought to be concerned that the large amount of clearance drove unusually positive comps and therefore we don't have them here and [possibly] trends. Gary Balter - UBS - Analyst Okay. Unidentified Corporate Participant Basically comps in all categories that are important to us, certainly had some impact, but frankly I don't think it's material or if it were I think we'd call it out. Gary Balter - UBS - Analyst And the inventory is clean going in? Unidentified Corporate Participant Pardon. 12 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Gary Balter - UBS - Analyst The inventory is clean going in --? Unidentified Corporate Participant Yeah, I think --- clean because -- Gary Balter - UBS - Analyst Cleaner? Unidentified Corporate Participant Cleaner. I mean we got $1b of inventory. I mean, it's never fully clean. I mean, this is the nature of retail. But yeah, I think our inventory is pretty clean, I do -- I am pretty confident about our merchandising initiatives. We could have some -- we are going to rollout furniture to another third of the chain and certainly I think we could have some clearance in that category as we roll that out. But I -- but that's again accelerating what we think the benefit is. So there could be some clearance activity in furniture in the quarter, but I mean looking forward we think retail gross margins will be in the neighbor of a 100 basis points less in the third quarter than it were last year. And we try to roll that in. Back to the merger; yes, true that we, Office Depot, more overlap max on a retail basis than does our competitor Staples. I don't think in the short-term the merger adds retail expertise and strength to Office Max, I don't. I mean I think [Boise] has got a lot of smart people there, I used to work there and I have respect for how they run a business, but they don't think off the first [T] if I could borrow their expression, they get -- they are stronger in retail because of the merger. I think they are a stronger player as it relates to buying and I think the short-term impact is all about manufactures, and I think that's -- if I were a manufacturer, I might be somewhat worried today because if you look at the early aspects of that merger, at least the justification they did publicly, it's a lot based on purchasing synergy. There is an aspect of our business that it is important too, is [cut-size] paper, certainly Boise has got an expertise in that. It went from the fourth largest in that category and they talk about a [mill direct model] and I suppose that could give them some world class cost to get paper from the paper mill to the desktop. I think we live in a competitive world and I would guess that our paper suppliers would step up to the plate and say share to them is important, so I don't anticipate that going to lower margins at least from our perspective. I don't know about the paper manufacturers. From a balance sheet standpoint, you're a better expert at this than I am, I mean this is a combined company that certainly has got to find some ways to raise cash and to a long-term reduce debt and I don't know how they intend to do that and I suppose you could argue that the combined company kind of finalizes the fact that there will be three players in the super stores segment for some time. I know there's always been some speculation whether Max would make it or not, and as you probably know Gary, I've never been on the side that said they will go out of business. Gary Balter - UBS - Analyst Yes. Unidentified Corporate Participant They are a competitor, well they are-- well they have got the great retail price, they are a very good competitor. I'd expect them to remain one. I don't think [inaudible] necessarily makes them a better competitor, that's my view. Gary Balter - UBS - Analyst Okay, thank you very much. 13 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Operator Our next question comes from Colin McGranahan, sir your line is open. Colin McGranahan - Sanford Bernstein - Analyst Thank you, a couple of easy ones. First, the tax rate, should we assume 32.5 for next year as well? Unidentified Corporate Participant Yes. Colin McGranahan - Sanford Bernstein - Analyst And then you said EITF, they were impacted in the second half as in your assumption, care to comment at this point with what -- how it might look third and fourth quarter? Unidentified Corporate Participant No, I think we'll not comment now. As you know what happens is -- as we build our inventories and then part of what we are doing now as we try to grab our comps and retail will be a lot of [tweaks] inventory in it. We would rather just not confuse the situation by adding it in. Colin McGranahan - Sanford Bernstein - Analyst Okay. Unidentified Corporate Participant We just don't think, I mean as we look at it now Colin, our plan is that we will not have any EITF impact in the second half, but again as you know that's all that function what happens to your inventory. Colin McGranahan - Sanford Bernstein - Analyst And how much we've to differ? Unidentified Corporate Participant And how much we have to defer a vendor program and even that's not a science. Unidentified Corporate Participant I might add too that one of our many challenges is that the specificity all of you would like us to get the EPS. I would point out to you that a penny EPS at Office Depot is about $4m -- $4-5m and you are - - their expectation is we can get our earnings within a penny or two for the year that's pretty finite. So that's one of our many challenges and we try to give, you know some insight to our business to get it down to that degree of specificity and a pretty complex business model that's got a lots of moving parts to it. So, -- 14 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Unidentified Corporate Participant And we understand that the EITF is fairly confusing. Okay it's confusing to you, it's sometimes even confusing to us and what we are trying to do is be absolutely clear about what's in the number and not in the number, and so it's not in our second half, but when we issue our big quarter update -- you are really in a position and to comment on it. Colin McGranahan - Sanford Bernstein - Analyst Got you. Finally Bruce for, you know, you had a Guilbert under the belt for about the month here and have you learned anything about their ideas for growing the business and what do you think the top line growth of that business can be going forward? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman and CEO Well, I think first of all this is an organization from the top level of it that has focused on not going at the top line for the last year and half. This is the focus this organization has had throughout Guilbert, this is general statement about improving the profitability of the business and focusing on getting profitability. So that's the first thing. So, two is I think we are liable to get as we did to sales forces integrated and we get a mind set into Guilbert that we're eager to grow. We got the capacity and capability to grow, but I think we'll [inaudible]. I think if you look to the Guilbert model in to '04, and by the way we will not in the future continue to break out Guilbert. I mean, just so you understand, we're going to park it into our international segment. It will be harder to un-mingle it of you will, we broke out in June so you know the impact will give you some insight to what the -- certainly going forward to next year, we're not going to comment about Guilbert separately. But I would say that the Guilbert, we wouldn't anticipate that Guilbert would grow next year to '04 in the low- to mid-single digit, and then accelerate in the out years as we get rationalization to our sales force, as we build in a culture of growing, I mean our Office Depot contract sales force has been obsessed and focused on growing. We think there's some [up turn] in Guilbert. It does double our size so you would expect that our growth rates overall in Europe will flow because Guilbert basically doubles our size, but again we are not anticipating and didn't anticipate in our model that it would grow this year on the top line. We see growth starting to occur in 2004 and beyond, and I think can accelerate beyond 2004. We are seeing some nice growth in one or two countries in Guilbert. So, it's not a country by country thing. And, again I am not going to comment on which are those countries, but I can tell you a month into this thing, I am delighted this is a part of our company and delighted with the leadership we have seen at Guilbert. Delighted with the merger progress to-date, although it's five weeks in. This is going to be a great company and this is going to be a great acquisition. So, rigorous risk to integrate goals. It always is, and therepeople are dedicated to making this work. So long answer for your question [Collin], but give you some insights that will be additive as we see it six weeks after we acquired it. Colin McGranahan - Sanford Bernstein - Analyst I appreciate it. Thanks. Operator Our next question comes from Michael Baker. Sir your line is open. Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank - Analyst Hi, thank you. I just wanted to ask a quick question on the retail gross margin, the numbers you gave up, total declines of 300 basis points, a 100 from the occupancy costs, 200 from the clearance activity and then there is also some decline from the ink and toner shrink, I guess, would that imply that there was some positive offsets? 15 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Unidentified Corporate Participant Yeah -- what I said was that go back again -- the 200 basis point decline in -- if I call it real margins for minute excluding the impact of occupancy. I said about two-thirds of that was clearance related. The other third of that was a combination of promotional activity and higher shrink. Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank - Analyst All right, I got you. Okay, thanks. [inaudible]. Unidentified Corporate Participant Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Sims. Sir, your line is open. Bill Sims - Salomon Smith Barney - Analyst Good morning two question, if I may. First, can you comment on how your strategies that was in Japan over the past year and given estimate yet and when you might see profitability there and second question is have you seen any noticeable increase in employee turnover at Guilbert relative to initial expectations? Unidentified Corporate Participant Yeah, good questions. First, on Japan, I would expect that looking at the business that is today, I think that we would look at 2004 as trying to breakeven. We haven't done our 2004 detailed plans yet, but directionally, I would hope we could come close to an operating profit breakeven position in Japan. The way our strategies change, we went to a single brand; we had an Office Depot and Viking brand. We went to a single brand and that's proven to be a right decision. We've substantially changed our store portfolio in Japan; we originally had three or four pretty large stores, typically, US sized stores. We opened stores today at 3,000 -- 3,500 square feet and they get an enormous amount of activity. We've got a contract business growing in Japan. We've hired a new person; we are really excited about; he is a great leader. So, far we think even helpful long term with having Japan led by a Japanese natural. We've got global sourcing, but we haven't talked off a lot about, but we think there is upside long term, the global sourcing including Japan. On the turnover side at Guilbert, we've not yet seen it, we do have a concern about it anytime you talk about mergers people get that the feeling that there is high amounts of redundancy. The reality is Guilbert is highly complimentary. Guilbert is predominantly focused in all countries expect one on large accounts segments. There is one country in which they were more balanced in their approach and as a result, we don't see a lot of redundancy in sales reps. There is certainly some redundancies in G&A. We're through a detailed process of interviewing and analysis, we will make our final organizational announcements at the end of August, and certainly there is some anxiety until that happens, but no, we've not seen a huge turnover, we lost a couple of people that we didn't want to lose out of the some 1,500 they had, absolutely did. What we're really excited about is their excitement to be part of us and that seems to hold true, country by country. We've been on a road show in those countries and we're getting a lot -- off a lot of good feedback about our organization, and as I said earlier half the leaders of our countries come from Guilbert, and I think that helps this turnover as you saw. This is in the case where Office Depot acquired Guilbert and everybody that ran Office Depot get the new jobs, like running the combined both. We are getting the best for the best. So, good questions Bill, but I don't -- I'm not concerned at this point about turnover of Guilbert. 16 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Bill Sims - Salomon Smith Barney - Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Corsal sir your line is open. Jim Corsal - - Analyst Yeah, sir I'm working for more granularity on the new furniture role out, are you going to have more SKUs or fewer SKUs? Are you changing vendors? Are you going direct to more foreign sourcing of product? Any sort of granularity there? Unidentified Corporate Participant Jim, you know, the granularity is a challenge for us, because part of its competitive, I think if I characterize it this way, we are changing our assortment to focus on different value propositions, giving customers better choices for where they use the furniture and making those choices more clear in the furniture pad, both with [size], information, content, and the use of intranet technology. Frankly, most of the furniture in this new initiative is not foreign sourced, it's domestically sourced. In terms of SKUs, there is not a really huge net change in SKUs one way or another. There are different SKUs and so we got to get out of some old ones and get into some new ones. We've got it tested today in 30 some stores. We'll grow to a third of the chain, hopefully by year-end. Some would just say, why just a third? Basically it's the stores in which furniture is more important. Some of our stores have a higher percentage of furniture than others. So, I, in fact, helped you with the granularity of it. The test stores are doing well. We are excided about the results and we think we can get this category positive again. We have always been the leader in the superstore segment with the percent of sales we have in furniture that [lead then] when furniture and the economy turns difficult, means we've been more impacted and we think now we can turn furniture, which is negative comp now I think for three to four quarters, to positive and so, let's hope that helped you Jim with the granularity. Jim Corsal - - Analyst The vendors, though, are they the same folks you are dealing with right now? Unidentified Corporate Participant [Predominantly] the same vendors, yes. [They are actually] most of the same, not all the same, but directionally they are actually most of the same. Jim Corsal - - Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you I will like to turn the call back over to Nelson. Thank you sir. 17 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman and CEO Well thanks. We kept you a little longer then the hour we planned. I hope we've given you some insight into our business that helps you understand a lot of parts of the second quarter. As I said earlier from our perspective, it was a good quarter. It's not a great quarter and that's kind of where we are as a company. We think we are a good company, we are on our way to great. Great means we sustain results over a long period of time. We remain focused on our key initiatives growing North American retail sales, growing our North American delivery business, successfully integrating Guilbert and continuing to use technology and investments in technology to drive efficiency and productivity in our business evidenced by those results in our North American warehouses. We are optimistic about our ability to turn retail comps from negative of 13 straight quarters, where we believe our first positive quarter in a long time at Office Depot and we think that's the third quarter. We have some optimism about back to school, because we've, we believe, the best fully integrated coordinated multi-channel program in our history. This management team is committed to driving growing. We've demonstrated that over three years. We will not lose our focus. We will not try to drive revenue to the top line for the sake of the top line. We will try and drive profitable revenue that adds value to our organization and our shareholders. Thanks for taking the time this morning to listen to the Office Depot story. Have a great day, thanks. Operator Thank you. That concludes today's call, you may disconnect at this time.

Kirk Hayes - VCP - Thomson Financial Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to VCP's conference call to discuss second quarter 2003 results. If you do not have a copy of the relevant press release, it is available at the company's website at www.vcp.com.br at the investor's link. Before proceeding let me mention that forward looking statements are being made under the Safe Harbor of the Security Litigation Reform Act of 1996.

With us today in Sao Paolo this morning is Mr. Raul Calfat, CEO, Mr. Valdir Roque, CFO and Investor Relations Director. First Mr. Calfat will comment in the company's second quarter results, and after that we will open for questions and answers. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to him. Mr. Calfat, you may now begin. Raul Calfat - VCP - CEO Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Thank you all for joining us on today's second quarter 2003 earnings. Before I reveal the company's performance for the quarter, I would like to begin with some commentary on the recent behavior of the pulp and paper markets. During the second quarter we have seen pulp prices rising in response to inventory reductions in the international markets that occurred in the first quarter. This happened as a result of an imbalance in supply that was atypical for the period. Towards the end of the second quarter, supply returned to normal levels allowing producers to build inventories once again, which began to place downward pressure on prices. So, in the third quarter, prices had begun to pull back from their recent peaks. [national] paper-Brazilian paper markets experienced significant contraction during the second quarter as a result of diminished purchasing power brought on by inflation. As well as an [inaudible] monetary policy characterized by high interest rates. The drop in demand in the domestic markets particularly for cut size and coated papers reflected an 8% average retraction in the overall Brazilian paper markets during the first half of this year. I would like to emphasize that despite the appreciation of the Real, domestic paper prices remain stable, especially printing papers. The only product group that suffered any price reduction was carbonless and thermal papers. High prices were adjusted downward by 5%. However, this affect was partially offset by lowest costs as a proportion of production input are imported. We expect that domestic demands 2 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call in the third quarter will continue to be soft as a result of current economic measures. However, in the fourth quarter, the impact of seasonality could drive demand higher, aided by a lower interest rate environment, according to signals given by the current administration. Moving back to VCP. During the second quarter our production continued to progress according to expectations, and we reached 80% of total production capacity. At the end of the second quarter, we initiated our 14-day maintenance shutdown. We expect that full production capacity will be reached within the next three months. I would like to also remind you that during the second quarter, the Real appreciated 14% which had a negative impact on our exports. However, our sales in the domestic markets, when translated into US [GAAP] were positively affected, offsetting the impact of the stronger Real on exports. This confirms the strategic importance of VCP's diversified market exposure. A combination of a focus on market pulp, which is a global product, directed to export markets, and printing papers, mostly directed to the domestic markets, allowed us to produce strong earnings despite the low exchange rate environment. Just a final note on our CAPEX budget for the year-we had originally planned for investment of approximately $220m in 2003. We have reduced this amount to $190m. Why? We will continue to proceed with our main project, the lower amount reflects an adjustment to certain investment schedules as well as lower expected overall costs [for] investments. At this time I would like to turn over the call to our CFO, Valdir Roque who will comment on financial items for the quarter. Valdir Roque - VCP - CFO Thank you Raul. Good morning everyone. And thank you for joining us today. I would like to point out just a few items on the income statement and balance sheet, before we open the call to answer the questions. On the income statement we'll see that there are [net] financial expense in US GAAP [remaining practically] and [changing] despite the appreciation of the Real during the period. This is an important point because it shows that VCP's positions are [inaudible], and even during periods of higher exchange rate volatility. The 14% appreciation of the Real during the period also had an impact on our income tax rate which you will notice was lower in the second quarter of this year. VCP is participating with [inaudible] the company has been taxed at 3% of sales revenues and 34% of financial revenue. Before the Real appreciation, the tax rate was lower. By year-end, we expect that our tax rate will be around 15-16% depending on the exchange rate level. On the balance sheet side I would like to point out that after the apparent increase in our main debt position, our US debt, was actually a function of the Real appreciation on Real denominated debt. In real terms we had a reduction, even considering the payment of the dividends of $40m. We also expect the continuation of this reduction by the year-end. That concludes our opening remarks, on the second quarter earning. And we will now be happy to take any questions you may have. Operator please continue. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Operator Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question and answer session. If you have a question please press the (*) followed by the (1) on your touchtone phone now. If at any time you would like to remove yourself from the question queue, press (#). Please restrict your questions to two at a time. Our first question comes from Mr. Marcel Kaya [ph] with CSSB [ph]. Marcelo Kaya - CCSB - Analyst Hello gentlemen, good morning, congratulations on the strong results. My question really is about the cycle, and how you see downtime versus accumulating inventories in the coming months. How this might be a bit unfair of a question, but as a major shareholder, in Attacruz [ph] when you go to the board meetings, how do you see this decision from Attacruz [ph] to accumulate inventories instead of taking down time? And then, how do you see VCP in the second half of the year? Do you see VCP taking more down time? Or if the cycle does not improve do you see VCP also going for a policy of accumulating some inventories? 3 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Earnings Conference Call Valdir Roque - VCP - CFO Thank you for the question, Marcelo. As we see, we should have some sliding pricing during the third quarter of the year on account of the summer vacations in the Northern Hemisphere. But we see some kind of rebound during the fourth quarter. Mostly on account of macroeconomic conditions in the US. That may be pushing other economies as well. Also, China. If you looked at Chinese statistics during the first 5 months of the year, they have been importing at a rate that is lower than expected. Last year they imported something about 5 million francs and during the first 5 months of the year they have imported approximately 40% of what they did in the same period of last year. So, as we see, stocks are not at the high level at the moment. Although [inaudible] are situated at something like 1.7 [million] tons. You can consider overall stocks, also taking into account consumer stocks, they are not high at the moment. And as demand recovers during the fourth quarter, we may see prices going back to the previous levels. So, answering your question about down time, or accumulating stocks-we think that the decision of accumulating stocks for this period, and a rebound is foreseen for the near future, is a proper decision. I would say the decision of downtime should be taken [inaudible]. So this accumulation will remain in stock for a long period, and maybe present prices [inaudible]. But this is not the case. So I think that accumulating stocks at this moment is the right decision. Marcelo Kaya - CCSB - Analyst How, if we don't see any improvement in the cycle, in the second half of the year. Let's suppose that things don't work out the way we would like. Do you see VCP also going for that policy? Valdir Roque - VCP - CFO If we don't have a rebound in the international economy, and the demand doesn't move up, and we continue to have an imbalance between supply and demand, I would say that our decision would be going for some kind of downtime. But of course [inaudible] just in case we don't see a rebound coming during the fourth quarter, which in our opinion is not the case. Marcelo Kaya - CCSB - Analyst Okay, the second question I had, very quickly, is about the trend in the paper market in Brazil given the state of the economy which continues to be weak. Do you see any pressure on prices, especially when you look towards the end of the year? Valdir Roque - VCP - CFO Well, domestic prices have been stable during the second quarter despite a drop in demand. You are quite right when you say that domestic markets for every good in Brazil is actually suffering at the moment from macroeconomic conditions. We expect that the market won't recover during the third quarter. And only during the fourth quarter, on account of seasonal reasons. And also because we believe that the government will start dropping interest rates from next week. So, we believe that the markets will move up. So, during this period, Marcelo, I don't see any movement in prices for the domestic market. My opinion is that they will remain stable, provided of course, domestic, or the exchange rate between the Real and the US Dollar remains at this level. I don't believe that the Real will further strengthen against the US Dollar, on the opposite, the Real should actually maybe weaken during the coming months, reinforcing domestic prices. But if they remain, the exchange rate remains as it is now, I believe prices are going to remain flat. Marcelo Kaya - CCSB - Analyst That is helpful. Thanks a lot. 4 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

How are you? And congratulations on a very strong result. Quick question on your pulp production ramp up. We noticed that production didn't increase much in the second quarter, versus the first quarter, and I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on the learning curve of the new fiber line. And your inventory, number of days of inventory in production, you have on hand. And also, if you could give us some sense regarding your pulp cash cost, it went up substantially year-on-year despite the higher production and therefore dilution of the cost that was [profitable] and the weaker Real. So, if you could maybe talk to us about what's going on with the new line. What are your expectations in terms of production for the second half of the year? If you continue [inaudible] 700,000 ton target for pulp sales and on your cost side what's going on? Raul Calfat - VCP - CEO Thank you for your question, Thomas. During the second quarter our production of market pulp was about 170,000 tons in comparison with 162,000 tons during the first quarter. But you have to take into account that during the second quarter we stopped our pulp line for a week on account of the yearly maintenance. So, this has actually affected production. But during the quarter, we operated with an average capacity of about 80%. We have had some profit adjustments, and during the maintenance which took 14 days, it was actually 7 days during the second quarter, 7 days will affect the third quarter. But after this maintenance, we have changed some equipment in our digester and we have done some fine tuning also in other areas of the pulp mill. So, our expectation is that along the third quarter, by the end of the third quarter, we may reach the nominal capacity. I would also like to mention that pulp inventories have raised. They've been 54,000 tons by the end of last quarter, and they climbed to 62,000 tons. They are now at 42 days. But, actually we have increased inventories mainly on accumulation for the yearly maintenance in order to serve our customers during the yearly stoppage of the pulp mill. Concerning the cash cost. The cash cost actually raised and this is a deliberate policy for bringing wood supplies from third parties. The average distance has raised also to 350 kilometers as opposed to 215 kilometers at the same period of last year. We are bringing our wood supplies representing roughly about 20-25% of our needs. And what we are doing actually, is to save our wood resources for a possible future bottlenecking. As you know we have a possibility in the near future to do with the bottlenecking, which we estimated between 150,000-200,000 tons. But we can only do that if we have enough wood supplies. So we are saving our forests for that purpose. In addition to the wood costs, but, just to finalize on the wood costs, I believe that due to this strategy, Thomas, we may continue having this kind of average distance and this kind of proportion from third parties along next year as well. So that we have enough wood for the bottlenecking. Concerning other costs, and focusing on materials, we had also an increase in chemicals, mostly caustic soda, on account of prices which had raised in the international markets. And also on account of contracted supplies for peroxide and ozone. In view of the learning curve effect on the take or pay arrangement. So, these raw materials have a take or pay arrangement as long as we don't produce a nominal capacity, we of course had to pay for the full quantity of these raw materials. So, this has affected somewhat, the cost during the second quarter. And other variable costs, we also had additional costs associated with the new recovery boiler, where [inaudible] has been temporarily replaced by natural gas. Our learning curve adjustments have been introduced. On fixed costs, we had a reduction associated with the higher volume. So, this actually covers every item of the cash costs. 5 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Thomas Sosa - Merrill Lynch - Analyst Raul thank you very much. And could you, or maybe Valdir, explain the selling expenses that they were quite high despite stable volumes. Could we-what should assume going forward, is it 10% of net revenues, or can we assume that there were some unusual items that impacted some expenses? Raul Calfat - VCP - CEO Tomas, Valdir is going to answer, but we don't have a percentage actually. But Valdir is going to give you a comment on our freight expenses which have affected variable costs. Valdir Roque - VCP - CFO Thomas, let me comment a little bit on this. [Selling and market] expense, you see, is higher expense [inaudible] with $2m being the effect of the lower [devaluation] on the Real, the [pressure] of the [devaluation]. And the $2m is basically regarding higher freight costs, along the period. Okay. Regarding general and administrative expense, you can see this difference is mostly regarding the effect of the devaluation of the Real [appreciation]. Thomas Sosa - Merrill Lynch - Analyst Fair enough. Thank you very much, gentlemen. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, as a reminder, if you would like to pose a question, please press the (*) followed by the (1) on your touchtone phone now. Again, ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to pose a question please press (*) (1). Our next question comes from Mr. Eduardo Valentine [ph] with [inaudible]. Eduardo Valentine - - Analyst Hi how are you, this is actually Christiano [ph], good to talk to you. Can we understand then about what you mentioned about the bottlenecking, that you decided to go through with it? And if you have, could you give us some more details on the CAPEX and expected timing for the new pulp capacity to go online? And, it wasn't quite clear to me the tradeoff of buying, now, third party wood, to conserve the wood that you would need because of the bottlenecking. Couldn't you do the opposite and use your wood now, and then after the bottlenecking buy from third parties? It wasn't really clear to my why the tradeoff is positive the other way around. Valdir Roque - VCP - CFO Thank you Christiano for the question. Actually, we have no decision taking place so far for the bottlenecking. But we see a clear opportunity in the near future. Once we get some [inaudible] on our pulp line, which we expect to have by the end of this year, we are going to watch closely all possibilities for the bottlenecking [within] our profits and equipment. And then take a decision for the [profit side], when the market permits this additional quantity. So by that time we will have a decision being made. We estimate that the cost for this additional capacity will be lower than $500 per metric ton per year. So, a very attractive project. We have decided to bring some wood at the moment, from third parties because there was an opportunity and the cost was also attractive, although we have this burden of the average distance affecting the final cost. But we think that by buying this wood at this time, and saving our forests, would be a better decision for reducing costs overall and also for allowing the bottlenecking, if the market permits at the proper time. 6 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Earnings Conference Call Christiano - - Analyst Okay. I got it. Another question concerning your capital structure and your debt level. Considering that you pay because of the fiscal structure, that VCP is set up in. Since you pay 35% in income tax on financial revenues, do you think that it is the best idea right now to start reducing that debt and accumulating cash? Or would it be wiser to maybe increase the dividend payout, lower the cash position, the gross cash position, so that you wouldn't have to incur any very high taxes as the financial revenues take place? Valdir Roque - VCP - CFO It's a very good comment, Christiano, but I should explore a little bit more the explanation regarding, the explaining of VCP. Remember when I said that if financial-financial increased the tax about 34%, but that's all part of overall tax planning. Remember that in [inaudible] you are being taxed 3% of sales, but, when you create a [inaudible] [inaudible] we move all the cash and all the expenses to the back. That means, this amount has been compensated to other-to avoid the 34% on the financial revenues. Because that has been taxed in real, real terms-not [inaudible] Okay? Christiano - - Analyst That's right, that's right. I remember that now. Valdir Roque - VCP - CFO Yeah, we have [inaudible] VCP but we don't have a [inaudible] in that. That's the reason what we're tax planning now, is working very good. You know? Christiano - - Analyst Perfect. Yeah. Valdir Roque - VCP - CFO Okay, one thing compensates the other. Christiano - - Analyst Yeah. Thanks a lot. Valdir Roque - VCP - CFO You're welcome. Operator Our next question comes from Ms. [Daniella] [inaudible] with [inaudible]. 7 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Daniella - - Analyst Hi, good morning. My question is also regarding costs. After the downtime, due to some fine tunes, can we expect any cost reductions? Valdir Roque - VCP - CFO Yes, Daniella, for sure. As I mentioned, for this period of time, not on wood, but on other items. Especially in chemical products. So, what we expect is that by the end of the year, chemicals will represent a saving of something around $7 per metric ton on the current level. Daniella - - Analyst Okay, thanks. Operator Our next question comes from Mr. Thomas Sosa with Merrill Lynch. Thomas Sosa - Merrill Lynch - Analyst Just as a follow-up. Could you confirm that the company continues to expect a target sales of paper of maybe 580,000 tons for this year, and 700,000 tons of pulp-market pulp? Valdir Roque - VCP - CFO Yes, Thomas. We are considering something around those figures. Thomas Sosa - Merrill Lynch - Analyst Okay, and you mentioned CAPEX for this year will be something like $190m. Do you have a sense of what CAPEX is for 2004 please? Valdir Roque - VCP - CFO We think that for 2004 it will be something like $130m not considering new initiatives. Thomas Sosa - Merrill Lynch - Analyst I'm sorry, how much? Valdir Roque - VCP - CFO $130 dollars, but this does not include any new initiatives. Thomas Sosa - Merrill Lynch - Analyst Okay, thank you very much. 8 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

CORPORATE PARTICIPANTS Larry Sala Anaren - Chairman and President and CEO Joe Porcello Anaren - VP Finance CONFERENCE CALL PARTICIPANTS Rich Valera Needham and Company - Analyst Sandy Harrison Pacific Growth - Analyst JD Abouchar Pacific Edge Investment Management - Analyst Kevin Dede Marilyn and Company - Analyst George Iwanyc CIBC world Markets - Analyst PRESENTATION Operator Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Anaren fourth quarter earnings release. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for introductions and opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Larry Sala, President and Chief Executive Officer of Anaren Incorporated. Please go ahead, sir. Larry Sala - Anaren - Chairman and President and CEO Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for participating in the Anaren fiscal 2003 fourth quarter conference call. I'm joined today by Joe Porcello, our Vice President of Finance. I will provide an overview of the results of the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended June 30th, 2003, after which Joe will review the financial highlights. We'll then take your questions. The statements contained in this conference call which are not historical information are forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed. You are encouraged to review Anaren's fourth quarter press release, Anaren's form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30th, 2002 and 2003, Anaren's form 10-Q for the third quarter ended March 31st, 2003, and exhibits to those reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to learn more about the various risks and uncertainties facing Anaren's business and their potential impact on our net sales, earnings and stock price. Net sales for the fourth quarter $19.4m, up slightly from net sales of $19.2m for the third quarter of fiscal 2003. That loss for the quarter was $3.5m compared to a net loss of $1m for the third quarter of 2003. The net loss in the fourth quarter included a net loss at [inaudible] Europe of $3.9m, of which $1.4m is attributed to the restructuring charge for the work force reduction and $2m which is a fixed asset impairment charge due to the previously announced decision to dispose of our Anaren Europe operation. Anaren Europe net sales for the quarter were $900,000 and are included in our Wireless Group net sales. Excluding the results of Anaren Europe, net sales for the fourth quarter were $18.5m, the net income for the quarter was $440,000 or $0.02 per diluted share. The decision to dispose of Anaren Europe resulted from the decline in revenue and the continuing financial losses of that operation, despite efforts to capture new business, new orders at Anaren Europe have been negatively impacted by the continued overcapacity in the printer circuit board industry, the desire of our wireless customers to source this type of technology in Asia and also negatively impacted by the appreciation of the euro. It's anticipated that Anaren Europe operations will cease during the current first quarter and that the liquidation of assets will take place during the second and third quarters of this fiscal year. We believe that the cash generated by the liquidation of Anaren Europe assets will be sufficient to fund the expenses incurred in disposing this operation. 2 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Wireless group net sales for the quarter were $12.7m, up 9% sequentially from the third quarter. Wireless market demand remains weak and visibility still remains limited and sequential growth in wireless net sales was driven by increased demand for our backplane and resistive products. We continue to benefit from our broad market penetration and our customer diversity. From our customer concentration standpoint for the wireless group as percentage of wireless group net sales; Motorola was 15%,Ericsson was 14%, PowerWave (ph) was 11% and Lucent was 5% during the quarter. We believe the 802.11 Femto series balance product line that we introduced in the third quarter has been positively received in the marketplace. To date we have achieved reference design wins with four leading chip manufacturers and continue to invest in new product development to expand our 802.11 product offering as well as our dollar content. For the Space and Defense Group, net sales for the fourth quarter were $6.7m, down 8% sequentially from the third quarter of fiscal 2002. Space and Defense Group new orders for the quarter were $4.2m, including follow-on orders for ground-based radar antenna distribution networks, as well as our airborne location subsystems. Space and Defense backlog at June 30th, 2003 was approximately $26.3m. Joe Porcello will now review the financial highlights. Joe. Joe Porcello - Anaren - VP Finance Good afternoon. The financial highlights of the fourth quarter income statement and the balance sheet at June 30, 2003, are as follows. The gross profit margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 was $24.6%, 160 basis point decrease from gross margins of 26.2% in the third quarter of fiscal 2003. Gross margins declined due to the inventory write-down included in cost of sales as part of the restructuring in the fourth quarter at Anaren Europe. Going forward in fiscal 2004, we expect to see some improvement in gross margin as a result of our past and ongoing cost-cutting efforts. Investment in R&D was 7.3% of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2003, compared to 9.3% in third quarter of fiscal 2003. R&D expenditures have declined in both actual dollars and as a percent of revenue from third quarter due to amplification of additional engineering personnel to work on customer-funded design opportunities. The impairment loss and restructuring charges in fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 totaled $3.9m, compared to $1m in third quarter of fiscal 2003. The amount of impairment loss and restructuring charge related to the anticipated disposition of our European subsidiary was $3.4m and included an impairment charge of $2m, a restructuring charge and cost of sale of $428,000 and operating restructuring charge of $1m. The loss from operations was 20.5% of sales in fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 compared to loss of operations of 7.8% of sales for the third quarter. Operating margins decreased due to $3.4m restructuring and asset impairment charge reported in fourth quarter related to the anticipated disposition of Anaren Europe. The company is continuing to review all opportunities to reduce cost whenever possible. These reductions are expected to provide improvement in fiscal 2004 operating margins despite anticipated lower sales levels. The net loss was 7.8% of net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. This compares to net loss of 5% of net sales for the third quarter. On per share basis, the diluted per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 was $0.16, this compares to loss of $0.04 per diluted share in the third quarter. Excluding the results of Anaren Europe net sales for fourth quarter were $18.5m and net income was $440,000 or $0.02 per diluted share. It is anticipated that Anaren Europe will cease manufacturing operations in the current first quarter of fiscal 2004 and that the liquidation of assets will take place during quarters two and three. All revenue expenses associated with this operation will be reported in the future on one line as a result from discontinued operations as required by GAAP. Income statement dealing detailing the loss of Anaren Europe and results for fourth quarter and year, excluding Anaren Europe is included in today's earnings release. The balance sheet highlights include the following. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were approximately $128m at June 30, up $3m from June 30 of last year. Despite the loss we have continued to enjoy positive cash flow from operations in fiscal 2003. Cash generated by operations was approximately $12.2m in fiscal 2003 and came in part from $4.4mreduction in inventory and $3.8m reduction in accounts receivable. Accounts receivable were $9.3m at June 30, 2003, down $3.8m from June 30, 2002. Days sales outstanding at end of June were 44 days compared to 56 days at end of June, 2002. Despite the large drop in DSO during the quarter, we continue to expect DSO to fluctuate between 50 and 70 days as we go forward, depending on sales levels, customer mix and business conditions. Inventories at June 30, 2003 were $15.7m, down $4.4m or 22.1% from $20.1m at June 30, 2002. Capital equipment additions in the fourth quarter of 2003 amounted to approximately $600,000. The additions were mainly for production equipment at our East Syracuse facility to support a new military satellite program. Accounts payable at June 30, 2003 were $4.6m down $400,000 from June 30 last year reflecting the decline in material purchases. During fiscal 2003 we purchased 643,000 treasury shares in open market at average cost of $8.37. It is anticipated that we will continue to make open market purchases of shares for treasury under the current forward authorization depending on market prices. 3 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Larry Sala - Anaren - Chairman and President and CEO Thanks, Joe. Going forward as Joe stated, reported net sales will exclude Anaren Europe and the operation will be reported as a discontinued operation. Given the current uncertain wireless market conditions and the expected loss from discontinued operations at Anaren Europe in the first quarter of approximately $900,000, we believe first quarter net sales will be in the range of $17m to $19m and earnings per share will be in the range of negative $0.01 to positive $0.02. We will now take questions. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Operator Thank you, sir. If you would like to ask a question, please do so by pressing the star key followed by the digit 1 on your touch-tone telephone. If you are on a speaker phone, please be sure the mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. Once again, press star 1 on your touch tone telephone to ask a question. We will pause for just a moment to give everyone an opportunity to signal for questions. We will take our first question from Rich Valera of Needham and Co. Please go ahead. Rich Valera - Needham and Company - Analyst Larry, first for you. You mentioned in the wireless market visibility remains limited and the demand is relatively weak. Can you just comment on any incremental change quarter-over-quarter? It seems like there has been positive data points particularly out of North America with Lucent getting business and other developments. Anything you see that gives you signs there is some modest improvement here? Larry Sala - Anaren - Chairman and President and CEO Well, we've seen contract announcements, but as of yet, we haven't seen a follow-through in demand from recent announcements yet. So, that's something that obviously we're hopeful about and certainly a sign of more strength than we've seen in a while. But, we're still uncertain as to when we'll see a follow-through of actual purchase orders from those recent announcements. Rich Valera - Needham and Company - Analyst So, your guidance of $17m to $19m, the upper end would imply some wireless growth, is that correct? Larry Sala - Anaren - Chairman and President and CEO That's correct. Rich Valera - Needham and Company - Analyst Where would you expect -- is that coming more from incremental penetration by you and increased sales of new products or, you know, expected pick-up in demand? 4 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Larry Sala - Anaren - Chairman and President and CEO It's coming more from recent design wins that we have had that we anticipate will be transitioning into production either late this quarter or in our second quarter. So, we believe it's more timing related to recent wins we have. We are not right now projecting a large up tick in the marketplace as far as this first quarter is concerned. Rich Valera - Needham and Company - Analyst Those wins, are those on custom product side? Larry Sala - Anaren - Chairman and President and CEO Yes, they are. Rich Valera - Needham and Company - Analyst Great. With respect to the wi-fi (ph) components, last quarter you said you could see orders in the hundreds of thousands of units sort of in the near term. Can you update us on sort of expected order levels maybe in September or December for those components? Larry Sala - Anaren - Chairman and President and CEO That's the sort of volume we expect to be seeing on a monthly basis between roughly September and year-end. So, we're starting to see pre-production orders of tens of thousands now as the contract manufacturers are starting to move into volume production. We're seeing, as I said, forecasts on the order of 100,000 parts per month moving to 100,000 parts per week as we move into the season of building up for the holiday build-out. Rich Valera - Needham and Company - Analyst Great. Joe, with respect to gross margin, backing out the charges and the five-end stuff, looks like you were at 30 and-a-half gross margin in June. Could we expect that to go up in September? Joe Porcello - Anaren - VP Finance Yeah, I would expect to see improvement from all the restructuring we did outside of Europe. Rich Valera - Needham and Company - Analyst And on the opex side, how do you expect that to trend sequentially? Joe Porcello - Anaren - VP Finance I would expect we would come back down again from where we've been. Obviously if you take a look at where the G&A and the marketing and the R&D are running in the fourth quarter they should run somewhat in that neighborhood, but somewhat less. Rich Valera - Needham and Company - Analyst Great. If we were doing pro forma number backing out $900,000 cost of Anaren Europe, what would the tax rate be we should use for next quarter? 5 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Joe Porcello - Anaren - VP Finance I would say next year's tax rate will be in the neighborhood of about 24%. Really depends on which sub you are in. On average, if you use 24%, should be safe. Rich Valera - Needham and Company - Analyst One final question. Larry, could you comment on update on the Celeritek (ph) situation? Looks like they have a more friendly situation there with respect to any type of potential acquisition? Larry Sala - Anaren - Chairman and President and CEO Yeah, we have signed a confidentiality agreement with Celeritek in June. We are continuing to pursue and consider the alternatives available to us, as we stated previously in the last 13 D-filings. Rich Valera - Needham and Company - Analyst Thank you, guys. Operator Our next question comes from Sandy Harrison (ph) of Pacific Growth. Please go ahead. Sandy Harrison - Pacific Growth - Analyst Good afternoon, guys. Couple questions. Larry, you talked about your customers in the wireless sector. I guess your top four customers represent about 45% of your overall wireless business. Of the remaining 55%, who are some of those that are some of the up-and-comers and can we expect them to hit in the future any time the 10% level and do you see share shifts or anything going on amongst your customers that would suggest there could be rising stars or so forth? Larry Sala - Anaren - Chairman and President and CEO I guess second part first. Obviously with the distribution of our business the last quarter we've seen more strength recently with Motorola than we saw in the first three quarters of the fiscal year. So, they've strengthened somewhat recently. But, we don't have from any customers long enough term forecast to say how long that demand strength will hold up. From our other customers we've seen growth in our business with Nokia. They grew for us just about every quarter this last year. We would expect to see continued growth with Nokia, as well, as we go forward. The only other customer that has been of significance to us has been Nortel. Stronger, again, in the fourth quarter than they were in the previous three quarters. But, we don't have a lot of visibility to say where that demand is going in the future. Sandy Harrison - Pacific Growth - Analyst And then any rising stars out of the other 55% that we might look for to crack the 10% level? 6 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Larry Sala - Anaren - Chairman and President and CEO Beyond Nokia, I don't think we will see a customer expand to more than 10% of revenue. We are seeing pick-up in demand of direct business in Asia. But, I don't see any one customer seeing 10% was our revenue in the near term. Sandy Harrison - Pacific Growth - Analyst You were talking about the opportunities on the wi-fi product. Could you remind us sort of you're talking about hundreds of thousands of units a month potentially going to a week. Kind of remind us what is that based upon and what is your average units per or number of products per client perhaps and what maybe ASP we might be able to model out for this? Larry Sala - Anaren - Chairman and President and CEO I think we said in the past our existing product line is our balance series product line. We typically see anywhere form two to four design-win opportunities per application per unit. And ASPs can run anywhere from say $0.10 to $0.30 depending on complexity of product and functionality, particular balance functionality we are offering. We continue to try to expand the functionality of the products that we offer. We're continuing to prototype with customers and sample products to customers that have functionality beyond just the balance that would increase our dollar content substantially by potentially maybe 50%. So, typically what we've seen in this marketplace is from the time we bring a product to market until we see design-ins and strength is in the six to nine month range. So, the demand that we're expecting between now and Christmas is solely driven by the balance product line we previously announced and have advertised. Sandy Harrison - Pacific Growth - Analyst Got you. Just a point on clarification. When you had given the outlook or the guidance range for the first fiscal quarter, did you say that included or excluded the Europe operations? Larry Sala - Anaren - Chairman and President and CEO We exclude Europe from the revenue side. Europe is included in our EPS range. Sandy Harrison - Pacific Growth - Analyst Okay. Larry Sala - Anaren - Chairman and President and CEO So, the $900,000 loss in Europe is included in earnings guidance range of negative $0.01 to positive $0.02. On the revenue side, the $1m7 to $19m revenue range excludes any revenue contribution out of Anaren Europe. Sandy Harrison - Pacific Growth - Analyst Okay. Thanks. 7 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Operator As a reminder, if you would like to ask a question or if you have a follow-up question, please press the star key followed by the digit 1 on your touchtone telephone. We will take our next question from JD Abouchar (ph) from Pacific Edge Investment Management. Please go ahead. JD Abouchar - Pacific Edge Investment Management - Analyst Thanks for taking my call. [Inaudible] balance, is this type of device applicable also to any cellular application on the client side handset? Larry Sala - Anaren - Chairman and President and CEO Uh, the functionality is applicable to applications like handsets. We believe that the product that we have in the marketplace today is probably physically large for a handset type of application. We're hopeful next generation of that technology will be developed here that are fit the size, as well as the functionality of handset type of application. So, this generation of product, although functionally we think is applicable, we think physically we are a bit large for that application. JD Abouchar - Pacific Edge Investment Management - Analyst Okay. Next-generation product is six to nine months away? Larry Sala - Anaren - Chairman and President and CEO Yeah, I would say that is a fair estimate of time. We feel we are one design integration away from being size competitive for handset type of application. JD Abouchar - Pacific Edge Investment Management - Analyst [Inaudible] similar to the current product? Larry Sala - Anaren - Chairman and President and CEO Correct probably in that application toward the low end of the ASP that I gave. JD Abouchar - Pacific Edge Investment Management - Analyst [Inaudible] $0.10, but a couple [inaudible]? Larry Sala - Anaren - Chairman and President and CEO Right. JD Abouchar - Pacific Edge Investment Management - Analyst Just housekeeping. What was depreciation and amortization in the quarter? 8 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Joe Porcello - Anaren - VP Finance We haven't got that number right here. Call me later and I can give you that. JD Abouchar - Pacific Edge Investment Management - Analyst Great. Final question. You talked about design wins with four customers of the 802.11 products. Have you disclosed those customers, if you can't what percentage of the current market do they represent? Larry Sala - Anaren - Chairman and President and CEO We don't disclose actual customers in that marketplace. Now, best guess is we're talking about probably two of the four leading players with a large-- more than 50% of the market. JD Abouchar - Pacific Edge Investment Management - Analyst Got you. Thanks again. Operator We'll take our next question from Kevin Dede (ph) of Marilyn (ph) and Company. Please go ahead. Kevin Dede - Marilyn and Company - Analyst Would you mind refreshing my memory on the defense programs you guys are involved with and what you see as the outlook there? Larry Sala - Anaren - Chairman and President and CEO Sure. I guess just in general, our main product area on the defense side are radar antenna feed networks. We are largely involved with ground based radar programs such as FAD and variations of that platform. We provide location receivers for airborne applications and we have multiple airframes that technology is used on, Lamps (ph)Helicopter, [inaudible] and several other platforms. We build Jammy (ph) subsystems. Our main business there has been direct business that we do in South Korea as well as the Idecum (ph) program we have been on for many years. We build missile receivers, as well, all of classified nature. Those are the main applications of our defense technology. We've recently announced new work we are doing in military communication satellite applications. Those are the main drivers of our revenue in that space and defense side of the business. Kevin Dede - Marilyn and Company - Analyst So, you know, I can see that overall defense spending has gone up. Your stuff seems to be holding fairly constant. Do you see changes in that going forward or what is your general outlook for your niche? Larry Sala - Anaren - Chairman and President and CEO If we go back in time back through last fiscal year and prior, the big change in our space and defense business is that during the fourth quarter of fiscal '03, we completed our production work on the Space Way (ph) program. Space Way was our single largest contract. It was a commercial broadband satellite application. Our content in that program was on the order of $30m. It was a very large percentage of our backlog, two or three 9 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call years ago. We really haven't seen any significant demand on the commercial satellite market to replace that business. So, today our backlog is virtually solely defense. We've actually seen growth in our defense business. But, it has not been sufficient to offset that large Space Way program and so you know, we've seen good, consistent demand on the defense side. We're fairly optimistic that we'll see strong book-to-bill ratio again this year. Although we cautioned many times that the timing of defense orders can move significantly so, we're reluctant to really say with too much specificity as to when an actual defense order will occur. The defense business has been strong for us and we expect that to continue. Kevin Dede - Marilyn and Company - Analyst Okay. Thanks, Larry. Operator We'll take our next question from George Iwanyc of CIBC World Markets. Please go ahead. George Iwanyc - CIBC world Markets - Analyst Could you update what type of cost savings you expect this year and what you think that will bring break-even level down to? Joe Porcello - Anaren - VP Finance We took out approximately $5m worth of operating cost over the past year. So, we think the break even range is somewhere in the neighborhood of $58m to $60m now. George Iwanyc - CIBC world Markets - Analyst Okay. And for this coming fiscal year, what type of cost savings do you think you can also generate this year? Joe Porcello - Anaren - VP Finance Uh, we're still looking to take out some cost. Obviously won't be as significant as it was this year. I would think we would look for probably a $.5m to $1m more. George Iwanyc - CIBC world Markets - Analyst Okay. Can you maybe give us little bit more of an update on Asia, what the transitions are going at your facility there and just the general demand? Larry Sala - Anaren - Chairman and President and CEO Sure. Our China facility has ramped up the production of our Ferrite (ph) product line, which was our original reason for establishing our presence there, at least our first initiative as far as production goes. We are supporting the majority of our Ferrite assembly out of the China operation now. We are right now in the phase of transitioning some of our custom work into that operation. Initially it will be more of new production work that we have won over the last quarter or two that will be starting up out of our China operation and that we expect to have into production by the early part of October, so, right now the facility is continuing to grow. We're continuing to add staff both on the manufacturing side and the engineering side. By the end of our second quarter we should have a significant amount of custom production work going on there in addition to the Ferrite work that we're doing there now. 10 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Operator Once again, if you would like to ask a question or have a follow-up question, please press the star key followed by 1 on your touch-tone telephone at this time. Follow-up question from Rich Valera of Needham and Co., please go ahead. Rich Valera - Needham and Company - Analyst Joe, you mentioned you would report Anaren Europe as discontinued op for GAAP. Will you include the loss or exclude the loss when you do that? Joe Porcello - Anaren - VP Finance No, on a separate line, Rich. Down below income from continuing operations. It will be net of tax. It will include whatever small level of revenue there is in the quarter and possibly any tax benefits from shutting it down. Rich Valera - Needham and Company - Analyst Great. In terms of your sequential expectation for revenue in the Space and Defense business, do you expect that to be down a bit more at the $6m level going forward from September on? Joe Porcello - Anaren - VP Finance I guess right now it is our anticipation that the Space and Defense business will run in the $6m to $6.5m quarter range fluctuating quarter-over-quarter. Rich Valera - Needham and Company - Analyst Thank you. Operator At this time, we have no further questions. I'd like to turn the conference back over to the speakers for any additional or closing remarks.

Before we turn the statistics for the quarter, I thought I would update on two organizational matters of importance. First, with regard to our search for permanent CEO -- we 2 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved. Republication or redistribution of Thomson Reuters content, including by framing or similar means, is prohibited without the prior written consent of Thomson Reuters.

JULY 24, 2003 / 3:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q2 2003 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call are very pleased with the progress we have made to-date. Our Board is interviewing candidates for this position, and we believe will be able to complete this in the September, October timeframe. The second organization matter deals with our approach to sales and marketing. I took this position just now two months ago, we looked at our efforts to reach at marketplace and we have focused them on delivering industry and market and application expertise for our customers in prospect. Accordingly our sales and marketing, our customer and product support function are now all organized by market category -- antibody, food pathogen, agro products, and water products. In each of these categories, we maintain an outside sales force whose primary function is to direct -- is direct customer contact to generate sales leads and complete sale. This effort is supported with in-house sales support, product support, and customer service. Our customer service and product support functions are designed to be useful before joining and after the sale and in many of our sales situations benefits from this type ours support since our sales are typically technology driven. We believe the current structure will allow us to reach our target market more effectively with industry and application expertise necessary to enhance prospects -- our prospects for success. Additionally, we have begun to expand our international sales efforts. We have added direct selling resources in our European office -- a direct selling resource in our European office, and we are looking to expand distribution relationships in Europe and Asia. We believe there are significant sales opportunities internationally, particularly, in animal feed testing, for both genetically modified trade and proteins points for the transmission of [inaudible], and we are working to effectively capture market share. These changes will require additional spending over the levels expended in the first half of the year, and we are estimating a cost of -- an additional cost in the second half of between $200,000-$300,000. We believe though these investments will be very useful in being -- in reaching target market. I'd like to now ask Stan to go through the statistics for the second quarter and the first half 2002. Stanley Musial - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - CFO Thank you Art and good morning. Although Art will be going in greater detail, I'd like to begin the discussion with our revenues. Revenues for the second quarter of 2003 were $6.4m compared with $5.6m for the second quarter of 2002, an increase of 14%. And for the six months end at June 30th 2003, revenues were 12.9m versus 11.3m in the same period in the prior year, also a 14% increase. Antibody revenues increased 24%, $3m for the second quarter of 2003 compared to the prior year quarter and increased by 21%, $6m for the 6 months ended June 30, 2003 compared to the same period in the prior year. This increase continues to reflect the benefits of the consolidation of the production facilities completed in 2002 which has attracted new customers and the expansion of existing customers. Water Quality revenues increased 17% to $2.1m for the second quarter of 2003 compared to the prior quarter, an increase by 12% to the $3.8m for the six months ended June 30 compared to the same period in the prior year. The company continues to work with drinking water utilities as they assess their vulnerability to chemical contamination. Food Safety revenues increased 5% to $1.3m for the second quarter of 2003 compared to the prior year quarter, an increase by 13% or $3m for the six months ended June 30 compared with the same period in the prior year. Food pathogen test sales led by E Coli grew significantly during the quarter, while sales of the company's product to detect generically modified traits declined in the second quarter of 2003 compared to the second quarter of 2002 due to the continued reduction in StarLink sales. Now turning to gross profits and operating expenses; gross profits, that is total revenues less manufacturing costs, increased $895,000 or 34% to $3.6m for the second quarter of 2003 compared to $2.7m for the prior year quarter, and gross margins increased to 55% for the second quarter of 2003 from 48% in the second quarter of 2002. For the six months ended June 30th 2003, gross profits increased $1.9m or 36% to $7.2m compared to $5.3m in the same period in the prior year. And gross margins increased to 56% for the six months ended June from 47% in the same period in 2002. The increase in gross profits was primarily driven by the increase in product sales for the quarter in six months and lower manufacturing expenses. Manufacturing expenses decreased $54,000 to $2.9m for the second quarter of 2003 compared to the prior year quarter and decreased by $312,000 to $5.7m for the six months ended June 30th compared to the same period in the prior year. Decreases were primarily driven by the benefits realized from the previously discussed antibody production facility consolidation and the initiatives to leverage manufacturing capacity and improved production yield. Research and development expenses decreased $270,000 to $618,000 sales for the second quarter of 2003 compared to the prior year quarter and decreased by $310,000 to $1.3m for the six months ended June 30th compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher expenses in the prior year associated with the development efforts of the company's food pathogen and animal feed test. 3 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

JULY 24, 2003 / 3:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q2 2003 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased $66,000 to $2.6m for the second quarter of 2003 compared to the prior year quarter and decreased by $502,000 to $5m for the six months ended June 30th compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to previously announced initiatives to streamline operation and again the effect of the consolidation of the antibody production facility. Included in selling, general, and administrative expenses of $2.6m for the second quarter of 2003 is a $315,000 provision for severance-related expenses associated with the company's termination of its former CEO in May 2003. Pretax income totaled $309,000 for the second quarter of 2003 compared to a pretax loss of $928,000 for the prior year's second quarter. And pretax income totaled $821,000 for the 6 months ended June 30th 2003 compared to a pre-tax loss of $1.5m in the same period in the prior year. The net income for the first quarter totaled 200 -- I'm sorry for the second quarter totaled $211,000 or 1 cent per diluted share compared to a net loss of $547,000 or 3 cents per diluted share in the prior year quarter. The net income for the 6 months totaled $546,000 or 3 cents per share compared to a net loss of $920,000 or 5 cents per diluted share for the same period in the prior year. Now turning to the balance sheet, the Company had cash at June 30th 2003 totaling $3.3m up from $2.1m at December 31st 2002. The Company's current assets totaled $13.3m at June 30th 2003, and its working capital, that is current assets minus current liabilities, stood at $13.5m at June 30, 2003 compared with $12.5m in December 31, 2002. Also at June 30th, the Company had stockholders equity of almost $31m and had met and exceeded the minimum financial covenants required by its bank. Arth those were the comments I wanted to highlight and I'd like to turn it back to you. Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO Thank you Stan. And clearly growth across all of our market categories is something we are very excited and pleased about, and I wanted to now turn the call to talk about some of the operational activities of the quarter. But first I'd like to begin with our relationship with Bayer. During the quarter, they informed us of their intent to terminate the agreement whereby we were manufacturing devices to support their product development efforts for Repinotan. They informed us that principally due to the short shelf life of the product, it was their judgment that it would not be a commercially viable method. They also informed us that while various approaches to these funds may be available, their evaluation was that any such approach would delay their product development for Repinotan. We are disappointed in this termination, but this decision will not have a material impact on 2003 or 2004 results. We will be evaluating alternative applications of this technology, but our first priority will be to develop market -- the market for the products we currently offer in food and water quality. The next point deals with in the past several -- past few conference calls, there has been mention of work we are doing in research and development regarding our efforts on a new project. These efforts have been for a project --- I am sorry, the work has larger been a project to detect and measure tobacco-specific nitrosamines or TSNA, which is of increasing interest to the tobacco industry. The presently available message for the quantization (ph) of TSNA's are both complicated and costly; immunoassay based test may represent an alternative method that is rapid, inexpensive, accurate, and simple to perform. These tests could prove useful for quick and reliable estimation of TSNA levels prior to tobacco purchase and throughout the manufacturing process. Although this may prove to be large market opportunity, proof of concept of this technology has yet to be established, and it could be several quarters before we are able to estimate the commercial opportunity, if any at all. It nevertheless represents a very interesting project work or research efforts, and we will be providing additional information as it becomes available. Next I would like to turn to our food packaging category and begin to describe our progress with E. Coli. As you may remember the product was launched mid-year last year; the product side validations continuing through the second half. Commercial traction -- sales traction began first quarter and continued in the second quarter. In fact we are, based on what we see today, we are on our path to achieve the earlier estimate of 20%-25% penetration -- a run rate at a 20%-25% penetration rate of the $8m U.S market with E. Coli testing by the end of this year. We see meaningful -- we've accomplished this by expanding relationships with existing customers as well the attraction and addition of new customers. Also in the food pathogen category, our Salmonella program, our product for Salmonella and their evaluations by customers are continuing. During the second quarter we were able to demonstrate significant value of this product in a variety of specific applications. Based on this feedback, our plans for the second half of this year are focused on capitalizing our market opportunities, but the sales cycles are shorter, typically small customers or selected testing needs of larger customers. We expect the sales ramp could be slower than if larger customers were to adopt our protocols immediately, but the lead times sales decisions are much longer. By establishing sales transactions quicker, we believe overall market 4 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

JULY 24, 2003 / 3:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q2 2003 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call acceptance will begin sooner. Also, with regard to the reader, the instrument used to interpret test results; we expect to have -- we continue to expect to have instruments in the field before the end of this year. This capability will help us to eliminate subjectivity and the interpretation and will be very important in high volume applications. The next product in our food safety category is for the detection of unapproved proteins in animal feed or mad cow test. The market for mad cow testing in North America and North American policy with regards to the animal feed is in a complete state of flux since the identification of a mad cow in Canada. Food, feed and regulatory industries here are evaluating the adequacy of current policy and considering significant change. It is unclear this time where U.S. and Canadian policies and regulations will end up ultimately and we believe the current is working, focusing a great deal of attention on these issues and we are working to show the value to be gained by testing animal feed to aid in the prevention of mad cow disease. The food industry particularly is based with complex issues concerning their suppliers and we expect the sales of our test at commercial quantity to follow the confirmation of a unified set of policies and regulations concerning animal feed by the Food Feed & Regulatory Industry. We believe it may take the balance of this year for this situation to stabilize. The demand for testing appears to us that it will grow as a result of this experience, in the meantime we have stepped up for our efforts as I mentioned earlier in Europe where policy is more stable and we look for penetration in this category in the balance of this year. The next food packaging test message concerns an update on or [inaudible] products, we continue to expect this product to reach the market place in the fourth quarter with third party validations completed by the end of the year. I would like to also add to comment on our antibody business the growth in our antibody business is as I mentioned directly the result of our efforts to consolidate our operations and bring a first grade manufacturing facility to the market place and we are very pleased with that work in the second quarter. On to our GMO business, we are very encouraged with launch of new products by our customers including crop protection perform [inaudible] and further resistance in [inaudible]. We continue our leadership in this category and we expect sales to continue to grow this year for tests other than installing. We've also seen the rate of decline installing sales flow. And we expect sales will continue to decline at a rate of between 5% and 8% for the balance of 2003. Sales of GMO test other than [starling] are expected to be 2-3 times the volume of starling sales for a full-year 2003. In our water quality business we continue to see Microtox adopted in the drinking water industry. We now have over 180 Microtox or [Deltatox] units installed since December 2001. We initiated an evaluation of 4 additional major food manufactures during the quarter and we expect this evaluation to be completed during the third quarter with results available early in the quarter. We continue to believe Microtox in food has substantial opportunities and we are pleased to have an opportunity to demonstrate its capability. Similarly in the beverage industry we continue our work and products evaluation have shown a significant value for the Microtox technology, and we are working to continue to exploit this opportunity. Both in earlier calls we have mentioned our report on the environmental technology validation and navy project, and that work is continuing and we expect those results to be available in October. This data will be helpful in determining future sales trends with regard to this [substance] of our Microtox market approach. Those were the highlights of the operations. I would like to turn -- to open the question -- the conference for questions at this time. Well, operator.

JULY 24, 2003 / 3:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q2 2003 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO Good morning Ken, how are you? Ken? Operator I am sorry. Our next question comes from Mark Tenko (ph) with Sidoti. Please state your question. Mark Tenko - Sidoti - Analyst Good morning gentlemen. Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO Hi Mark, how are you? Mark Tenko - Sidoti - Analyst Good. I want to talk a little bit about McDonald's role in sponsoring the Mad Cow test and endorsing it. They seem to have the most at stake from a global perspective with their brand. They help [inaudible] develop this test. What is their overall right now and what is preventing them without regulatory requirements to insist that their suppliers be using some type of test to screen for these unapproved animal proteins. What's the obstacle there? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO Mark, as you remember, McDonald's does sponsor our work in this area and -- but as you know, we cannot speak about specific customer policies in any case. And those -- some of those questions are best for them. But what we can talk about is the food industry generally because they are a significant component of that, and the food industry, the beef industry particularly, is you know vitally concerned with safety of the food supply and the beef products consumed by the American and the North America and world population. And to the extent that the identification of this cow in Canada has shown that some policy needs reevaluation that all three of those industries food, feed and regulation -- regulatory are reevaluating policy. And that's really the state of the -- would someone like stand up and say, we would like no Mad Cow anywhere, sure. But what we are searching for is a set of regulations and policies that will ensure that result. Mark Tenko - Sidoti - Analyst Well, a food service provider which [inaudible] has endorsed to your E. Coli test in the industry. Why wouldn't there be the similar response for them insisting on the Mad Cow -- or whoever has endorsed your test for E. Coli, I assume were the same target market as the Mad Cow test. So why havent we seen some type of endorsement similar to that? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO In E. Coli, the testing regulations and the requirements for analysis are very clear. And therefore, we make a test that is very complete in its analysis for -- to those requirements. In Mad Cow, the policy is changing and is in a state of flux as a result of the recent identification in Canada. So, the food service industry, the regulatory industry are not yet clear on what they would like to specify testing for. So until those -- until there is greater 6 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

JULY 24, 2003 / 3:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q2 2003 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call clarification there, it is going to be a matter of changing requirement. We are working with those industries to show the value of testing with whatever ultimate policy is adopted, in [sure compliance]. That's where we see our role and our contribution in the development of these policies. Mark Tenko - Sidoti - Analyst Okay, and could you again go over the four international validations for Microtox? What-- are you talking about -- are these beverage companies, are these food companies? And could you give us an ideas as to the size of these as compared to perhaps your -- the Quality Sausage deal where they signed on for Microtox? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO Each of these four large food manufacturers and they make different food products, but they are collectively food manufacturers and they operate on a very large scale. But they are not beverage but they are food. Mark Tenko - Sidoti - Analyst This is in multiples of the quality sausage type deal, if they were to sign on? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO Yes. Mark Tenko - Sidoti - Analyst Thanks a lot. I'll hop back into queue. Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO Okay. Operator Our next question comes from Ken Trbovich with Unterberg. Please go ahead. Kenneth Trbovich - Unterberg - Analyst Can you guys hear me? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO Yes we can hear you Ken. 7 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

JULY 24, 2003 / 3:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q2 2003 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call Kenneth Trbovich - Unterberg - Analyst Sorry about that last one. Congratulations on the quarter. It's good to see the things have continued to improve and to that end, I guess, I would like to find out what happened in the final four weeks of the quarter since it seemed you had warned about the potential of the shortfall and clearly from the results this morning that's not the case. What was it the change in the final few weeks of the quarter and do those trends continue now in the third quarter? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO First, we saw an increase in activity in the final weeks, we are looking for stronger sales in the second half of the year, Ken; we saw two types of activities. One is an acceleration of demand, which we had been expecting out of the third quarter as there was some movement into the second from the third and then other was just increase in demand. Kenneth Trbovich - Unterberg - Analyst Okay. And then with regard to gross margin improvement I know I asked this on the last call, I figure I will be the dead horse and ask it again. You know, you got two quarters of very good gross margin relative to historic levels. Based on what you are saying in the press release that would suggest that you know certainly the issues of mix being known that the margin are to at least be sustainable at the current level? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO Correct. Kenneth Trbovich - Unterberg - Analyst Okay. And then just one other question to clarify did you say that those are four foreign food processor or four foreign customers that are considering Microtox? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO These four food manufacturers, they are actually all located here. Kenneth Trbovich - Unterberg - Analyst They are all domestic? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO Are global business is but -- Kenneth Trbovich - Unterberg - Analyst Sure 8 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

JULY 24, 2003 / 3:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q2 2003 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO Yes. Kenneth Trbovich - Unterberg - Analyst Okay and then just to clarify also, in the press release you referred to the food business and the overall performance of the business. From those comments, it suggest that the pathogen test have done to a point in terms of their sales, their actual sales if they are more than offsetting the declines that are being experienced in the GMO side as a result of starving. Am I incorrectly reading between the lines on the press release? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO That is correct. I hope it isn't in between the lines; that is correct. Kenneth Trbovich - Unterberg - Analyst Okay. And as it relates to the business from the standpoint of feed-testing and I know you had already commented on E. Coli, but terms of feed-testing, do you have a specific organization that's working the lobby organization or attorneys that are lobbying due to the industry associations or regulatory authorities, so that you get constant feedback about where these folks are in their discussions because I know there is a major meeting, I guess, taking place in October -- well excuse me, in August of some feed testing, and I didn't know to what extent and this is an annual meeting. I didn't know to what extent are you able to move those sorts of things quickly on to an agenda considering the relatively short timeframe that's had since the Mad Cow identification in Canada? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO The first part of the question was do we have our lobbying efforts, we have a direct selling and consultative selling effort underway and the primary movers and influencers of policy are the food and feed industry themselves and the regulatory kind of take the directive from that after a scientific evaluation, and we are working with all three constituencies to facilitate their analysis and scientific evaluation and we judge that to be a very useful role. Kenneth Trbovich - Unterberg - Analyst Okay. And then just one final question, I will go back into the queue. Could you explain what TSNA and why that's important to the tobacco industry? It's not obvious to those who of us not in the industry. I am just trying to figure out what is it first and then secondly is that a project that you are doing internally or one that's being paid for in terms of development by an outside source? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO The first part is what is the TSNA? They are the cancer causing or cancer-related proteins present along with nicotine in tobacco and there is a body of science dedicated at evaluating and understanding the concentrations of TSNA and cancer causing effects of tobacco, and they believe this by growing tobacco with fewer TSNA as we may have safer tobacco, less carcinogenic tobacco. The work we have done is sponsored research and we are under confidentiality provisions with regards to the identity of that sponsor, but this is a very early stage research work. Kenneth Trbovich - Unterberg - Analyst Okay. Thank you. 9 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Operator Our next question comes from Sam Berger (ph) with Lidwick Burk (ph). Please proceed with your question. Sam Berger - Ludwick Burk - Analyst Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO Good morning. Sam Berger - Ludwick Burk - Analyst Would you be good enough to comment on the second quarter percentage increase on both you microtoxin and pathogen test sales? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO With regard to microtoxin that is the grain test. The grain test sales are still small. We are continuing our efforts to bring our products to market and -- but they are still small at this time and we look for those to build over the coming quarter. Sam Berger - Ludwick Burk - Analyst And that pathogen? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO From the--. Sam Berger - Ludwick Burk - Analyst Is the pathogen test sales on the microtoxin? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO Microtox, what I just referred to. From a pathogen test sales, we were basically starting from a base zero. And the way we've described it previously is that we expect it to be at a 20%-25%. 10 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

JULY 24, 2003 / 3:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q2 2003 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call Sam Berger - Ludwick Burk - Analyst Right, I got that. Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO Penetration and we are on that ramp to gain that penetration before the end of the year. Sam Berger - Ludwick Burk - Analyst Okay. Thank you very much. Operator Our next question comes from Steve Spinger (ph) with Tiger Capital Management (ph). Please proceed with your question. Steve Spinger - Tiger Capital Management - Analyst Yeah. I have several questions, and first of all regarding the mad cow tests. I understand that McDonalds has sponsored the research into this product. And I understand that the various governments are in the process of formulating policy. What I don't understand is the notion that corporations around the world are waiting for bureaucrats to establish policy in an industry that has already suffered billions of dollars of damage. I am referring to the incidence that caused the drop of 40%-45% in the consumption of beef in the late nineties in Europe, and now the hundreds of millions of dollars suffered by the Canadian industry currently. I don't understand how it is that companies not exclusively McDonalds but others all of the companies [other] then the production of beef and kind of in the retailing of the beef, I am not concerned enough to be able to initiate tests regardless of what the government says, and I wonder if you could tell be about that? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO I can't. I can tell you what I know, of course, and that is it goes to the science and the transmission of mad cow disease. There is not a uniform accepted definitive conclusion as to what is the single or many agents responsible for the transmission of mad cow disease. It's obviously linked to a few things, and -- but those few things are not universally accepted throughout the world. We have a test that tests for many of those things. We offer that test and the testing that technology as a firewall as we describe it to assist in the prevention of the contamination of [inaudible] these materials. This food industry though looks at that and says, well I better start it before I start testing or before I consider testing I'd better be sure what I'm testing for is what solves my problem of being sure that this is not spread and not contaminated. And before we start testing, we should decide what it is we're going to test for. And I think thats what we're seeing in terms of policy evaluations and it's not -- I wouldnt interpret it as a bureaucratic effort at all, it is a scientific undertaking to evaluate what gets us the highest level of assurance and confidence in our beef and beef products, and I think thats what we're seeing and we're able to participate and facilitate by offering the benefits of testing once we identify those -- and that's how I would response. Steve Spinger - Tiger Capital Management - Analyst Well, if that's the case then what you are saying is that that it is not established, it is not established science; that the presence of animal proteins in animals -- in animal feed is a causative agent for mad cow disease, are you saying that? 11 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved. Republication or redistribution of Thomson Reuters content, including by framing or similar means, is prohibited without the prior written consent of Thomson Reuters.

JULY 24, 2003 / 3:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q2 2003 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO I am saying that the definition of those statements are the subject of continuing research; what is an animal, which animal, what part of an animal, which protein, and it's not the concept, Steve, the concept is accepted, it's the detail that are under scientific evaluation. Steve Spinger - Tiger Capital Management - Analyst Well, in any event the test that you announced had been approved in Europe or that had met -- I guess it had been approved in Europe by whatever organization was that you decided. Was a test that was far more rigorous than the requirements -- existing requirements in the United States by fact of [inaudible], I recall. The tolerance level varies one-tenth of 1%, the tolerance level here is 1%. In Europe the --your test is approved for all animal protein, I believe not only mammalian protein as is the requirement in the United States. Therefore, the test that you have -- that it's been approved is one that would go across the spectrum. What I dont understand is we keep having this discussion about McDonalds, you can talk about even so on, but McDonalds is not the only company in the world involved in the food business. And since there has been -- there is an open question as to the marketing efforts of this company such that the Board of Directors saw it necessary to fire the former CEO and founder of the company. It is almost inevitable that we as shareholders would question the marketing efforts of the company given the recent turmoil that has been ascribed to the failure to sale -- for sales and marketing. And so, what I would like to see as I would like to see greater clarity coming from the company about what the efforts are across the spectrum instead of cryptic comments about the industry, I mean there are -- you say that you are going to expand in Europe because they are the bureaucratic where the government regulations are more settled. I dont understand exactly what that means? I don't understand what -- why -- what are the other companies that you are working with? And how many other companies are you working within United States to market this product, this test? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO I would describe it, Steve, as the way I have described it, and we are reaching out and approaching the food, beef, and regulatory industry and any components thereof, so it's not any one company it's many companies. I would like to explain that the total volume of testing for these proteins, for these products and the industry today is very small and what we are advocating is a change in that policy to begin to test for these things that they are not testing for now. And we are explaining the merits of that, but it's not such that we are not calling on the right people. They are evaluating the merit of testing in relative to the scientific findings and support for the particulars and the items that we have defined as the subject for our tests. Steve Spinger - Tiger Capital Management - Analyst How many companies are evaluating your product currently? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO I dont know the number but it's many. Steve Spinger - Tiger Capital Management - Analyst I mean many 10 or 100 or 1000? 12 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

JULY 24, 2003 / 3:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q2 2003 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO Ten, many ten-- tens of Company, but they are a large, very large global operations. Steve Spinger - Tiger Capital Management - Analyst But I hope that, Arth, that you will be a little bit more forthcoming about these developments. I mean when we see what's going on in Canada and the turmoil that is causing and we have a test which validated, and there is nothing that comes out from the company in anyway explaining this that I would accept on these calls once a quarter. It's discouraging and it certainly raises the question about the Company's ability to sell their own products. Their own products if they have this potential, so more timely information would be appreciated. Moving to the water quality, there was no mention in the press release of the beverage manufacturers that had previously been sighted -- the beverage producers that had previously been sighted as undergoing validation tests. On this call you will simply refer to significant value that's being created. I would like to know how many large beverage companies are testing the products, who are they? And if not by name I would like you to characterize them, and I would like you to explain how it is that they would use the test, how they see the test as being something that would create significant value for them? Would it be used in the production process, would it be used in the retail process? I will give you a simple example. Carbon dioxide is delivered to McDonald's stores where they blend the carbon dioxide with the Coca-Cola syrup and water. If these companies are not testing the water is that a market that you see as -- for your products that is to say testing the water at the local level for these retail establishments like McDonalds, Burger King etc; do you have any products currently being tested by companies in this kind of the situation, that is, at the retail level? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO You've asked many question Steve I' am going to try -- I am going to begin with the last one you asked. Do we have customers using at it at the retail point, yes they are; and we don't have any one currently using it at the retail point of sale, but some of the customers who service and provide to that retail point of sale are evaluating our product for use there, although they aren't currently evaluating it today. The first part -- another question in your list was how many beverage companies and what nature are they? There are fewer than a hundred, but a large number of beverage companies will operate on a global scale, who are looking at our technology -- first as a way to have greater confidence in the ingredients that go into their product, that is testing the water that comes into their manufacture of their operation. In the course of our discussions with them, we explore other uses, but what we were trying to establish is the value at that first point in the chain and then go on from there. Those evaluations are going on now and we have great -- we are very excited about that; we think its a great potential. And when we have a news item that we can disclose, we will be very anxious to do that. Unfortunately. this concerns the integral operation of our customers and there is not a great deal of interest in describing in detail these procedures of their manufacturing process, but we can work together to see what kind of information we can come up with. This is not the first time we have brought that subject to you and I know it's not what we would all like, but it is a fact of our business in testing in analytical tests. Now those are the key questions I took from your list, Steve, did I miss any that we should come back to? Steve Spinger - Tiger Capital Management - Analyst Well, what I would like to know is that, if you could tell me about the retail part of that, I mean, since you do have a relationship with McDonalds and since, you know, you can insert another name for McDonalds -- I mean, you have said Burger King. The question about water testing is it's becoming a greater and greater focus in this country. And what I am wondering is, since you are testing or you have evaluation programs with the beverage producers at the production level, that is, to say presumably in a bottling plant, for example, or canning plant where they are producing the product with their own water input. Could you tell me about the discussions that you've had with any or all of these people to regarding testing at the local level -- McDonalds has 30,000 retail stores, Burger King has x, so that's obviously a large market -- I am interested in what the attitude is there, a? And b, you said that you have companies that supplies these companies, would that be for example of the carbon dioxide supplier type person -- you are having discussions with them about possibly using a test at the local level? 13 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

JULY 24, 2003 / 3:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q2 2003 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO We are talking with suppliers to food service and food distribution, food [inaudible] yeah, and that could include, if we dont have a particular relationship at a carbon dioxide company, Steve, but certainly we're describing the utility of this technology and technique at many, many levels of operation within these very large operations. So when we speak of suppliers, we are thinking of the component, the manufacturing process into finished food products, as an initial contact. Then we go on to point of delivery retail and retail application, and it goes very rapidly throughout the entire network because water is used everywhere. So, yes, we are discussing and describing the value here at various points in the customer's chain and we are -- there is an awful lot of interest. Steve Spinger - Tiger Capital Management - Analyst So, are you having discussions about initiating point of sale testing? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO Not initiating, we are talking about point of sale testing. But we havent -- we are still at the earlier stage of let's talk about our internal manufacture -- our raw materials, our supplies, our foods. Steve Spinger - Tiger Capital Management - Analyst But the companies themselves are exhibiting an interest in moving to that point, is that correct? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO Well, they respond to a suggestion, yes. They are interested, water is a very key ingredient and it is everywhere. Steve Spinger - Tiger Capital Management - Analyst All right. How many utilities currently are using your Microtox test? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO There are 180 Microtox or [Deltatox] in drinking water applications now. Steve Spinger - Tiger Capital Management - Analyst But in the previous call, I think that there was number -- I believe it was something like 55 utilities that had -- that were using Microtox testing. And you had stated that there was one state that had it was using -- had implemented the test state wide, is that correct? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO Yeah. 14 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

JULY 24, 2003 / 3:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q2 2003 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call Steve Spinger - Tiger Capital Management - Analyst What I would like to know is what is the value? What is your estimate of the value in testing revenues from that one state? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO In orders of magnitude, it is less than $1m. The question becomes how does that state implement across all other places as water is a regulatory concern. And therefore, we've not been able to calculate -- you know, we can calculate the number of water connections within the state and so on. But you know, that is a very same analysis we've done with -- you [inaudible], Steve, with regard number of utilities that service more than 10,000 household. Stanley Musial - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - CFO Yeah but what we have seen is an adoption by -- more by the drinking water utilities rather than a state. We don't see a -- we have seen one state and interest among other states, but typically the interest is passed on to the operating units within those states as that is the more typical approach to this analysis. Steve Spinger - Tiger Capital Management - Analyst So how many states have adopted state -- "state wide testing?" Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO Well "state wide testing" is what is stumbling, Steve. One state has adopted Microtox as their method for testing water. But that state is using it in their water treatment and water production facility. Steve Spinger - Tiger Capital Management - Analyst Have any other states adopted it on that scale? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO No. And we are in discussions but none others have. Steve Spinger - Tiger Capital Management - Analyst So in terms of the previous guidance of 55 utilities, can you tell me how many utilities are using the product now? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO Yeah, I believe we've added 11 during the second quarter, so that will bring us to 66. 15 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

JULY 24, 2003 / 3:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q2 2003 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call Steve Spinger - Tiger Capital Management - Analyst Okay. I have one more question, and then I will get back into the queue. During the quarter, you announced that -- sorry on this conference call, you announced that the Bayer relationship had ended. On previous calls, there had been reference to Bayer notifying the company that to be prepared to produce 1m tests, is that correct? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO We received that now. There is no formal notification to be prepared to make 1m tests. Steve Spinger - Tiger Capital Management - Analyst No, I know there was no formal notification, but there was some -- if not formal then some other form of communication to you that you reported to the shareholders that to be prepared to produce 1m tests whenever they would be going to production? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO Yes. We've asked for an indication of SARS and they explained that they expect [inaudible] more than a million doses per year. Steve Spinger - Tiger Capital Management - Analyst Right and that would have been [inaudible] at some where around ten bucks a test, is that right? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO Yes. Steve Spinger - Tiger Capital Management - Analyst Okay so in other words thats a $10m roughly a $10m opportunity. Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO Yes. Steve Spinger - Tiger Capital Management - Analyst Now is this news I  the information that relationship had ended came on this conference call; however, there was a rumor around a month ago that this had happened. And my question is, if something that has a theoretical value of $10m to the company occurred back in June, which is when I would guess that you receive notice about this, why did you not issue a press release about it, and where I am going with this is, is that youve added 11 utilities, for example, to the total of 55, theres no press release. There is an absence of communication and what I would deposit is this. If the -- if Birkmeyer was terminated for failures in sales and marketing and that's all that was ever discussed in the press release, there were three laudatory sentences I think by the Chairman of the Board is about Birkmeyer and after it was announced that he was terminated. During that period of time the stock has been very volatile. There have been all kinds of rumors about things. There have been no press releases. The press effort, the effort to communicate to shareholders is deficient in my opinion.

JULY 24, 2003 / 3:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q2 2003 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call believe they were limited there and I think the guy was a terrific new product guy, but I don't think that the effort on the part of the company to communicate what is going on in this company is adequate. I'll leave it there and get back in the queue. Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO Operator. Operator Our next question comes from John Fitzgerald (ph) with Bishop Rosen & Company (ph). Please proceed with your question. John Fitzgerald - Bishop Rosen and Company - Analyst Good morning gentlemen. Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO Good morning John. John Fitzgerald - Bishop Rosen and Company - Analyst Couple of things here. You know I think the product lines. I think everybody is in agreement. You certainly, you know, have sent things that have a great deal of promise. Let me address the marketing side at this thing, which continues I think the first grade people is you like a penetration, okay. Can you elaborate exactly the makeup of your marketing department? Who specifically is in charge of it? How is he or she answer to? Is it on a daily basis or weekly basis? What is the modus operandi used by the marketing department? I mean are they on a phone campaign? Do they go out and hit the bricks and go prospect to prospect on this? How larger marketing department do you have number one if you might answer that. Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO John we have today in our market and sales effort 35 -- sorry 29 people today. And we are organized as I mentioned along the industry line. The head of each industry group is what we refer to as a Business Unit Manager, who reports directly to me. And we for the next part of your question, was how do we go about the prospects of creating sales and we used a combination of direct selling technique to reach out and identify sales leads and follow those leads to completion. John Fitzgerald - Bishop Rosen and Company - Analyst Okay. If you could elaborate a little bit further when you say direct sales approach, what kind of specific direct sales approach do you use? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO Telephone contact, advertising, trade show representation, mail solicitation, every available method of generating [inaudible]. 17 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

JULY 24, 2003 / 3:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q2 2003 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call John Fitzgerald - Bishop Rosen and Company - Analyst I know what you are saying, but I mean there are a numerous potential contacts and the previous call [Steve Springer's] remarks about the market for these various products is endless. These guys -- people could be on the phones [24/7] and still not reach him everyday. Especially in the Microtox, the water product, okay, and the utility areas [inaudible]. Its just how aggressive a sales force do you have I think that's the questions being asked here? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO That's -- and I am going to respond. We believe we have the most aggressive sales force that is required. I mean we believe we'll meet the challenge. John Fitzgerald - Bishop Rosen and Company - Analyst Okay. And Ms. Calvino (ph) was put in charge to Europe back I guess 9 months ago. We've heard almost nothing out of that seg way over there. Can you give some comments on exactly what she is doing some accountability of where they stand in terms of their marketing efforts in Europe? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO The -- what [antop] responsibility for was largely a European office located outside of London, and the distribution relationships that were managed from there, and she continues in all of that capacity, what her assignment was -- was to figure out the best way to expand our presence abroad and that's what her task has been since she's taken that spot. John Fitzgerald - Bishop Rosen and Company - Analyst Okay. While she has been there nine months, what has she accomplished? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO Her recommendation in what we've implemented is we will continue to manage [both] distribution relationships augment, them in specific industries, food and [inaudible], add distributors in those areas but also add a direct selling effort where we can make a specific outreach campaign from our office there. John Fitzgerald - Bishop Rosen and Company - Analyst How large a marketing, sales force do you have in Europe? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO It is 4 people for the entire European--. Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO What we have [John] that's not there because we have a network of over 60 distributors, and if we included all of their resources, it would be quite substantial. 18 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

JULY 24, 2003 / 3:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q2 2003 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call John Fitzgerald - Bishop Rosen and Company - Analyst Okay, finally I had to pretty reiterate what Steve Springer said, it is very frustrating the vacuum of news, you know, certainly for the last quarter again the only news that we ever saw was they had fired the Chairman, and he is selling the stock. Okay, and there were some very good things that could have been highlighted a bit, and I do think you are coming up short on the press releases in keeping shareholders informed. The vacuum in news and the volatility of the stock gets everybody very nervous because the rumors as Steve just said have been flying hot and heavy and it's a disservice to us right now. We are flying blind and we really would -- and using this public form we really would request of you guys if you could be much more forthcoming. In your press releases, we are not saying its fucked here always but you know, really you have had some things that you have not highlighted that, you know, could well have been highlighted, that were ups and significance, one is a negative, [inaudible] but the 11 utilities and so on as Steve mentioned I think also could have been included, so we would really ask you -- we went through the same conversation from the October to January period, we sort of repeated it again and the frustration level is very high because of it and we would just ask you guys to you know be more forthcoming on the way you stand on things, okay as we move along, okay and we wish you good luck. Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO Thanks. Operator Our next question from Brian Fanety (ph) with [inaudible], please proceed with your question. [Mr. Fanety]. Brian Fanety - - Analyst Yes, can you hear me? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO Yeah, Brian. How are you? Brian Fanety - - Analyst Yeah, how are you, how are you Stan and Arth. Good quarter, I'm just a little [inaudible] negative on the conference; I think you guys are doing a great job. I have a question and I don't know if it has been hit on just yet. The -- [inaudible] lot of questions just come up about the cost involved with his departure and the share overhang we've been discussed and back and forth. The one question I am getting from some of my clients who invest with me is, there going to be any technological or innovational or new product setback with the departure of Birkmeyer? And a follow-up, if any key people left or do you people think -- are thinking of leaving to go with him if in fact he leaves and starts something on those lines? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO We have a very capable research and development group headed by James Stave, and you know, we don't anticipate any significant product development setbacks as a result of this change. Employment here is stable and we expect it to remain stable. Brian Fanety - - Analyst And Jim Stave is definitely staying on? 19 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

JULY 24, 2003 / 3:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q2 2003 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO Jim's very interested in helping grow our business. Brian Fanety - - Analyst That's great. Okay just getting back to the separation costs involved with Birkmeyer, have you guys been able to put a handle on that yet still a ongoing negotiation? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO We have made a estimation on accruals of total of 315,000; the second quarter numbers on a pretax rate and that's behind us now. Brian Fanety - - Analyst Okay, got you. Thanks, Arth. Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO Okay. Operator Our next question comes from Alex Rodinich (ph.), please proceed with your questions and he is with Gilfred Securities (ph.). Alex Rodinich - Gilfred Securities - Analyst Good afternoon, gentlemen. Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO Hi, Alex. Alex Rodinich - Gilfred Securities - Analyst How are you? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO Good. 20 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

JULY 24, 2003 / 3:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q2 2003 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call Alex Rodinich - Gilfred Securities - Analyst Good numbers, basically all the questions that I had planned have been answered, but I just want to express truly the frustration of not receiving any news in the quarter and this is the same thing we've been going through in the cycle for the last 3 years, and I think 90% of people that have been on this conference call are positive on your company see the same thing that we see here in value-added product that you have. And basically, you said your marketing endeavors are there; you have a vast amount of people employed trying to get this market and get this product out there and sell it. Primarily, your company has just gotten free publicity from Canada for mad cow disease, we've had the terrorist attacks that I think have spurned every company to worry about water supply, the systems -- the question is why are we not getting there quicker, sooner; and why we are not getting shared information because a Company that is public usually, from my experience, shares positive results as well as negative results -- otherwise it should be a private company? And I am sorry I am not here to badger you but it is just sheer frustration on my end and I think everyone else on the phone can express the same sentiment? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO Alex I'd like to respond and-- Alex Rodinich - Gilfred Securities - Analyst I mean of course it seems we've been in a quite period for the last year; everything was a quite period. I understand you can't discuss certain companies, certain issues because of confidentiality agreements, but announcing 11 utilities -- saying we have 11 signed utilities in the last quarter without mentioning the names is also positive, you don't have to mention the names if they don't want to disclose it. But we are sitting here in the dark, all I know is that the stock of the Company -- stock has been volatile, that's not the biggest concern for me is the volatility of the stock -- it's whether you guys can deliver; and if that deliverance is there we can be patient enough. But I think you have gotten enough free advertising and the Company, I feel, hasn't utilized it to the fullest extent, and if you are we are no aware of it. Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO Okay the 11 utilities we have routinely updated in this form -- the form of our conference call and you know that's perhaps a mistake and we will look at that. With regard to Canada and the opportunity there, if the Canadian opportunity is driving the size of the testing market, it is a very important development with regard to future of our company. But it is not driving near term right now sale. It is causing the constituencies affected by that discovery to reevaluate their current policies; once that evaluation is complete it is our belief that tempting will begin and earn. And the question could become the Canadian news is driving the size of the market potential and that's very important long run requirement. It does create confusion in the short run; we are working through that. I take the collective comments from the conference call and we will endeavor to be more forthcoming in our news releases as we go forward. Alex Rodinich - Gilfred Securities - Analyst Thank you. Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO You are welcome. Operator We have a follow-up question coming from Mark Tenko (ph). Please proceed with your question. 21 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

JULY 24, 2003 / 3:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q2 2003 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call Mark Tenko - Sidoti - Analyst Could you answer two quick ones. One, has any evaluation of --whether it be E. Coli, Salmonella, Mad Cow, or Microtox over the past year been concluded where the customer evaluating the product said -- basically he just took a pass and said it was an unsuccessful evaluation? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO No. Mark Tenko - Sidoti - Analyst That has not happened on any front. Would you say and you put out some time lines with regards to when you expect a lot of these evaluations to conclude some time in the third to the fourth quarter of this year. Would it -- that would suggest that if we do not have positive results by year end with these evaluations some new customers [inaudible], could we infer that those evaluations were unsuccessful if we haven't heard anything by year end? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO Mark let's go back to how you are asking this question. For example the evaluation is aimed at does the test perform the function that we say it will, and that never -- we havent had a situation where it hasn't performed the way we say it will. Now in the case of Mad Cow, for example, some have said we preferred the European standard and we like that feature of your test and, you know, the U.S. standard is in a state of change. And until the U.S. party is stable, we are not prepared to proceed with the protocols for test. I answered that question as no we've never had someone who took a pass because our test didn't meet its evaluation criteria. Mark Tenko - Sidoti - Analyst Okay I would rephrase it and -- has anyone concluded an evaluation and basically made the decision not to purchase the test -- the test may have worked but they have concluded the evaluation and have decided not to purchase the test? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO They have decided in many cases to continue evaluating their policies and testing in general. Mark Tenko - Sidoti - Analyst Is there ever a point that -- which you look at a customer evaluation and right off and say this -- they are not going to take the product or is -- or [either] you continue testing indefinitely as still a potential. Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO Well, an evaluation may reach a point where further effort at this time while talking is evaluated or protocols are decided doesnt make any sense, and testing could take -- you know could stop, but we are interested in brining this technology and this value to every customer. 22 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

JULY 24, 2003 / 3:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q2 2003 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call Mark Tenko - Sidoti - Analyst Well, I think the point that we are trying to get at is at some point when does it look like things potentially would be materializing? If you have a test and you -- someone is evaluating it for six months to a year and we are still not seeing sales, at what point do we need to look at that and say maybe it didnt work out, and maybe something needs to be reproached? It would appear that by fourth quarter this year, evaluations on the Microtox and Salmonella should be concluded. That's how we think we would have sales you know at the end of this year and pretty strong 2004. And at what point would you look their evaluation and say maybe we are not going to have the sales we thought we could? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO You know I think when we get to third and fourth quarter or the first quarter of next year, we will be able to tell you the results of those evaluations and what we learnt from it. But during -- at this point in time, we dont anticipate that to be an outcome. Mark Tenko - Sidoti - Analyst Okay, thank you. Operator We have another follow-up question coming from Ken Trbovich. Please proceed with your question. Kenneth Trbovich - Unterberg - Analyst Hey Art. I just wanted to ask about the EPA evaluation. Will that evaluation hold with other government agencies like the Department of Homeland Defense or the FDA? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO We certainly believe that we will have an influence factor if not a straight referral factor. Kenneth Trbovich - Unterberg - Analyst Okay. And then help me out when we talk about food processors using Microtox, are they using the Microtox to check the water that's used in their process? So for example, if they make [beef stew], they're checking the water that goes in the ingredient or are they checking in some way, shape or form the actual food by diluting it in a liquid? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO Our efforts so far have been to test the ingredient, the water going into the manufacturing or the food product. Kenneth Trbovich - Unterberg - Analyst Okay. And is there any opportunity I guess -- or do you see any reason to trying to develop a broader test because I know today, Dow Jones is reporting that there is a -- the government is doubling the number of food inspectors and specifically in an effort to try to prevent intentional contamination. Do you see that as a market opportunity through a modified version of Microtox or is that really outside of the ability, the technology? 23 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

JULY 24, 2003 / 3:00PM, SDI.A^G20 - Q2 2003 Strategic Diagnostics Earnings Conference Call Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO It's definitely an area we are evaluating. But there are great complexities to be worked out before we know that there is a suitable opportunity for every possible food category. Kenneth Trbovich - Unterberg - Analyst Okay. Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO As you know, there is over 30,000 SKUs in the food -- and each of them is a little bit different and would like to have -- we will have to be able to analyze that very large number of sample type, the matrix. When the sample is water, you know, that we know how to prepare that sample and evaluate it. Kenneth Trbovich - Unterberg - Analyst Okay. And then just one final question and I apologize, very, very basic, could you explain the differences between Microtox and Deltatox? Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO Yes, Microtox is a like an office-based method, laboratory-based method. It goes into the production facility in their laboratory. Deltatox does field applications where you are able to take it out into the field and make an evaluation at the point of where the water is. Kenneth Trbovich - Unterberg - Analyst Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it. Bye. Operator Mr. Koch, there are no further questions at this time. Arthur Koch - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - President and CEO Thank you very much for joining us on today's conference call, and we look forward to the update on our third quarter numbers in October. Thank you all. Stanley Musial - Strategic Diagnostics Inc - CFO Thank you. Operator This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. 24 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

CORPORATE PARTICIPANTS Dr. Achim Kassow Comdirect Bank AG - CEO Andre Carls Comdirect Bank AG - CFO CONFERENCE CALL PARTICIPANTS Thomas Rothausler Sal Oppenheim - Analyst Alexander Plenck BGB - Analyst PRESENTATION Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Comdirect second quarter results 2003 conference call on the 1st of August 2003. [OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dr. Achim Kassow. Please go ahead, sir. Dr. Achim Kassow - Comdirect Bank AG - CEO Hi. Good morning everybody, this is Achim Kassow speaking. Andre and myself, we are very happy to host today's conference call. Welcome and we are very happy with THE obvious increasing interests in our stock, as well as in our business developments. So, we welcome all newcomers to this conference call, and a special warm welcome, which is obviously also due to the environment, in terms of the temperature, goes with those who are with us. First, this morning, we feel that we shall deal with our half-year figures. This is the main focus of today's presentation. But on the other hand, if you don't mind, we would also like to give you an update on our business model and also some sort of outlook for the months to come. At first, we will go for a management summary, this will be done by myself. Then, Andre will run you through the numbers in somewhat more detail. And afterwards, I will be happy to share with you some update on the business model. Well, you should have a hand out, which means the presentation that we have are put on the web and I will concentrate, just for your information, with my management summary on slide three only. So, with the remarks in the next three to four minutes these will deal with slide three only, and then Andre will go over slide four and the following ones. Well, first of all, an overall look on the second quarter of 2003, how well that ran. In brief, I think we had a very good run and I would like to focus on three points on that respect. First of all, have a look at our results; second point, have a look at our cost developments, and third to give a short update on UK. First, results. Half year, we showed a pre-tax profit of 15.1m euros, previous year, as you know, 2.5m euros, which means increase six times. We feel very happy with that development, especially when we look at also our global peers. To look at the Ameritrade, they showed an eight times increase in profits but had some mergers and acquisitions here in between. So therefore we feel on a stand-alone basis with six fold increase, we are quite happy. Second quarter only we showed 10.4m results, which is twice first quarter, also a very nice number. Overall, this is the best quarterly result since our IPO. Springtime, when we had our conference call, I stated that the first quarter we run more or less without any push effects from capital markets and it was a very strong sign of our overall profitability to be able to show 4.7m in the first quarter. Second quarter, apparently, we had a more favorable market environment, commission income increased. 2 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

AUGUST 12, 2003 / 9:00AM, CDBG.DE^K20 - Q2 2003 Comdirect Bank AG Earnings Conference Call Some of you might have noticed this is now the first time over five quarters that we can see an increase in commission income, so therefore also clear upturn which helped us to increase overall result. In parallel, when it comes to cost efficiencies, we feel that we are well on track and this is now the second key topic that I want deal with -- cost. You know that we acted on a very early stage; last year, we have taken some very difficult choices but we see nowadays the fruits of the seed that we have done last year. We see cost coming down significantly, and this year, we are underway with on going discipline. You might have seen already and Andre will come to that later, that cost in second quarter, more or less, literally same level than previous quarter and you have to keep in mind, despite increasing business (which means increasing variable cost related to trade), despite investments that we have been taken in developing our business model further on. Obviously, this shows that the operative cost efficiency of the company increased significantly. Well, having said something about results, about cost, now on for a short look at the UK business. We have reported to you several times of sustainable growth. That trend continued; we saw positive development as well, in the second quarter. We deepened our co-operation with last year's speed and we are very happy to share out some more details on that with you. Andre will come to that later on. So the overall conclusion for the first quarter is that in a weak market, we have done well; for the second quarter, in a better market, we have done even better. We see the sweet fruits of hard work that we have been doing so far. Hard work meant that we acted consequently in terms of cost, that we acted early and determined in terms of rebuilding the business model, reshaping the whole operation. Therefore, we feel well underway on our management target for the year 2003 that is to have the ability to pay a dividend to our shareholders. This is the overall view for the first and second quarter, means the half year report, and now I am very happy to hand over to Andre, which will commence to a slide, which obviously is some what updated, because as I have learned it. Oh no! He now tells me I should stop, therefore it is him. Andre Carls - Comdirect Bank AG - CFO Okay, thank you very much for that. Yes, as Achim said I want to go into a little bit more detail of our numbers and would like to start with the equity markets on chart number four. And obviously, the equity market gave us a strong support for our development in that quarter and what Achim just wanted to say, next time maybe we should have, instead of the SDAX, MDAX charts here and we stick to the DAX definitely, that regarding the market capitalization, we are one of the first candidates for the MDAX. But let us see how the decision goes within the next couple of weeks. Our share price developed very nicely, as you all know, from 279 at the beginning of this quarter to 660 by the end of this quarter, and you all might have seen this morning that we topped again at about 813. That was what I heard latest and we really think that this is a very nice development. Flipping now to chart number five, I would like to give you some more details on our customer base. On group's level, you see a very stable development, a slight decrease from 614,000 customers to 612,000 customers. What you can't see here is that we have got additional 7000 customers on group level, who opted for dormant accounts, free of charge. We explained that last time, so you had to add them, if you want to. The 612,000 customers consist more or less of a development of additional 4,000 customers compared to Q1 in UK, which means about plus 11% and in Germany a slight decrease of 1% to 571,000 customers. If I may switch now to chart number six, the orders executed on the German Securities market saw an upturn in second quarter by about 7%, compared to Q1. Comdirect itself has achieved about 23% increase to 1.6m orders, coming from 1.3m orders in the first quarter, which shows a very significant increase. The execution rate declined slightly from 85% to 81% and that's mainly due and we thinks that's positive news to pick up and execute trading, which has a lower rate of execution than, for example, Fund Saving Plan. 3 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

AUGUST 12, 2003 / 9:00AM, CDBG.DE^K20 - Q2 2003 Comdirect Bank AG Earnings Conference Call On page seven, you see that the market business development is also reflected in the rise of customer assets, the assets under management. And you see an increase of about 16% coming from 6.8b to 8.1b in Q2. This consists of deposit volume, which slightly improved from 1.92b to 1.94b. Then, a very major increase of about 30%, which reflects the portfolio volume and also a nice increase of about 17% regarding the funds volume. What we want to add here is also that we saw, as we did in recent quarters, nice net cash inflow of about 260m in the first six months. The major part, which might be even most interesting for you as I assume, is obviously the P&L on page eight, and here you will see that the earnings improved, as Achim already said, especially due to the brokerage business, which was the main value-driver, and cost bases remained stable though we saw much higher volumes. Coming to the earning side of the P&L, I would like to make a few comments on the commission income that was up by 5.1m on Q1 to 21m in Q2. Now that, as you know, is mainly due to additional 300,000 trades and some pricing adjustments we did in Q2. The net interest income remains stable with about 15.4m, but you have to bear in mind that we have got a positive result from financial investments of about 3m for the first half-year. Coming to the cost side, as already said, this remains stable on a half year comparison, though we saw huge decrease regarding personnel costs, it's minus 23%, on the other administrative costs it's minus 19%, and depreciation decreased by 33%, which shows the right trend as we see it and that is also reflected in the development of the cost income ratio, which decreased on half-year comparison from 97.2% on group level to 78.2% and you all know that our target, which we set for next year is about 70%. So, we think we are on a good way here. As always, and you see that on page nine then -- we want to give you an update on our Com One Programme For The Future, which seems to be fully on target. You know about our cost targets for this year, which we improved during the first quarter, already in 2002, we had cost base of about 138.1m and our aim is to reduce that by 13% to 120m and if you look at the first half of this year compared to first half of 2002, you will see a decrease of 22%, which shows that we are on track regarding this target. And that is also underlined by the development of the employees on full-time basis, which you can see on the right hand side. For Germany, at the end of 2002, we had 727 employees here; our target was 565 employees by the end of June, and we were even slightly lower than this plan with 556 employees by the end of June this year. If you add then 70 employees for UK, you see a group level of 626 employees. Achim already spoke about Comdirect Limited, and Comdirect Limited continues to be number three in the UK market, went up with trend obviously, you will see the development of customers on page ten -- the number increased to 41,000 customers, which means 54,000 counts. That's an increase 11% and even more interesting is the development of trade, which increased from 61,000 executed trade to 110,000 executed trade. So, an upward trend of 78% and that really shows the quality of customers we could gain in recent months, the asset under management [Inaudible] increased from 460m euros to 660m euros and this all translates into a 5% market share of retail trade on the LSE compared to 3.3% in Q1. And my final remarks go to the quarterly comparison of results on page 11, the profits from 'on-air' activities have increased, as you all know, by 121% to 10.4m. So, we think the first goal of sustainable profitability has definitely been reached. The return on equity increased from 4.9% in the first half of '02 to 5.3% regarding the first half of '03, and the after-tax profit went up from 2.4m in the first quarter to 6.2m in the second quarter, altogether 8.6m, as you have seen. So, one key remark on that is even though the markets are still far below the levels of 2000 (ph) , I think Achim pointed that out, we achieved almost the same profitability, which really shows where we are by today. Okay. Thanks a lot for your attendance and Ill turn it over to Achim again. 4 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

AUGUST 12, 2003 / 9:00AM, CDBG.DE^K20 - Q2 2003 Comdirect Bank AG Earnings Conference Call Dr. Achim Kassow - Comdirect Bank AG - CEO Yes. Thank you very much. Now, we get over to the second part of the presentation. Well, obviously, and this is how we see it. In the first half, we performed well, nevertheless, and you know that we always said that and we are still sticking to that. Nevertheless, there is no reason to lean back. Friendly markets have been nice; we have profited from them. But, on the other hand, we have to think ahead and this is what we again today want to share our views with you. We already stressed several times that we need an extension of our business model, and this leads me over to page number 13, where it's said that the key assets of Comdirect bank is our current customer base. This is very highly attractive, we have in Germany only approximately 570,000 clients -- we're up 42%, have a net household income of more than 3,000 euro. This is clearly an above average portfolio. I would even try to call it a brilliant customer portfolio, which much of potential to do more financial services business. If you have a look at the chart number 13, you see that the overall revenues per customer that you can make is more or less close to 1,500 whereas the direct banks and this holds true for Comdirect and average (ph) , can claim 200, 210 euro. Well, if you calculate that on the basis of our 570,000 customers, then the overall financial services revenue pool associated to that customer portfolio is close to 1b euro, whereas currently with our business model we can get only 120m. Therefore, this is our target to get more of that, to get more share of wallet and this is also [Inaudible] while we see room for profitable growth. Therefore, what we do, what our strategy is about, is to do more for our customers -- for customers that others really would like to have -- to create for those customers with real good future a banking model of their future, to create for those of sophisticated customers a bank of choice, a modern bank. In springtime, I've said a lot about customers' needs and wants and we explained to you the market research that has been done during that we found our customers wanted to do more business with us, that we should do that, that we can do that, that we also can afford the necessary investments Andre outlined -- profitability in our core business. Online brokerage is key for the investments because you want to finance that out of our cash flow. We have the cash flow and that's what we need to invest in the future. This leads us over to chart number 14, where you see the key elements of the three-pillar strategy of Comdirect in the future. Three business areas, which are Online Investment, Direct Banking, and Financial Advisory. In Online Investment, clearly our aim is to stay ahead of competition; Direct Banking -- we want to expand our offering; and Financial Advisory is a new business where we want to develop our future streams of revenues. Since last conference, we have done a lot and this what I want to show you in this slide numbers 15. When it comes to the Online Investment business, which is our core business, where we are a market leader where we claim for innovation and we have been doing a lot and the most obvious thing that we've been doing is the web site relaunch done at end of July. The key of this relaunch, the key of the concept is more personalization, more one-to-one experience for our customer, more transparency -- is of use to increase, is of use especially for those customers who have been with us for, say, the last one to two years, were the governing staffs (ph) behind the relaunch. However and I think, most of you have seen that -- in the beginning we faced several technical issues some irregularities and due to that, we've also seen our customer complaints, especially hard critics in chat rooms. I'm not quite sure if some of you have also been with the critics in the chat rooms because they are all anonymous. But this was clearly a warning for us, as the management team, to (inaudible) concept. And clearly this was not the type of launch that we were looking to have. However, this was reality and so was the reaction. 5 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

AUGUST 12, 2003 / 9:00AM, CDBG.DE^K20 - Q2 2003 Comdirect Bank AG Earnings Conference Call First of all, we strengthened customer service; we got really all people through the phone -- even Andre and myself have been there answering customer calls. You might think that this is not the most efficient way to deal with (inaudible), but on the other hand, we felt that it was most important to get customer reaction firsthand and also to show to our employees a total commitment to the overall service of the bank. However, we also did some very [Inaudible] within our IT infrastructure so that overall the most critical issues, sort of the so called 80 to 90 key things that we have to face were solved within the first three days after the relaunch. And up to now, we had still faced some other problem, minor but some bad links that we have in the site, which is clearly related to the fact that the site has more than 1,000 subcomponents. It's been, say, the largest financial services site in Europe. So, therefore we have this top force in place, which would solve the overall issues by the end of this month. However, when it comes to the key issues of our customers, which has been done already and however as we are here in the financial community, I'm very sure that I take the complaints of my customers very seriously. On the other hand, we have to look at the real currency. And real currency is transaction. So, lots happened to transaction when we did the relaunch and in the days after, and what we saw is for the first three days after the relaunch, we had a slight decrease, approximately down 11%, which is within the normal volatility of our business. Last week, we had been even stronger than before, which shows to us that when it comes to our business, when it comes to the half-currency, when it comes to transaction, customers clearly deal as they deal before. They accept the new system. They get used to it and we get more and more positive feedbacks. This is also what makes us feel we are on the right way. Second pillar is Direct Banking. Clearly, what we want to do is to create a superior offering for clever customers, for smart customers, for self-determined customers; we want to have them with us, not only for broking but for the banking transaction as well. Therefore, we need to create convenience in terms of first bank capability; we introduced the new current account; we have several packages for customers; they can have it without any charge if they spend up to certain amount of money each month, otherwise we have a reasonable-priced current account and we have also special offers, for example, for students and others. Therefore, it's our key interest to increase customer loyalty with our product. In parallel, we introduced fixed term deposits to the market that are doing well; we have no major marketing complaints around that, but still have given us positive response. You might have seen from overall numbers and you also came to that -- that our deposit base grew quarter-to-quarter, which was not the case in the quarters before, so, therefore also we see a sort of some stabilization of the development. Third pillar is Financial Advisory. You know that our approach is holistic, independent for life, it sounds great. These are the obvious stages that you all know and we already said that the key belief behind that is that we will do that with top people. I said last time we had the top management on board. We had the 100% daughter company, our legal [Inaudible] on AG. We have the board of that AG already in place. Now, I want to give you a short update on consultants, products, and locations. First, consultants, meaning the people, should do the business. We have some advertising around that we are looking for those; we had positive response and there was only one national advertising that we did, searching for consultants. We received more than 100 applications for that with really smart guys from companies like Credit Suisse, like Deutsce Bank Private Banking, like NRP (ph), like for the former Advance Finance [Inaudible]. 6 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

AUGUST 12, 2003 / 9:00AM, CDBG.DE^K20 - Q2 2003 Comdirect Bank AG Earnings Conference Call Therefore, we see actually no problems in recruiting the right people. Second is about products. I informed you that we have been doing a beauty contest among all insurance providers in Germany. This beauty contest is done. We are now currently finalizing the concept. So therefore today, I cannot give you any special names, but if you assume that more or less all the big players in the German market place are also listed on our in our sales agreement, you may be absolutely right. And third is about location -- we fixed and substantiated our planning in that respect over the last three months. Now we know that's the start will be in Hamburg, Munich, and Frankfurt. We will have these three outlets not at one point in time but they will come subsequently and we'll get out to the market in plan, which means by the beginning of 2004. So, in summary, when it comes to the three-pillar strategy, all things are on schedule. Here I want to summarize and come to the outlook; we have to see that first half of the year, we saw shadows and lights when it comes to capital markets. First half was clearly not the best. The first quarter, second quarter went better. Comdirect is well prepared to deal with those changing environments; there is tough cost control; we have targeted investments; we have a very strategy and a clear agenda, and behind this clear agenda, there is a clear rolled out plan where we are on track. In the second quarter, especially, we profited from friendly markets, not only from friendly markets but also from the hard work on the cost side that we have been doing so far. So therefore, the very nice results that we have been seeing, especially in second quarter, that make us very confident and give us this strong belief that we will meet our target to pay dividend for the fiscal year 2003. I would like now to begin the question and answer session and we are very happy to share with you the views on the actual developments. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Operator Your question shall be answered in the order they are received. And if you are using speaker equipment today please lift the handset before making your selection. One moment please for the first question. First question comes from Mr. Alexander Plenck, please state your name and company name followed by your question. Alexander Plenck - BGB - Analyst Good morning, it's Alexander Plenck with BGB (ph) . First of all, congratulations on the numbers. Dr. Achim Kassow - Comdirect Bank AG - CEO Thanks a lot. Alexander Plenck - BGB - Analyst I would ask three questions please. My first one, could you give us an indication for July and early August concerning trading activity? Your colleagues in Munich told us that they would have seen increasing customer numbers from July, is that true for Comdirect as well? 7 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

AUGUST 12, 2003 / 9:00AM, CDBG.DE^K20 - Q2 2003 Comdirect Bank AG Earnings Conference Call My second question is on the UK, now that you have achieved the 40,000 customers that you told us you would need in order to breakeven, do you expect to get the business profitable in the second half of this year, and do you expect you can out balance loss of the first two quarters? And my third question is on NASDAQ revenues ph, would you expect that you have to write off your stake within the next two quarters? Thank you very much. Dr. Achim Kassow - Comdirect Bank AG - CEO Alexander, this is Achim speaking, just had short look with Andre and if you don't mind he will read through the following. I will try to get you an answer for the first question and the third one and Andre will comment on the UK business. Is that okay for you? Alexander Plenck - BGB - Analyst Yes. Dr. Achim Kassow - Comdirect Bank AG - CEO Okay, fine. And indication for July and beginning of August, when it comes to transaction activity and customer numbers -- I would put it that way. We haven't seen the overall temperature hindering our customers from trading. Alexander Plenck - BGB - Analyst Okay. Dr. Achim Kassow - Comdirect Bank AG - CEO Okay, that all right. When it comes to customer numbers and especially in comparison with our friends in Munich, there is only one fair ratio; I would give you on as a difference in business policy. You have seen that the customer numbers with the DAB is somewhat stable over the time; I think it's more stable than ours. On the other hand, if you have look at the number of trades executed 12 months ago and right now, you will see that the ratio, if you compare the trade executed at us and trade executed with DAB and that the ratio [Inaudible] 65%, so DAB made 65% of Comdirect trades. Now this ratio is below 50%, which means that we have seen some decrease in customer numbers but the overall quality of the customer portfolio clearly increased and this is what we see also in the beginning of the third quarter. And this is, say, somewhat to the first question, is that okay for you. Alexander Plenck - BGB - Analyst Lovely, thank you. Dr. Achim Kassow - Comdirect Bank AG - CEO Perfect, and now getting over to NASDAQ, I think your question was around the investment and the financial risk that might be associated to the NASDAQ, Germany and their future development. 8 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

AUGUST 12, 2003 / 9:00AM, CDBG.DE^K20 - Q2 2003 Comdirect Bank AG Earnings Conference Call I would like to answer on that because Andre is member of the Supervisory Board of NASDAQ, Deutschland. So, therefore he is somewhat conflicted in that respect as the overall investment of Comdirect AG in NASDAQ, Germany is around 860,000 euros and the book value as of 30th of June this year was one euro. Alexander Plenck - BGB - Analyst Okay. Dr. Achim Kassow - Comdirect Bank AG - CEO Is that okay? Alexander Plenck - BGB - Analyst Thanks a lot. Dr. Achim Kassow - Comdirect Bank AG - CEO Then we go for question number two, which is around UK and this will be Andre answering. Andre Carls - Comdirect Bank AG - CFO I am happy to do so. Well, yes, we see there is very nice development in the UK and also what we didn't speak about was that the cooperation with Lloyds, especially the cooperation regarding the [Inaudible] business is developing very nicely and amounts to more than 10% of the trades in the UK. Having set for that, we need to do still some work to breakeven and we stick to all our goals to have to breakeven in 2004 but I think, due to the vast development in UK, it is possible to say that we are already cash flow positive. Alexander Plenck - BGB - Analyst Meaning that within the next two quarters to come, we have to expect net losses for the UK. Andre Carls - Comdirect Bank AG - CFO That is true. As indicated at the begining of this year, we stick to our goal here but we stick also to the breakeven in 2004. Alexander Plenck - BGB - Analyst Thank you very much. Andre Carls - Comdirect Bank AG - CFO Welcome. 9 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

AUGUST 12, 2003 / 9:00AM, CDBG.DE^K20 - Q2 2003 Comdirect Bank AG Earnings Conference Call Operator Thank you sir. Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, please press star followed by one on your push-button phone at any time. As a reminder, if you are using speaker equipment, please lift your handset before making your selection. Next question comes from Mr. Thomas Rothausler. Please state your name, company name followed by your question, sir. Thomas Rothausler - Sal Oppenheim - Analyst Hi, this is Thomas Rothausler from Sal. Oppenheim. I just have one question on the financial advisors approach. You currently start and invest. Could you give us an update especially on the cost side and what you expect for the next two quarters in terms of investments and cost and P&L impact from this side? Dr. Achim Kassow - Comdirect Bank AG - CEO Yes, its Achim speaking. Thomas, I am happy to do that. The Financial Advisory business case, how we are introduced it to you and all the community? We stated that we would invest 5m euro in the year 2003, 2004, and 2005. Investment means cost dividend effecting directly bottom line of Comdirect group. So, for 2006, we expect breakeven for the new franchise. Now if it comes to the year 2003, I said the budget is 5m euro on the cost side to impact our P&L from that 5m, 1m has to be booked in the first half of this year. So, we will still wait for another 4m to come from the second half of this year. Is that okay for you? Thomas Rothausler - Sal Oppenheim - Analyst Okay. Can you give us the split roughly for the quarters? Dr. Achim Kassow - Comdirect Bank AG - CEO I have to admit that this is very much related to the question, when we start [Inaudible], and as this is not fixed at this point in time, we will be somewhat speculative. Thomas Rothausler - Sal Oppenheim - Analyst Okay. Maybe, a follow-up question on the cost side, can you give us an indication for the Comdirect group as a whole in respect of cost performance for the next two quarters? Can we assume like the same levels we have seen or do you see even further potential downwards? Dr. Achim Kassow - Comdirect Bank AG - CEO Well, yes, you heard me saying that we were especially proud keeping our cost base stable in spite of growing business, which means obviously a higher cost base as we face variable costs related to trading. 10 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

AUGUST 12, 2003 / 9:00AM, CDBG.DE^K20 - Q2 2003 Comdirect Bank AG Earnings Conference Call So, therefore from a globalized perspective, I stick with what Andre has said. We have the overall cost target of 120m euro for the whole fiscal year; we were at 56 by the end of 4th of June. If you keep in mind that I have said that the bulk of the investments with financial advisory is to come in the third and the fourth quarter. At this point in time I have no reason to revise the cost estimate downwards. Thomas Rothausler - Sal Oppenheim - Analyst Okay. Thanks a lot. Dr. Achim Kassow - Comdirect Bank AG - CEO Okay. Thanks. Operator [OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS] Excuse me Mr. Kassow; there are no further questions at this time. Dr. Achim Kassow - Comdirect Bank AG - CEO Well, this obviously might have been very convincing. All the guys that we have on the phone now want to go in the stock market and buy our stocks. We are very happy to see that and we are very happy to have you with us today. If there are any things to come out further on over the days or the days to come, we would be very happy to answer that in due course. Operator Thank you very much.

Earnings Conference Call When you look at our six months results, I think you should focus on a few numbers -- net revenues up 32 percent to $105 million -- that shows the economic growth of our company, taking out commodity price; EBITDA is up 28 percent to just under 60 million; funds from operations up 38 percent to 42 million; and net income of $16.5 million, up 35 percent. If you take out the gain that was in last year's numbers, net income is up 59 percent, and we did have a one time tax adjustment for future income tax, which someday I may understand, that impacted about $800,000 negatively in the second quarter. You see capital spending around $12 million, down slightly from last year. However, that does not include the investment in Taylor, and we were constructing the Joffre plant last year. And dividends have increased, as we announced, to 11 cents from our 8 cents. It's a strong quarter, it's as expected and we continue to deliver strong performance of 35 percent growth in earnings. When I look at the business and activity that we see things are busy. We had some 85 rigs drilling in our field gathering processing areas right now, an all-time record in our areas. We have seen some decline in production in the second quarter. Our June tied in about 30 wells and we saw increasing production there. July has been an extraordinary month for tie-ins, and I had one of our engineers e-mail that he just filled another plant and he only had one left to fill, "so get out there and buy me a big plant to fill." So, that's the type of activity level that we're seeing in the field gathering and processing side. On energy services side, the power business was strengthened in the second quarter. We're looking for another strong performance in the third quarter as well. So when we look at the business going forward it's just as expected, and as we said in the last quarter, and as we said in the annual report, Q1 strong; Q2 will be weaker compared to Q1 because of heating load, but all-time record -- we delivered an all-time record Q2 performance. We're expecting a stronger Q3 and a record performance in Q4. And we're on track for that business. Looking out to 2004, we're still expecting a good year there with strong power prices continuing. The other thing I'd like to talk about is acquisitions, which we're still working hard on acquisitions, but being very disciplined and conservative in our pricing. There's still a lot of opportunities, both small and large there. I think you'll see some interesting things that we're doing to structure some acquisitions that enhance value for the Company and you will see those coming over the remainder of this quarter. On a personal note, before my concluding remarks, I just want to let people know a couple of things that I will be doing and you will be seeing -- one, my traditional gift to the United Way, so you will see some shares being sold with respect to that donation, and that will probably happen in early September; as well as I'm moving my our RSPs into being professionally managed, and the professional manager, I expect, will have some comments on my diversification of risk profile and you may see some things happening there with respect to my asset mix and my RSP. So those things are happening on a personal basis, so you may see some minor share sales. Also, you'll see in an insider report that I just exercised 40,000 shares and held those in my account. In conclusion, very strong cash generation so far this year. We're well positioned for growth. Our debt is coming down. Our debt equity is improving. We have lots of financial capability and we're financially strong. Q3 will be a strong quarter for us, Q4 stronger and we expect this year to be consistent with our five-year growth. So that is my quick overview. I would be happy to open it up for questions on the operational side Gary will speak to and I will speak some general -- answer questions, as well as will Patricia.

Earnings Conference Call Fay Lee (ph), RBC Capital Markets. Fay Lee - RBC Capital Markets - Analyst David, I just was wondering on a couple of things, in terms of your income tax rate going forward I am just wondering if I have interpreted it correctly. Last year your rate was around 31, 32 percent. Should we expect the rate -- the effective rate to go up to about to 34 based on what you released in your press release? Or is it -- I'm also wondering about the impact of the lower federal tax rate next year. DAVID CORNHILL - Altagas Services Inc. - Chairman and CEO I think we had said that we thought, in the last conference call or the one before, 33 to 34. I think we look to between 34 and 35 now. A few things will be happening going forward. Large corporation tax being reduced that will reduce our rate. We expect to provincial governments to continue to meet their stated goals to reduce corporate rates, but they have not enacted, so that's still uncertain. And federal rates will continue to decline. Fay Lee - RBC Capital Markets - Analyst So 34, 35 is still a good rate to use going forward? DAVID CORNHILL - Altagas Services Inc. - Chairman and CEO Yes. Fay Lee - RBC Capital Markets - Analyst And the second thing is, I'm just wondering about your power price that you expect to receive over the first six months. It looks like it's been about $46. Is that sort of the range that we should expect going forward, say, for next year? DAVID CORNHILL - Altagas Services Inc. - Chairman and CEO I think that's a comfortable number and that's consistent where we're seeing the market in '04 right now. Operator Robert Catellier, Clarus Securities. Robert Catellier - Clarus Securities - Analyst Good morning. I was wondering if there's any change to your full-year CapEx outlook, given that the year-to-date number is down year-over-year compared with last year, notwithstanding the investment in Taylor? DAVID CORNHILL - Altagas Services Inc. - Chairman and CEO Not really. We see a number of construction projects, but we're being -- working hard to be very capital efficient and improve returns -- return on equity, return on capital. And acquisitions are, as you know, lumpy, and that can change very rapidly. 4 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Robert Catellier - Clarus Securities - Analyst The second question I had was with respect to the AEUB ruling and its impact on drilling activity in your areas. You did make some comments earlier which I interpret that -- it really hasn't impacted drilling strategies in any of your areas. Would you say that is a fair assessment? DAVID CORNHILL - Altagas Services Inc. - Chairman and CEO No, I think there has been some impact in the Winefred area clearly. And I think as well in the Thornbury this last winter you -- the uncertainty -- people weren't willing to drill. So those are winter only access. I think we saw less drilling activity. Other areas it hasn't impacted at all and we are seeing very significant drilling activity. The drilling activity we're seeing can be both gas and oil, but the activity level is up considerably. Robert Catellier - Clarus Securities - Analyst What would you estimate the capacity utilization rate would be, exiting the year, failing any type of acquisition in the gathering and processing -- field gathering and processing component? DAVID CORNHILL - Altagas Services Inc. - Chairman and CEO I would say up maybe one or two. That okay with you, Gary? GARY HOLDEN - Altagas Services Inc. - President and COO Yes, I think we can expect that the capacity utilization will creep up a little bit. Drilling activity that has occurred will start to produce in Q3 and Q4, and that should improve our numbers over Q2. Operator (CALLER INSTRUCTIONS) There are no further questions at this time. Please continue. MARILYN PFAEFFLIN - Altagas Services Inc. - Treasurer If there is no other questions, we can terminate the call. Thank you very much. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call for today. Thank you for participating.

CORPORATE PARTICIPANTS Eileen Dunn Office Depot - Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations Bruce Nelson Office Depot - Chairman and CEO PRESENTATION Operator Welcome to Office Depot's mid-quarter business update. I would like to introduce Eileen Dunn, Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations. Eileen Dunn - Office Depot - Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our mid-quarter update for the third quarter ending September 27, 2003. Before Bruce begins his comments, let me remind you that except for historical information, the matters discussed in this taped message are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Forward-looking statements, including projections and anticipated levels of future performance, involve risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed herein. These risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time by Office Depot in our filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, including, without limitation, are 10-K and 10-Qs. You're strongly urged to review all such filings for a more detailed discussion of such risks and uncertainties. Now let me turn today's call over to Bruce Nelson, Office Depot's Chairman and CEO. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman and CEO Thanks, Eileen, and good day to all of you. First, a brief summary of where we stand so far in the quarter. North American retail sales continue to show sequential quarterly improvements in spite of significantly declining sales and technology reflecting average selling price declines in some of our key hardware categories, even though unit sales are up. Back to school sales are up over last year. Both North American BSG sales and total international sales in local currencies are tracking in line with our expectations. However, the recent strengthening of the dollar versus the euro and pound is putting some pressure on our European operating profit. Based on currency exchange rate trends, we now expect a couple of pennies in downside risk to EPS in the third-quarter. Our recent acquisition of Guilbert is proceeding as planned and is achieving our forecasted synergies. Quarter-to-date comparable North American Retail sales are showing sequential improvements over the second quarter. Back-to-school sales are up over last year with strong unit growth in many key categories in a highly competitive back-to-school season. Quarter-to-date traffic and transaction counts are also up over last year, showing their strongest results so far this year. Quarter-to-date on a total category basis, core office supplies are comping positive with particular strength in ink, toner and paper. Our retail furniture initiatives are beginning to show signs of improving sales trends in this category. However, as I said, declining sales in virtually all of our computer hardware categories is currently offsetting these positive quarter-to-date sales trends in the rest of our business. This weakness in technology sales is primarily attributable to declining average selling prices, not volume. For example, quarter-to-date comparable sales of all-in-one machines are down over 15 percent in dollar volume, while comparable unit sales in these categories are up over 20 percent. As expected, the highly competitive back-to-school market, as well as our planned clearance activities, are putting some pressure on gross margins. Our overall retail gross margins are expected to be in the range of 100 basis points below last year, which is in line with our previous expectations. Trending positive comps in core office supply categories remain very encouraging, but as I said, are being somewhat offset by declining sales in technology. So, we now expect third-quarter North American retail comps to be slightly negative to neutral versus our previous expectation for slightly positive comps, virtually all attributable to declines in technology. 2 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

SEPTEMBER 03, 2003 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Office Depot to Broadcast Pre-Taped Mid-Quarter Business Update Conference Call Moving on to our North American BSG segment, our contract and e-commerce businesses continue to show sales improvement over second-quarter levels, although our North American catalog business remains soft, in line with expectations. For the quarter, BSG sales growth is trending around the low-single-digit range. Sales in the large customer segment continue to outpace sales growth in our small and medium-sized accounts. Our worldwide e-commerce sales remain on track to achieve 2.5 billion sales forecasts for the full year. Gross margins in the quarter are tracking on plan, and we continue to see improvements in productivity and efficiency that should continue to drive down our cost structure on a year-over-year basis, again consistent with our plan, and consistent with what we have been able to do the past few years. From the international segment perspective, sales in local currencies are holding steady at planned levels. They have improved sequentially over the second quarter, although Germany and France continue to suffer from weaker economic conditions. As I said earlier, currency rates have moved unfavorably over the past two months and have dropped well below our expectations for the period. In fact, during the quarter so far, the euro has dropped dramatically from a high of $1.16 to the current $1.09 level against the dollar. With the Guilbert acquisition, almost 25 percent of our total sales are now outside of North America and fluctuations in the euro and pound will have a larger impact on our reported results. As I said, if currency rates remain at current levels, or the euro and pound should decline further against the dollar, we now see a downside foreign exchange risk to consolidated third-quarter consensus earnings of a couple of pennies per share. Our integration of Guilbert remains on track to achieve the synergies and accretion we have previously outlined. This highly strategic acquisition virtually doubled our size in Europe and is complementary to our existing large, profitable European business. While we are managing through the current economic and currency challenges, we remained highly optimistic about our ability to generate strong earnings when we begin to see a pickup in overall business spending and employment levels. We remain relentlessly focused on finding new and innovative ways to grow our business. We now expect 20 to 25 Millennium Remodels to be completed or in progress by the end of the fourth quarter, and we remain highly encouraged by the results in our first new Millennium store in the Atlanta market. As I said before, we plan to make significant changes in North America retail technologies, planograms and product offerings in the fourth quarter that we believe will improve our selling results in this important category. Yesterday, we announced a new store-within-a-store concept with Albertson's, which will give us additional access to convenience traffic, as well as a better understanding of the convenience market as a whole. We see this as another attractive opportunity for us to partner with successful retailers, servicing their customers with Office Depot products and further strengthening our overall brand position. We have many focused initiatives under way in North American Retail, and we remain confident and encouraged by their early results. We are gaining share in the large customer segments in North American deliveries, and as I have said before, we are even more confident that our acquisition of Guilbert will generate substantial shareholder value. Thanks for taking the time to listen and have a great day.

OCTOBER 24, 2003 / 6:00PM, - Q3 2003 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Let me set the stage for today's call with a few comments about the Hawaiian economy. First, the overarching comment is that we have a steadily-improving picture in Hawaii. 2004 tourist estimates are indicating that about 6 percent more tourist will be here in '04 compared to '03. That certainly is encouraging. The yen, at about 110 to the dollar, is favorable to increased Japanese tourist spending. I did attend a high level Japan/Hawaii economic meeting about a week ago. And certainly there is increased optimism about Japan's prospects, and as a result, the prospects for Japanese travel and spending in Hawaii. Residential construction and sales are robust in Hawaii, and have been for the last 15 to 18 months. That is similar to the mainland. Commercial real estate conditions are improving in Hawaii. That is a little bit unlike the mainland, where, for the most part, our markets are pretty stable. One other factor worthy of comment today is that there is a major privatization of military housing rehabilitation underway in Hawaii, and that will be a boon for this economy for a number of years in the future. Let me just review, very briefly, the segment information for the third-quarter performance. I will first go to food products. If you could turn to page 5 of the earnings release -- food products did have a tough quarter. We have been direct in stating that this part of the company, which represents about 10 percent of our assets, was not going to perform as well in 2003 as it did in 2002. We were facing -- and we realized we were facing -- a year-to-year increase in 2003 of about $4 million in pension expense. So you will see about three quarters of that through the first 9 months of the year. We had planned for that. In addition, we are expecting our production for the year at HC&S (ph), our sugar plantation on Maui, to be about 6,000 tons below our original estimate of 215,000 tons. That will impact, for the year, operating income by about $2 million. As we go forward, and look at 2004, in the sugar business, futures (ph) prices are down -- somewhere between three-quarters to 1 cent per pound. That will have, certainly, some effect as we begin to plan for the year 2004 in this business. So, it will be a challenge as we go ahead in our food products business. Let me turn to Matson next, on page 2 of the earnings release -- a very good quarter. Operating profit increased from 16.9 million in 2002 to 25.1 million for the third quarter of 2003. Seasonally, the third quarter is usually the best quarter of the year, but it was excellent performance, anyway. This is a business with fairly-high operating leverage. Smaller changes in rates and volume can have a larger effect on the bottom line. The company is in a favorable environment -- rates are up; volume is up, as you can note in the report; and our freight mix has also improved. So, all those factors are moving in the right direction. Matson had an unusual surge of autos in the first half of the year, as we previously noted. And on a timing basis, in the third quarter, the autos were down a bit from the prior year. The 4 percent container growth that Matson has achieve so far this year, we view positively. That is a good absolute growth rate. There are two offsets to otherwise-very-good performance at Matson from a P&L standpoint. First, is that pension expenses are up, on a full-year basis, $10 million 2003, compared to 2002. So you see about three-quarters of that 10 million in the year-to-date performance. And Sand Island, which is continuing to show improvement over prior year, did not improve over the second quarter of this year. Transportation business -- I would just make one or two more comments. Fuel cost are an important component of the business. We do have a fuel surcharge in place to offset cost increases. The fuel surcharge was raised in September from 6.5 to 7.5 percent. I'm going to ask Jim Andrasick, in his remarks, to comment on our new ship, the Manukai, which entered the Hawaii service at the end of the third quarter -- the vessel cost $105 million. It's the first of two new ships to be completed and it is the first new ship in the fleet since 1992. And Jim will have a little bit more to say about that. On the real estate segment, there is really nothing remarkable here. As we go to page 3 -- the leasing part of the business was up 6 percent, and operating profits from 8.6 to $9.1 million. The Hawaii is strengthening; the mainland market is stable, as previously indicated. There is really nothing remarkable. If you go to page 4 on the property development and management segment of real estate -- we are tracking well against our plans for the year. In the third quarter, we did use the proceeds from previous sales of property to reinvest in 3 new properties. One is the Broadlands Shopping Center in Broomfield, Colorado, just north of Denver. That is a neighborhood shopping center -- 95,000 square feet; consideration was 3 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Centennial Plaza was acquired -- that is a warehouse complex in Salt Lake City -- for $8 million. That is a 244,000-square-foot series of three industrial buildings. And, third, lastly, the P&L Plaza on Maui -- a 45,000-square-foot neighborhood shopping center -- was acquired for $7 million. This is part of our ongoing program of sale and purchase of commercial properties. I will discuss the elements of our development activity, which is pretty exciting, in a few minutes, as it relates to things that we expect to occur over the next several years. I would like to just, for a moment, move and make some remarks about the fourth quarter of this year. As you know, as a matter of policy, we do not give specific guidance on earnings. Having said this, we can look at parts of our business and point to some reasonable directional conclusions. In ocean transportation, we did have very good improvement in the third quarter, and are going to enjoy a good fourth quarter in the absence of the effects of the labor disruption that took place in the fourth quarter of last year. But, there is also seasonality in this business, and you have to take into account. Historically, the first quarter has usually been the smallest-profit quarter. The fourth quarter, the second smallest. The second quarter is usually our second-best, and the third quarter is usually the best quarter of the year. In property leasing, we would expect a fairly-normal continuation of incremental growth. In property sales, as we previously indicated, the largest transaction that we had planned for the year have already closed. Sales for the rest of the year will be mostly smaller ones. In food products, the fourth quarter is expected to be modestly profitable, compared to the unusually-high profits in the fourth quarter of 2002. Taking all of these factors together, we expect that the composition of our earnings in the fourth quarter will be quite different than a year ago. But, in aggregate, the results will look something like the fourth quarter of 2002. Let me now turn, just for a few minutes, to our real estate development activity, which really is not showing up yet on the income statement, but is beginning to show on the balance sheet. I am going to do this really, really quickly. So, I apologize in advance. I'm going to talk about five projects -- Wailea, Hokua, Lanikea, Alakea, and Kukuiula -- there's a lot of Hawaiian there. But, in aggregate, these five investments represent, initially, about $200 million capital investment for the company. Wailea, first, is a $67 million investment. This started out at $135.5 million when we put our first press release, indicating that we were going to buy it. The investment ended up being 131.5 million, so there was a small reduction in purchase price. Of that, we were successful in selling off the Wailea golf courses and some Kauai golf courses and land in a back-to-back transaction. As a result, our net investment in Wailea is $67 million, or 270 acres of fully-zoned residential -- primarily residential -- land at Wailea. That is about $250,000 in acres. It's 270 acres --consist of 17, both development parcels, most of which have excellent ocean or golf course views. None of them are on the beach, but they is some very good view land. The purchase also included 29 single-family lots in an existing subdivision. And, we are going to begin marketing those in the next week or so. The 17 parcels are going to be developed over a period 8 to 10 years, with a total buildout of at least 1,300 units. We are going to engage in a program of selling some of the lots to other developers, developing some ourselves or in joint ventures with others. We expect and plan to undertake the development of sale of two to three of these parcels a year. We think the prospects are excellent, and we are comfortable and confident that this investment is going to be a good earner from the beginning. And, that means in the year 2004. The second project is Hokua -- we have talked about that before -- it's a $40 million investment. There are 247 luxury high-rise units; and a very beautiful tower to be built -- 232 of these have been pre-sold on a non-binding basis for more than $1 million a unit. Construction on the project will begin by the end of this year. The buildout could take 24 months, meaning that we should achieve income -- beginning to achieve income on this investment in the fourth quarter of 2005 or in the first quarter of 2006. The third project is Lanikea -- that is a 43 to $45 million dollar investment. There are 100 units -- we put 97 of them out for sale. 97 of the 97 -- that means all of them -- are sold on a non-binding basis -- $560,000 per unit. We are in the process, as we speak, of converting these to binding contracts. Construction is going to start next month. We expect the first sales to occur sometime between the first and the second quarter of 2005. 4 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

OCTOBER 24, 2003 / 6:00PM, - Q3 2003 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call The fourth project is Alakea -- that is an office building in downtown Honolulu -- thirty-one floors, Class A. We bought it for $20 million, $105 per square foot. We are doing something that is extraordinary Hawaii -- I guess it's extraordinary for anywhere. We're condominium-izing it, basically selling fee simple interest in the office. A lot of people did not think we could do this. We are in the initial sales effort right now, and the response has been really good. We will report more on this in the next quarterly report that we made make to you -- we will see a tiny bit of income in 2003, and more in 2004. But, remember, this is only a $20 million investment. So, it will not show up as a huge amount on other income line, but it's going to be a very good earner for us. The last project -- and I'll be very, very brief on this -- is our Kukuiula joint venture with DMB Associates. We have negotiated in our joint venture a return from the land that we've contributed to the joint venture. The nominal book value of that land is $30 million. It's likely, at this point in time, that we will co-investment with DMB in the development of the thousand-acre project. We expect to finish up some very significant re-entitlement activity in the next year, and would think that either in late 2005 or in the year 2006 that we would begin to achieve income on this project. So, there is a lot going on in the real estate area. And, we are just starting to put it on our balance sheet. With the $67 million for Wailea, the $20 million for Alakea, the transfer of the Kukuiula land interest for 30 million, and the other projects that have been noted. With that, I'm going to turn it over to you, Jim. Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - Executive Vice President & CFO Thank you very much, Allen. To add to that level of activity, we would just like to briefly comment on the two major third-quarter events at Matson. The first, of course, was the delivery and acceptance of the first of two ships being built at Kimerna (ph) Philadelphia Shipyard. We did accept delivery in September. The vessel will be in a warranty period for about a year, but I can say now that the initial performance has been excellent. We have entered it into our Hawaii service, and it has now made 2 complete voyage turns, and as I said, performance is good. It was delivered well within our overall budget of 105 million. That includes owner spares and inspection costs of the owner's (indiscernible), as well as the contract cost. The financing was fulfilled by taking about 42 million out of our capital construction fund, and supplementing that with 55 million in Title 11 government guaranteed bond financing under the (indiscernible) Title 11 program. This new vessel, we feel now, will not be dilutive to A&B's earnings, based on a really expected fuel and food (ph) cost savings, as well as our actual financing costs. And the depreciation on the ships will be about $3 million, incremental per year, or 800,000 per quarter. The second vessel, the Mauna Willie (ph), is well underway. Our expectation now is that delivery will occur sometime early during the second half of 2004. The other major event at Matson was -- and I believe we have commented on this before -- has been our vehicle handling strategy. The company has adopted a program to increase our capacity to handle more cars in the Hawaii service on a -- what's called a roll on/roll off basis. Right now, our ability to handle cars in that way is about 25 percent of total capacity. And, our objective is to give that up to 75 percent. And, two important steps were taken during the quarter to achieve that -- First, roll (ph) vessel, the Greatland (ph), was chartered in for a period of -- a minimum of two years, with a series of one-year options thereafter to move cars. It was placed in service on October second, and the results, so far, have been very positive. The company has also, as a part of this, secured the use of separate (indiscernible) facilities in both Oakland and Honolulu to load and discharge cars. We are also expanding the garage capacity on one of our current fleet units, the (indiscernible), which will be placed back into service after its modifications in December of this year. And we have reintroduced, as a part of this activity, a direct roll/roll (ph) service to Maui, which is a large destination for us in automobiles. All these changes really are service-related, not really designed as cost-saving measures. It is industry standard -- international industry standard -- to move vehicles this way, and we are taking those important steps, which have begun in the month of September. 5 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

OCTOBER 24, 2003 / 6:00PM, - Q3 2003 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Now, I would like to just make some brief comments about the financial performance of the company. The industry segment data, which Allen has already covered for the principal businesses, is on page 8. I would just comment that revenues were very strong during the third quarter, up 8 percent, up 12 percent for the 9 months. (indiscernible) earnings were up significantly on a consolidated basis. Interest expense for the company was about flat during the quarter, and actually down by a million dollars for the first 9 months. And all of that was really rate-driven. Corporate expenses were lower by 1,300,00 during the quarter, in up slightly from the prior year. And we had a onetime impact of insurance proceeds and some adjustments to incentive plan accruals during the third quarter, which gave us that positive comparison. Income taxes were -- the effective rate was moved from 37 percent to 36.5 percent in the third quarter. That reflects our best estimate of our tax position for the year 2003. So, good P&L performance, and also, I should note that there were no sales of ongoing operations in the real estate properties group during the quarter, so there's zero affect for that particular sales account. If I can just turn briefly make a couple of comments on our balance sheet, which is included -- it's page 9 in the earnings statement. Really, all the impacts in the quarter and (indiscernible) dominating the first 9 months were the results of two major transactions. The first was the vessel financing and acceptance, and the second was the Wailea transaction. If I can just turn your attention to the property net account, it was up $120 million since the end of last year, and 100 million of that was the new vessel purchase. The capital construction fund was actually a source -- partial source, as I've already noted -- for that. So its balances have gone down by about 38 million since the end of last year. The Wailea transaction was in escrow at the end of the quarter. Of course, it has subsequently closed, is Allen has noted. And, in other assets, 77 million of that increase is related to the funds that have been placed to support that transaction. On the liability side, it has been noted that our long-term debt has increased significantly -- 118 million -- up to 365 million. That is a 33 percent debt-to-total-cap ration. We still feel that is prudent, given the mix of investment activity in which we are involved. And the composition of that debt has changed somewhat -- we have taken advantage of what we considered to be a favorable rate environment, and fixed additional debt. Of course, the vessel financing is fixed 25-year money -- $55 million, an overall (indiscernible) rate of about -- a little over 6 percent. We have also fixed additional money, with an average life of 6 years, at 4.1 percent. That was about $50 million. And we have retired about 15 million of special purchase revenue bonds at Matson. And that shows in other long-term liabilities, and indicates a decrease in those accounts, which should save Matson about $300,000 a year, going forward in its interest cost. If I can just include my financial remarks -- a comment on page 9 -- the cash flow -- excuse me, page 10, the cash flow statement. And clearly, with better operating results, two of our major segments -- the operating cash flows -- are well-above last year's first 9 months -- 115 million. And the last year, you may recall, we had some very significant tax payments, which somewhat depressed those operating cash flows, so the comparison is even better this year. Capital expenditures totaled 130 million, as I said earlier, and most of that is the new vessels. CCF was -- compared to 52 million of contributions made to the CCF last year, this year we withdrew 38 million and it's for the vessel financing. So, it was a very good quarter for -- and 9 months -- for cash flow. With that, I would like to turn this back to John Kelley, who will talk more about the Hawaii economy and some recent trends. John Kelley - Alexander & Baldwin - Vice President of Investor Relations Thanks, Jim. I think in the interest of time, I'm going to eliminate some of the statistics I normally provide you with. If you need numbers on visitor statistics or construction activities -- some of the things I will allude -- let's talk separately. As Allen indicated, the economy continues to perform very well, based primarily on high levels of real estate sales, both on the neighbor islands and here on Oahu -- both in the sales of existing homes and in the sales of newly-built homes. And that, in turn, is driving construction activity. These activities, plus good growth among visitors from the U.S., are more than offsetting the still lower-than-prior-year travel activity from visitors from Japan. 6 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

OCTOBER 24, 2003 / 6:00PM, - Q3 2003 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Recently, the state raised its forecast for real gross state product for this present year, for the second time this year -- it is now 2.6 percent real. Plus, prospects are improving for sustained moderate growth for the state, both with the accelerated visitor growth that Allen mentioned, plus projects that are in the pipeline, especially three very substantial ones to replace and upgrade military housing, via a process of privatization of the military housing. And, there are a number of other wild cards -- I would call them -- among the growth prospects, including, in particular, the yen at 110 to the dollar versus (technical difficulty) a month or so ago -- I think 118, which enhances Japanese spending power, of course, here in the state. Plus, active prospects (indiscernible) investigated for basing an aircraft carrier at Pearl Harbor. And also, the very real plans to increase the number of cruise vessels based in Hawaii from one at the moment to three in the near future. Again, on statistics, on visitors and construction activity, I would be glad to talk to people separately. But, in the interest of time, I think I will end the economic comments right here. So, operator, we are ready to open for questions and answers, if you will. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Operator (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). Jamelah Leddy, McAdams Wright Ragen. Jamelah Leddy - McAdams Wright Ragen - Analyst My first question has to do with Sand Island, and I know that you said -- I think, sequentially, you did not see any improvements in Sand Island. I'm wondering if you can maybe quantify that a little bit in terms of maybe container moves per hour? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President & CEO Sure, Jim, would you respond to that question on Sand Island? Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - Executive Vice President & CFO Certainly. As we reported earlier, we made steady progress during the past 6 quarters in correcting some of the startup problems with the new technology and the new processes and procedures there. The third quarter was a bit of a setback for us. I would call it -- not so much in a quantitative way, because the moves-per-hour metric that we have quoted was down only slightly. But rather, it stopped what had been steady progress that we were expecting and demanding. I would, first of all, be quick to say that anything over 20 moves-per-hour will satisfy -- at Sand Island -- will satisfy all customer requirements. But, we have not had any diminution in service as far as the customers can see. But anything over, really, results in productivity gains, which were a part of the original capital expenditure that exceeded $30 million in that facility. So, you know, we have dropped back a little bit from the second quarter -- maybe one and a half moves, one move per hour. But, I cannot really quantify that for you in dollar terms. Serve it to say we have not -- we have to renew those efforts there to continue what had been some very positive work practice moves and efficiency moves there. And, as I said, the customer has not suffered as a result. Jamelah Leddy - McAdams Wright Ragen - Analyst All right. Was there any issue that you can talk about? One issues? Or was it just like a lot of little things? 7 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

OCTOBER 24, 2003 / 6:00PM, - Q3 2003 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - Executive Vice President & CFO A lot of little things. Jamelah Leddy - McAdams Wright Ragen - Analyst As you mentioned, you have made substantial improvements over the last year-and-a-half. Do you think there still are quite a bit more improvements to be made? Or have you really sort of achieved the bulk of the efficiencies you expected to get out of that facility? Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - Executive Vice President & CFO We've, I think, flushed out all of the major issues. Now, contributing to the complexity of new terminals, when you have a new vessel -- (indiscernible) -- in this case, two new vessels, one chartered and one owned -- They (indiscernible) differently, and there is some learning curve. So, the fourth quarter presents challenges as well. But, I think it is a lot of small things. And it is not going to be a 20 percent improvement. We're looking to get our golf (ph) score down maybe two or three strokes here to achieve our ultimate objectives. Jamelah Leddy - McAdams Wright Ragen - Analyst Okay. Great. With respect to the new car vessel -- obviously that frees up more capacity for containers. I'm wondering, I guess, a couple of things. One is -- with the improvement in the Hawaiian economy and the construction, do you see a lot of demand for that capacity? And secondly, if you could comment at all on any potential competition from other auto carriers? Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - Executive Vice President & CFO Certainly. The chartered (indiscernible) vessel actually replaced one of our container liner vessels, which is now on standby service. So, there was no net increase in container capacity. This roll/roll vessel actually does carry, by our design, 100 containers on (indiscernible). So, we are about neutral on that side of it. But, the vehicle capacity certainly has increased as a result of these actions. In respect to competitive activity, we know, really, nothing more than we knew at the last earnings call about Facia (ph) and its intent or indication that they will enter the Hawaii trade at the end of next year, or perhaps in 2005 with their own pier car carrier. Jamelah Leddy - McAdams Wright Ragen - Analyst Okay. Great. I will get back in queue. Thank you. Operator Nicholas Aberle, Caris & Company. Nicholas Aberle - Caris & Company - Analyst Congratulations on the good quarter. The first question is with respect to margins at Matson. The margin improvement was pretty impressive -- a little over 13 percent for the ocean transportation unit. It improved sequentially from another previous-strong number -- a little over 11 percent. What was the main differences between Q2 and Q3 if there was not increased efficiency at Sand Island? 8 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

OCTOBER 24, 2003 / 6:00PM, - Q3 2003 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - Executive Vice President & CFO Principally volume on containers. I think that was the main driver. And as we go (inaudible) here, we're going to see contractual increases in costs (technical difficulty) under the terms of our new six-year agreement. (technical difficulty) And as, I believe Allen has said, this is a volume-sensitive business -- very high fixed costs. So any improvement in volumes helps. We have also -- in our Guam service -- have enjoyed higher volumes as a result of the rebuilding that is going on in Guam after last year's devastating tycoons. We do not expect that to repeat next year. (technical difficulty) The results of our affiliates also have improved, year-over-year, and actually, quarter-over-quarter. So those include our investments (inaudible) -- V-Star and the Puerto Rico trade, as well as our joint venture with SSA in our West Coast terminals. Nicholas Aberle - Caris & Company - Analyst Okay. So, the margins seem to, like, stabilize a little bit above the 10 percent mark. And, obviously, a lot better than the end of last year. Is this scope for further improvement? Or is this the top-of-the-line 13 percent operating profit margin for the ocean transportation business? Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - Executive Vice President & CFO Yeah, I think that 13 -- I think it is 13.2 or 13.3 (multiple speakers) -- that is kind of top-of-the-line. Also, as noted earlier, the third quarter is really a kind of a seasonal high. So, to the extent to which you are getting a little bit more traffic -- and its actually even better, better freights -- you expect your margins to be higher than they probably would on a normalized basis, where you might expect the margins to be 10, 11 percent or more(technical difficulty) (inaudible) Nicholas Aberle - Caris & Company - Analyst Perfect. With respect to cash flow, it looks like you generated about 53, $54 million in operating cash flow in the quarter. Free cash flow probably would have been positive if the CapEx number had not been so high. Is that the type of cash flow generation that we can expect to see on a quarterly basis, going forward? And, does this strong cash flow affect your dividend policies, going forward? Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - Executive Vice President & CFO This is Jim. I will take the first part of that. And I will let Allen take the dividend issue part. I think the cash flows are driven -- at Matson, they are certainly more consistent, but with major capital projects that we have -- which is vessel purchases -- in any one quarter, it is going to be a great distortion of that. But, peeling that off, I think Matson's cash flow is fairly regular throughout the year. The wild card, always, for A&B is where we set with our property development and sales -- resales. We have all these projects that Allen mentioned. We have it in inventory that is constantly changing of real estate units, whether they be raw land or subdivided parcels or buildout parcels. It is very hard to time those. And, I think that the variability in cash flow from real estate is high. And, I hesitate to even try to predict it, month by month. Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President & CEO On the second question of dividends -- certainly, the environment for dividend payments is a better one. And, it is better in several ways. The first is the obvious -- a change in the tax treatment of dividends. Hawaii's improving economy and the company's good operating results, I think, are also factors that are favorable. We have been, and we continue to, review our dividend policy. 9 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

OCTOBER 24, 2003 / 6:00PM, - Q3 2003 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call We are cautious. This is a board decision, and, strictly a board decision. But, when you think about changing or increasing your dividends, you have to be very cautious because it is a permanent change. And, the company has had a very solid and a consistent record in the payment of dividends. And, so we need to take care in the analysis that we do, that we take all these factors into consideration. With the environment -- it is certainly improving for dividends. Nicholas Aberle - Caris & Company - Analyst Okay, perfect. Just one last quick question with respect to the Wailea resort transaction. You said that a good amount of the property had good views of the ocean and golf courses. Is there any kind of breakdown you can give us with what percent have those kind of amenities? And a breakdown of what percent is owned as single-family, multifamily, etc.? Unidentified Speaker I don't have -- it is principally multifamily. There is a fair amount of single families, but it is principally multifamily, with a little bit of commercial. I cannot give you the exact unit count, but it is pretty high multi. But, that is sort of the norm at Wailea. What I can say, and I can give you this in a very real way, because I just spent a day walking up and down -- (laughter) -- every piece and part of the property the week before last. It has excellent views. And, really, the value of the land has a lot to do with not only where it's located, in terms of being part of Wailea, which is a very, very successful long-term development, but it also depends on what people see when they wake up in the morning. And, the graduating nature of the views there, I think, makes this an unusually-valuable and attractive property. And, the percentage of those views is pretty high as a component of the overall acreage. Nicholas Aberle - Caris & Company - Analyst Okay, perfect. As I understand, 270 acres, fully entitled and zoned at this point. You had mentioned that you guys had already began to market some of the single-family lots that you had. Is there a possibility that we could see this being accretive to earnings in 2004? And maybe even as possibly as early as Q4? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President & CEO Q4 of '03? Nicholas Aberle - Caris & Company - Analyst Yes. Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President & CEO No. But in 2004, we do expect -- yeah, we do expect to achieve income. And I think when this was announced at the last call, I did indicate that we expected this not to be dilutive. It's not 137 million or 35 million -- it's 67 million. And I think we are also going to -- we expect to get out of the blocks pretty well on this project. So, the prospects for 2004 are good for income. Nicholas Aberle - Caris & Company - Analyst All right. Thank you very much, guys. 10 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

OCTOBER 24, 2003 / 6:00PM, - Q3 2003 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Operator Tom Spiro (ph), Spiro Capital Management. Tom Spiro - Spiro Capital Management - Analyst First, on the subject of Matson -- could you review with us, please, the significant auto contracts that you have? And when they expire? Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - Executive Vice President & CFO That is, I guess, company-privileged information; I really cannot comment on that, Tom. Serve it to say that we do business with all of the major manufacturers, and have contracts that vary in length and term. Tom Spiro - Spiro Capital Management - Analyst Do any expire in '04? Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - Executive Vice President & CFO I cannot comment on that. Tom Spiro - Spiro Capital Management - Analyst Okay. On the property side, Allen, I think mentioned in your commentary that the commercial real estate market in Hawaii -- I think you said is beginning to improve. Can you just give us a little bit of a flavor for how rates seem to be trending? And also vacancies for commercial properties? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President & CEO Yes, I can do this very briefly. First, the industrial people say there is a 2 percent vacancy rate, but you cannot find it. Basically, it is the lowest vacancy rate of any market in the United States -- it is essentially, zero. Rates are moving up fairly significantly on industrial space, especially in Oahu. But, just about everywhere. The office market of the three major components of commercial is kind of sideways. Rates -- vacancy is about 14 to 15 percent. That has not changed that materially in the last year or two. There is an expectation that the vacancy rate will go down, but right now, it is pretty high. Rates are stable there; they are neither going up materially or going down. In terms of the retail market, there is some slight upward pressure on rates. It is a little harder to get a grasp of what vacancy is there. But, it is generally in the -- probably vacancy is 5 to 7 percent. Essentially, what you have is any -- the only place -- the only vacant, really good real estate -- the real estate space that is vacant is usually the less-desirable locations. So I think the retail market is pretty robust, too. Tom Spiro - Spiro Capital Management - Analyst Okay. Thank you. 11 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

OCTOBER 24, 2003 / 6:00PM, - Q3 2003 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Operator (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). Dan Moore (ph), Stevens. Dan Moore - Stevens - Analyst Excellent quarter. I just wanted to asked one or two quick question. With regard to the change in name at Matson Intermodal to I guess, Matson Integrated Logistics. Should we interpret that in any way, shape, manner, or form to be a strategic development? And, could you on what your longer-term aspirations for that business are? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President & CEO Yes. I think that it is certainly a signal of that (ph) strategic emphasis. And, Jim, would you comment more on that? Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - Executive Vice President & CFO Yes. As you know, since we started breaking the results out last year for this segment, you can now see the progress that is being made on the volume side. We have added geographic coverage, headcount to go with it. And the earnings improvement. Although it is a small part of Matson, it is certainly growing the most rapidly. So, our expectations are high. This is a very fragmented industry. As I know you know, Dan, and there are a lot of opportunities to gain additional coverage, either through acquisition of agencies or people or businesses. For now, I would leave it at that. But clearly, we are putting more of our attention to this, and expect a fairly rapid growth in this segment. Dan Moore - Stevens - Analyst Great. And I may have missed this. If I have, I apologize. CapEx guidance for the full year '03, excluding any unforeseen purchase announcements? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President & CEO For the 9 months, as we talked about for -- what hit our capital accounts -- was 190 -- or 130, rather. Dan Moore - Stevens - Analyst Sure. Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President & CEO If you grossed that up for our reinvestment activity in 10/31 properties and other real estate developments that are held for sale, gross spending for the 9 months was about 206 million. And, our expectation for the balance of the year will be -- we will add Wailea at 67 million, which is a done deal, as we said. And other normal capital, which is hard to time, but our investments in Hokua, and several other property ventures, will certainly increase that, as well as normal spending for the fourth quarter at Matson and in our food products group. So, we would expect that number to be in excess of $300 million for the full year, on a gross basis. Dan Moore - Stevens - Analyst Thanks, again, guys for (indiscernible). 12 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

OCTOBER 24, 2003 / 6:00PM, - Q3 2003 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Operator Tom Spiro, Spiro Capital Management. Tom Spiro - Spiro Capital Management - Analyst Could you update us on the status of the Hawaiian tax dispute? Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - Executive Vice President & CFO Certainly. Our 10-Q will be issued shortly. I don't have a -- it is similar disclosure to the last quarter relating to this matter. Talks are continuing with the State Department of taxation on this matter. And, as a result of those discussions, we have made the statement, once again, that we feel that resolution of this issue will not have a material adverse effect on either operations or financial condition. Like most tax disputes with authorities, they take much longer to resolve that you think. And this one is no exception. I believe there is -- certainly a mutual intent to try to resolve this before the end of the calendar year, but I am not certain that can be accomplished either. So, small, but slow, progress -- is the way I would describe it. Tom Spiro - Spiro Capital Management - Analyst Separate question -- the company has a number of sort of small investments in different enterprises -- there's CNH, there's the operation down in Puerto Rico, there are one or two others, as I recall. In the aggregate, is there anything there of particular node in the quarter? Or is it pretty much status quo? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President & CEO I would say that there's nothing of particular note, other than the comment that Jim made previously that performance of our (indiscernible) Star investment in Puerto Rico has improved this year versus last. Tom Spiro - Spiro Capital Management - Analyst Thanks, much, and good luck. Operator If there are no further questions, I will turn the conference back to Mr. Kelley for any final remarks. John Kelley - Alexander & Baldwin - Vice President of Investor Relations Thank you very much for your participation. Aloha. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference for today. Thank you all for your participation and have a nice day. All parties may now disconnect. 13 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Good morning, Eileen. Thanks for all of you for joining us here this morning. I'm (indiscernible) from beautiful downtown Delray Beach, where it is middle October and our weather starts to turn very nice. For those that live here, we enjoy it a lot. Before I start with the numbers, I want to take a minute here to reflect. Like many of you, I've had an opportunity over the past few days to read all of the sales-side reports on the condition of Office Depot. I'm delighted to report this morning that we (indiscernible) open for business around the world, that when I looked at numbers this morning, I was pretty encouraged by what I saw around the world -- that in the room with me this morning our nine of some of our best leaders in the Company that I'm enormously proud of -- that most of the offices that I walked by this morning are fully occupied with qualified and leadership (sic), and there's a couple of empty ones we're trying to fill. It reminds me, I think, of a quote a long time ago about reports of a death in London, when Mark Twain said "Rumors of my recent death are greatly exaggerated." I would say, for those of you listening this morning, rumors of Office Depot's death, I believe, are greatly exaggerated. With that, I want to talk about the highlights of the third quarter, give you some insight into our business and at the end of the call, give you an opportunity to ask us questions. So first, kind of from an overall perspective, we reported EPS this morning of 29 cents a share, up 4 percent over the same quarter a year ago. Our international sales grew 71 percent in local currencies, 91 percent (indiscernible) dollars. Our North American Retail traffic transactions were up and our supply categories in our North American Retail stores comp positive. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter is $823 million, again an indication of our ability to generate positive cash flow. Our Guilbert operation is delivering promised results, proceeding on plan and virtually every surprise we've had at Guilbert has been a positive surprise. We completed the successful $400 million long-term debt offering, which helped us pay for our Guilbert strategic acquisition. In spite of the reports you read, we have added significant management talent, particularly in our North American merchandising department, and I believe they will help drive results in the long-term. Finally, we strengthened -- through the appointment of an internal executive -- already the best supply chain in our business, acknowledged by everyone in our business that it is the best, and we made it stronger. We promoted an industry veteran at Office Depot to our contract sales, and I can tell you that organization is strengthened as well. So, that's kind of the highlights of the quarter. On a consolidated sales basis, as you saw, sales -- (technical difficulty) -- 13 percent in the third quarter, 7 percent for the first nine months of the year. Sales increases in BSG, e-commerce and international, including some positive currency impact, partly offset by negative North American Retail comps of 2 percent. Comparable worldwide sales were down 1 percent in the quarter and 2 percent for the nine months. Again, our worldwide e-commerce sales continue to track positively -- 24 percent growth for 672 million on track to achieve $2.5 billion in the year 2003. The consolidated operating profit includes Guilbert -- has continued growth in North America large customer segment, even though our North American Retail comps, as I talked earlier, remained soft. For the third quarter, excluding the impact of EITF, consolidated gross margins were down 27 basis points from last year. As you look at a company our size, as big as we are in many geographies, that's predominantly a product mix issue as opposed to a pricing issue. Total operating expenses were up slightly over last year 40 basis points and operating profit was down slightly last year 67 basis points, most of that in North American Retail. Our third-quarter operating profit performance reflects very strong European results, favorable currency rates, the addition of Guilbert operations for the quarter and strong organic growth, particularly in our BSG European contract business. We have continued growth in are North America large customer segment; I will comment more on that in a minute. The results do include about $6 million of Guilbert integration costs are in the third-quarter operating profit numbers (sic). Our G&A costs were generally flat, although up in dollars, predominantly as a result of the integration and the full-quarter impact of Guilbert. 3 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call On a diluted EPS basis -- 29 cents a share versus 28 GAAP last year. There was a slight positive impact of EITF, which is outlined in our press release, and we did have a little benefit from a declining overall tax rate, part of a long thought out strategy at Office Depot and one of the big advantages we have as a result of having so much of our business outside the United States. On the International segment side, I said sales grew 71 percent in local currencies, 91 percent in U.S. dollars. Excluding Guilbert, sales in dollars in Europe grew 11 percent. E-commerce grew 60 percent. European sales continue to be the growth vehicle for the Company, as we've planned for some time. We've, over the past few years, as all of you know, made a number of investments in Europe in both startups, new countries and most recently Guilbert. It is a significant, important part of our business, has enormous growth characteristics to it, and in spite of what some sales-side analysts say, we're doing fine, thank you very much! This is a great business. We have accelerated sales throughout Europe, predominantly in the quarter. Some softness still in France and Germany, the two big countries of Europe, but strong sales results in other of our barge European countries. On the Operating Profits segment, operating income in this segment grew 88 percent in dollars, 70 percent in local currencies. Foreign currency translation did benefit operating profit this quarter by about $5 million. Gross profit was down a couple hundred basis points, 266 to be precise. That's the inclusion of Guilbert into our mix. That higher prospecting in the Viking catalog model in some countries in Europe, which does result in lower gross margin, but accelerates growth (sic). On the other hand, operating and selling expenses were down 254 basis points as we continue to make improvements on our cost structure and run a high-growth business very efficiently from a cost perspective. Our Guilbert integration, as I said earlier, is proceeding on plan, is delivering synergies and is turning out to be a very, very good acquisition. As we look to the fourth quarter in this big business segment, we have accelerating growth going on in Europe. We will see our best growth quarter in the fourth quarter in Europe in local currencies, as we've seen all year. Our operating margins will show some improvement as we manage costs; we will see gross margins down quarter-over-quarter -- again, the inclusion of Guilbert -- but this business is in accelerating mode and we expect our fourth quarter to be the best growth quarter internationally that we've seen this year. On the North American Business Services Group, sales in total were flat for the quarter and up 2 percent for the first nine months. Contract grew 3 percent, reflecting continued growth in the large customer segment. We have and have always had a very large position in California; it's always been one of our strengths. I don't have to tell you about California and its economy's and the state of the economy in California. If you X-out California, our growth rates in our contract business in North America are high single digit growth rates. Our domestic e-commerce sales rose 11 percent for the quarter. Our Viking sales were essentially flat, and our Office Depot catalog sales were essentially the same rate they've been in the past -- about negative 5, 6 percent. On the operating profits side, operating and selling expenses declined 29 basis points. This is a business in the last two and a half years in which we've taken out more than $100 million of operating costs and are still making progress. In addition to that, all of our quality and our customer service measurements continue to exceed our customers' expectations and our own. Operating profit in this segment is down by about 74 basis points, predominantly a result of lower margins, which reflects a higher mix of contract business, and some vendor rebate rates different than a year ago. Looking to the fourth quarter, this business is also accelerating. We expect low single digit growth in the fourth quarter in spite of our California business. We think gross margins will decline at about the same rate in the fourth quarter as they did in the third, about 200 to 250 basis points. A shift of business, a higher mix of large accounts and some volume-rebate issues, and we continue to expect to see cost improvement in our North American warehouses, in spite of the fact that we've taken so much cost out of it. This is a very good business model and we believe, going into next year, we will see accelerated growth. 4 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call North American Retail -- third-quarter sales were down 1 percent; comps were down 2. It is the second consecutive quarter of sequential improvement. Core office supply sales in our North American Retail stores were up 3 percent, reflecting a strong back-to-school supply performance. Furniture comps negative about 3 percent, a significant improvement over the past four quarters, as some of the initiatives we've invested in furniture begin to show benefits. Technology was a challenge for us in the quarter, as we said it would be during the mid quarter update. Desktops, laptops and monitors were down 21 percent in dollars for the quarter, reflecting both unit issues as well as, in some cases, average selling prices. Traffic in our North American Retail stores for the third quarter was up 4 percent; transactions were up 2 percent in the quarter, so we are driving more of our core business customers to our stores. Average ticket was down about 5 percent, and that accounts for the negative comps. Our customer service indexes were up again, quarter-over-quarter, and we believe our at industry highs. On the operating profit side, as we earlier commented, we saw a gross margin decline of about 100 basis points, reflecting three or four elements, none of which by themselves are significant. There is some clearance activity in our furniture and technology areas as we reset our stores; there is some incremental changes (sic) in shrink, as we've outlined with our ink and toner initiatives. Although I might add, we are substantially through now putting in security systems through our retail stores, which we think will reduce that shrink. This gross margin decline was partially offset by improvements in purchasing and global sourcing of both back-to-school and other items. Operating costs increased about 40 basis points, reflecting predominantly the deleverage of softer sales, significantly higher benefit costs, which, like other companies around the U.S., we are experiencing. It just happens to be most of our employees in North America work in retail and so it has a bigger impact -- and some increased costs associated with our furniture initiative, which we earlier talked about. Our fourth-quarter view of this business is that retail comps will be flat to slightly negative. That would be an improvement over the third quarter and if we achieve that, it will be the third consecutive quarter of sequential improvement. While gross margins in the quarter were down 100 basis points year-over-year, it was our best gross margin performance in Retail this year. We also think we will make progress in gross margin in the fourth quarter. We think now we will be 50 to 100 basis points below the prior year, predominantly a little higher mix of technology, some vendor program changes and some other things by themselves are not material but when added in the aggregate are 30 or 40 basis points (sic). We do expect to see costs as a percentage of sales to decline in our retail stores in the fourth quarter. I might add that I know a number of people have commented that our retail stores are broken. I would point out that, in spite of the enormous challenges of growing retail, this business turned in a 6.6 percent operating profit in the quarter, given its challenges, and given the fact negatively comped. I only point that out because can you imagine what this business will generate in percentage sales when it does return to positive, and it will! Some of the initiatives in North American retail that are (indiscernible) underway -- we did complete a new furniture layout in about 300; it is beginning to show the results we anticipated. Our Millennium remodels are on track. We have basically four stores that are in various stages of being opened at the moment. We think, by year-end, we will have 25 to 30 Millennium stores either open or near the opening stage. Those that don't get opened in the fourth quarter will open early in January. So, we are on track for our 25 to 30 Millenniums; we are optimistic about what we see in the early stores, so this remodel initiative to us is tracking nicely. Our sales indexing in the Millennium stores are tracking above expectations. We also announced, during the quarter, as you know, a test with Albertson's. We are opening 18 Office Depot stores inside Albertson's stores. For those of you who know Albertson's, on of the nation's leading grocers, one of the best grocers in the nation -- in three markets Chicago, L.A. and Phoenix, we have 18 test stores. We are optimistic about this, as is Albertson's, and this has an enormous opportunity for us if this test works. We should know more about that in this fourth quarter. Technology has been a challenge for us at Office Depot for a long time. I hope you've seen the announcement that we've hired a new executive in Technology, John Lostroscio, who comes to us with an enormous amount of experience. We will make some changes in our stores and technology 5 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call and assortment and in layout in the fourth quarter. We are testing a number of new, physical changes in the Technology section that we now look at to roll out in the first quarter. We do think we will see improvement in Technology as a result of some short-term initiatives in the fourth quarter. That kind of summarizes the quarter to date. I want to talk a little bit about the guidance we gave. If you would refer to -- excuse me, I'm sorry. (LAUGHTER). One more comment, please; I'm sorry. Let me talk about the financial highlights. We talked earlier -- the strong quarter ending cash balance of $823 million, inventories are down year-over-year, as well as sequentially from the second quarter. Our North American contract receivables are better than they were year-over-year and sequentially from the second quarter. Our CapEx was 54 million for the quarter and free cash flow for the quarter was $262 million -- again, all reflecting strong working capital measurements, strong discipline in capital spending and part of our commitment to grow return on net assets as we invest in our businesses for the future. We do expect for the year that capital expenditures are on track to hit that 225 to 250 range -- some pullback because of our investment in Guilbert. Our full-year free cash flow we now estimate to be 225 to 250 million, and we do expect to continue to see tax rate drops as the higher mix of our international business and our tax (indiscernible) has impact on the Company. That kind of summarizes the results of the third quarter. I have a few more common I'd like to make, and then we will turn the call over for your questions. If you will refer to our press release, we did give some guidance insight to the fourth quarter. I talked about, as I went through each business unit, kind of our key level assumptions. We did talk about, in the release, three issues that we believe will result in some charge in the fourth quarter. The first of these is our warehouse in Manchester, UK. This was a Viking warehouse built in 1997 that, over the past three or four years, has virtually been sinking into itself. It's built on a piece of property that turns out to not be the best landfill and some structural issues. We have done our best to make this warehouse operational and continue to work. We've concluded now that the damage is significant enough that we will have to relocate this warehouse. We have found a site to do that; we will build a new Manchester warehouse next year. That will cause our CapEx to go up a little bit because that was not a planned event. As a result, we're going to have to take some charges in the fourth quarter to recognize this event. We're dealing with insurance companies and potential litigation. We think sometime in the future these charges might be recovered, but what we do know is we have some charges associated with this event. (indiscernible) like many companies, if you recall, Office Depot, prior to 2000, made a number of investments in Internet startup companies. Like many other companies, the management at that time chose to make some investments in a large number of what were then Internet startup companies with the belief that these would turn out to be highly successful and good investments. It is our conclusion now that, looking at this portfolio of investments, that they basically -- the remaining valuable we have on these investments needs to be adjusted this quarter. We are in the process of finalizing all of that; there is a little more work to be done. There's five remaining investments we have, all made prior to the year 2000. As we complete our work, we're pretty convinced there will be some charges we will have to take to recognize the current status of these companies. Finally, in our retail store area, for all of you as a reminder, we did close 70 stores -- announced that closing at the end of December of 2000. The stores were actually closed in the first quarter of 2001. Some of these stores -- something around less than 25 of these 70 stores still remain on our books, and the best ones, as you can appreciate, went more quickly. We now believe that, looking at the future -- likely that we can lease these stores and sublet them -- will cause us to have to take some additional reserves against these stores, predominantly because of the real estate market. So those three things we will do work on an analyze in the fourth quarter and determine what charges we think are appropriate. Ex those charges, we believe that our business would come in at consensus earnings for the fourth quarter of 2003, ex those charges. We do think those charges, in the aggregate, will be $45 million at the high side, pretax. So, that's kind of a summary. I would like to make one other comment. I know a lot has been said about the management depth and talent. Let me tell you about my day today. When I leave you this morning, I will walk over to our corporate campus and I'll have an opportunity to talk to about 600 or 700 of our managers around the world who are calling in on a conference call. I'll tell them how proud I am of what they've done and how much they've helped this company grow and change. 6 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call A little statistic for you -- the question is, can we add talent? Twenty-five percent of the office of this company have been with the Company now less than three years. We've added enormous talent over, and I'm particularly proud. Then late this afternoon, I meet with the officers of the Company, and we will celebrate those things we're doing well and we will focus on those things that we can do better. We've got a lot to do ahead of us; we've come a long way. I'm more confident than ever about Office Depot's ability to generate the kind of returns that make all of you proud of the Company. Then one final note -- I'd like to say a word about the upcoming investor meeting we've scheduled in Palm Beach on the 28th and 29 of this month. As all of you know, there's a great deal that's going on extremely well at Office Depot I've talked an awful lot about some of those things. I would like to ideally be able to convey that information to you in the context of the Group. But at the moment, because we are missing two pieces of our leadership team, someone now -- a new position to run North America; that's a new position that's trying to be filled -- and someone to replace our merchant; that's an unfilled position. Those are the two key positions unfilled. As many of you are so focused on these issues, my concern is that our message about the many good things we are doing and plan to do and have plans in place to do and have actions in place to do could get lost in the noise around a small number of things we need to address. So, instead of hosting you in Palm Beach later this month, I decided instead to invite you to a lunch in New York on October 29. I will bring along some members of my management team; I'll give you an update where we are with those two key positions and some other key initiatives, and then we will reschedule our more comprehensive meeting with all of you here in South Florida early in 2004. We also plan to provide you with insights into our 2004 strategic plan, and I'm hopeful that I will be able to introduce the new leadership team, the two key members I've talked about, at that time. I would conclude by saying that during my tenure at Office Depot, we've always been committed to providing you meaningful financial and operational disclosure, and we will continue to do so in the future. But in my judgment, the best way to do that now is to meet with all of you and lunch for those of you who would like to attend. Thanks for listening to us this morning. What I'd like to do now is turn the call over to each of you for any questions you might have about our business in the third quarter. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Operator At this time, we are ready to begin the question-and-answer session. (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). Mr. Bill Sims of Salomon Smith Barney. Bill Sims - Salomon Smith Barney - Analyst Good morning. Two questions, if I may? The first question is, can you give us some more color on the initiatives you are pursuing to reverse the negative technology comp trends you're seeing? You just briefly touched upon it in your comments. The second question is, in relation to the mid-quarter update, relative to where we stand today, what type of impact did foreign currency translation have on your earnings? At the end of the mid-quarter update, it had a couple pennies impact. Can you give us an idea of the same impact at the end of the quarter? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer The first question on retail -- I'll give you some level of specificity; I certainly won't give it all to you, for competitive reasons. We will make significant changes in our assortments of technology, particularly in technology items that today have better growth trends and rates to them. One of those categories is likely to be laptops. So, there will be some change. 7 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Second of all, we will expand some of our operating in some of the key technology items which we do extremely well. Third, there will be some physical changes, although minimal, and we think there is also some technology that sells well at the holidays. Without getting specific, a better assortment, a deeper assortment of some categories, a refining of the assortment of some others, and some small physical changes that will make it easier to purchase and buy from Office Depot. That's as specific and I'd like to get at the moment on technology. Relative to your comment about currency, based our mid-quarter update, it's a best guess is that it had a penny less impact than we thought. It did have an impact, but a penny less than we thought, round numbers. Operator Danielle Fox of J.P. Morgan. Danielle Fox - J.P. Morgan - Analyst I have a couple of questions. First, I'm wondering how the Technology category performed at the Millennium stores. Then I just have a quick question about the guidance. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer The Technology section in the Millennium stores is probably one of the highlights of the store. We have a way to measure it; I won't tell you what the index is, because that would be inappropriate, but if you assume that all stores had an index of one, how did Millennium do on that index? The answer to that question is, substantially better. Danielle Fox - J.P. Morgan - Analyst You noted in the press release that there are some planned changes to the plan-o-gram. How are those going to mesh with the Millennium remodels that you have in the works? Are they different versions of it, or how do they -- (Multiple Speakers)? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Danielle, the Millennium is the significant remodel. To remind you, the 350 or $400,000 remodel, which is not just in technology. For those of you who visited Millennium and you look at some of the features we've used in Millennium to better display products, printers, monitors, handheld devices -- it's aspects of those things that we will put into stores. If you will, a piece of it without having to do a whole Millennium (sic) -- and frankly, all stores aren't equal in this regard. We have some stores that do far better in technology than others, so we will be selective where we do this. We just think we've got some specific initiatives that will begin to change the curve on technology. Longer-term, we think we are optimistic. The individual we hired comes to us from a really great background; we believe he's got great industry respect. Certainly, in the three or four weeks he's been at Office Depot, he's already made some changes that we are starting to see some impact from. We've got a lot of confidence in him. So, as those unfold and we get results, we will give you insight to how we got those. Danielle Fox - J.P. Morgan - Analyst Just a quick question on the -- I wanted to understand the comments regarding the fourth-quarter outlook. Does that mean that without the charges, you would have been at 23 cents for the fourth quarter, which is what I think what the consensus (indiscernible) --? 8 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Yes. The answer is, we were comfortable with consensus earnings on our business operations in the fourth quarter, given the insights to each of the segments I told you about. We are fully confident about our ability to achieve consensus earnings, albeit for the charges we will take once we've determined what those are in the aggregate. Danielle Fox - J.P. Morgan - Analyst Okay, just because the flat North American comps are probably a little bit below original expectations, so I'm wondering where you're making up the difference? Where are things coming in better than planned? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer In spite of what some of you think, we run a pretty decent business! We've got some improvement in margins; we've got some improvement in costs; our payroll model is better. Our execution is better; our international is a little better. Our North American warehouses are getting even better than they were, and so this has been an interesting story all year at Office Depot in the sense that, in spite of comps that have disappointed all of us and in spite of continued negative comps, we've managed, throughout the year, to find ways to mitigate these negative comps. It just, in some respects, gives me enormous confidence about our ability when comps go positive, and they will. It gives you some idea of the earning capacity of Office Depot. It's not even one place; it's in a lot of places. That takes talented people to do, not just (indiscernible) and I think the Company has got a lot of talented people. Operator Our next question comes from Mr. Colin McGranahan of Sanford Bernstein. Colin McGranahan - Sanford Bernstein - Analyst Good morning. Two questions, please. First, can you comment a little bit more about the North American catalog business, especially on the Office Depot catalog sales -- you know, negative 5, negative 6 percent? What you seeing there in terms of the same-customer sales? What's the trend in terms of your outlook for that business? It just seems like sales there are pretty weak and we might expect a little improvement there, given how the business spending environment is picking up. Then I have a follow-up. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer First question -- the answer, in the aggregate, is from our core customers, our catalog customers -- we believe we're getting more share of their wallet. One of our challenges has been prospecting, getting new customers and growing that element of the business. Second of all, there is some cannibalization that takes place; it only goes to e-commerce. We think that business will return to growth in 2004. We've made a lot of changes, not the least of which is to put a highly talented, experienced leader to lead both the Viking and the Depot brand. She's here in Delray Beach now. Here name is Ann (indiscernible) and she used to run Australia and then Viking Domestic and frankly, we think she's pretty talented and she will figure this out. Second of all, even in spite of some softening sales, this is an enormously profitable business. Any one person would love to own this business. We think that it will get more positive in growth, and we think they've identified some ways to do that and we're hopeful to show some impact of that, albeit likely to be in the first quarter of next year. 9 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Colin McGranahan - Sanford Bernstein - Analyst Bruce, have you intentionally kind of eased up on prospecting until you had Viking integrated and everything in place? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer No, absolutely not. Colin McGranahan - Sanford Bernstein - Analyst The second question, the debt offering during the quarter -- you now have a sizable cash position again, $800 million. Can you give us a little more insight into what your plans are with that? Again, walk us back through -- there is a rationale for that debt offering. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Let's go to the rationale for the debt offering first. I mean, we bought an enormously good company in Europe called Guilbert, and in round numbers, we paid $1 billion. For any of you that sat in the chair I sit in, or had a talented CFO who sits in the chair next to me, you would say "It makes no sense to buy that business with 100 percent cash." So, you then take advantage of capital markets and interest costs, and you say, you know what? I what some leverage! So part of it is just to leverage the balance sheet. It's financial engineering, and it makes enormous sense. Second of all, this is a great story to have, a great problem to have. Isn't it nice to have a problem of having too much money? I've said and I will say all over again and I don't how to say this differently, but -- first of all, one of the things about Office Depot that I like a lot about is we tell you what we're going to do; we explain it in enormous detail, sometimes to a fault. Then we tell you how we did it. We have said, I have said, the management team has said, we will invest this money to grow our business or we will give it back to shareholders. So, the best indication of what you can do in the future is to look at the past. We took $1 billion of our hard earned cash and bought a great business. We are still open to finding vertical acquisitions to help our business. We still search the world to say, "Is their talent we can buy? Is there businesses (sic) that we can get? Can they add to our business model?" If we can't identify ways to do that internally, then we have to give the money back. If you give the money back, there's two ways you do it. You know this better than I; you buy back stock or you give it back in dividends. Neither one of those things would I rule out at Office Depot in the future. But for the moment, we run our business. Operator Our next question comes from Mr. Michael Baker of Deutsche Bank. Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank - Analyst Great, thanks. Two questions -- one, can you discuss the comp trend sequentially in the third quarter and how we're looking as we head into the fourth quarter? What gives you the confidence that you will continue to see some sequential improvement in the fourth quarter? I know there's an easier comparison, but is it more some of the benefits you expect to get from those short-term technology initiatives you talked about, or is there something else? 10 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Generally speaking, the comp trends in the quarter were a mixed story. There were days and weeks in which comps were very good, exceeding our expectations, and they were days and weeks when comp trends were below our expectations. September finished the least-best month in comps than did the prior two months. Looking forward, why do we think that's different? Because, first of all, we've got some insight into our programs and plans to drive the business in the fourth quarter. Second of all, we are facing easier comparisons. Third, our initiatives that we have invested in -- remember, our supply comps were positive, and so the initiative about ink and toner and writing instruments and binders and the other things were, in fact, positive in the third quarter and we have every reason to believe that they will continue those trends in the fourth quarter. So, given our best look at the business, that's our best guess at this point; that's kind of what we think the business will trend, and we think it's neutral to slightly negative. That's our most educated, best guess as we look at the business from where we sit on whatever day of October this is -- 16th. Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank - Analyst Thanks. Then one follow-up -- what are you seeing in terms of pricing in North America? Any change there? What are your promotional plans, heading into the holiday season? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer We've said all along the there's clearly been more aggressive, selective pricing in North America retail (inaudible). When I mean selective, I mean targeted. I mean individual customer offers. That's true for us and our competitors as well. From a general (indiscernible) prospective, I think pricing is fairly benign in retail stores, albeit we have, I believe, all in engaged in more promotional activity in the form of either coupons and/or direct-mail offerings that work and drive traffic to stores. We anticipate to continue to do that. Our margins in the fourth quarter in retail historically are less in the fourth quarter than they are in the third. It's usually a merchandise mix. Technology, historically, is a little bigger part of our mix as businesses buy business gifts. We think that will be true, too, but the delta from last year in retail will be the smallest delta in the entire year. So still some slight pressure on margins, but not exasperated and nothing that would concern me about our inability to -- well, our ability to sustain acceptable margins. As I said, even in spite of negative comps and some pressure on margins, this retail business that we have here in North America still did an admirable job in the quarter of (inaudible) 6 percent return on sales. Clearly, we think we can make that growth better but I think, given the whole environment, that's pretty admirable -- not that we don't want to improve it. Operator Our next question comes from Mr. Matthew Fassler of Goldman Sachs. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs - Analyst Good morning. A couple of questions, some financial details first -- what kind of tax rate do you anticipate, going forward, both for the fourth quarter and 2004? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer I'm going to turn that over to Charlie. 11 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Charles Brown - Office Depot - Chief Financial Officer Matt, good morning. The tax rate should be the same in the fourth quarter (inaudible) and we expect to blend out to a 32 percent rate for the full year. That's the rate that we're projecting for next year as well. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs - Analyst Thirty-two percent, okay. Secondly, can you talk to the impact of currency on overall earnings? You talked about the delta of the impact of currency from you had initially expected. You said it was up a penny better than you projected in early September. In the aggregate, what kind of EPS change reflected the -- (Multiple Speakers)? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Matt, I don't have that at my fingertips at the moment. If we can either go off-line with you, or for those that want to know, call us; we'll give it to you. I just don't have it at my fingertips at the moment. It's slightly (indiscernible) -- year-over-year, it's favorable. I think, in the quarter, that it's about a $5 million favorable year-over-year in international directionally close to (indiscernible) -- year-over-year. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs - Analyst Year-over-year, so 5 million would be --? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Year-to-date is about five, so I think -- I think it's about a penny in the quarter and a penny for the year, but we will go back and get more specificity on that for you. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs - Analyst That would be helpful. The third question -- just a minor detail -- the other operating expenses line, not a huge number, but it was meaningfully bigger this quarter than I believe it had been recently. I'm just curious as to what -- (Multiple Speakers). Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer It's virtually all Guilbert. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs - Analyst What piece of Guilbert's number would you count in other operating expenses? In other words, it wouldn't go in G&A, or it wouldn't be allocated (inaudible) the divisions. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Ask that again. 12 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs - Analyst I guess I'm asking the question because it's a $7.5 million number. It was 1.5 million in the first half of the year and $3 million in the year ago quarter, so I guess I'm wondering what would be assigned to that line item that wouldn't be allocated either to the divisional P&Ls or to corporate G&A? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer You know, Matt, I'm going to have to get back to you. From my perspective -- this is kind a the general view, the change in our operating costs is virtually all Guilbert related. How we got there, we will just have to go off-line with you -- (multiple speakers). So if you would, I'm sorry, we will go off-line with you, but it is Guilbert and the impact Guilbert has in the full quarter. This is the first full quarter of Guilbert. We had one month of Guilbert in the last quarter, I believe. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs - Analyst The final question I have, can you talk about how inventory looks channel by channel? In other what, what your U.S. retail inventory looks like, BSG and international, just to get a sense as to the --? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer We don't break out inventory by channel, but the inventory actually went down third quarter in spite of Guilbert's inclusion inventory. We expect inventory in the fourth quarter to go up slightly as we build for our January build, but in absolute dollars, inventory went down third quarter, even when we include Guilbert. We don't break inventory out by segment. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs - Analyst Can you give us a sense as to how the U.S. retail inventories look? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Yes. U.S. retail inventories are fine. I'm not concerned about U.S. retail inventories. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs - Analyst Okay, thanks so much. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer It goes back -- again, one of our real strengths has been our supply chain. (indiscernible) all of you get a chance to meet the individual who now heads that, you'll be as encouraged or more encouraged than I about our ability to do that. So, I'm not concerned about inventory levels any place in the business. I think our inventory levels today are appropriate; I believe we manage them well; I believe that by consolidating our supply chain, we will even get better at it. I would think, looking to 2004, that there's an opportunity to take inventory out of the supply chain in 2004. I anticipate that Mark, in his new role, will find new ways to do that. I would bet a lot of money on it. Operator Our next question comes from Mr. Jeff Black of Lehman Brothers. 13 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Jeff Black - Lehman Brothers - Analyst Good morning, Bruce. The question related on the inventory -- you know, in terms of the clearance that you've been doing for most of the year, how far are we through all the clearance activity related to the furniture and technology recess? In addition, can you give us a sense of what the changes in mix have been, year-to-year, or what appreciable changes you can talk about that there have been in the inventory mix? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Let's go to the first question first. First of all, any retailer seller has clearance; that is part of the way you do business. I mean, when you go back-to-school any don't sell it all, you have clearance. When you have holiday and don't sell all your clearance, you plan it; you build it into your model; you look at it before you do it and you clear it. Now, we've had some higher levels of clearance in our furniture pads. I'd say that the dominance of that is behind us. We've had some clearance in technology; I would say that the predominance of that is behind us. But in technology, you always have clearance because manufacturers today have a way of, every three or four months, changing technology, and you have to clear out the old; it's part of your model. So, I think the predominance of that is behind us. Your second question, Jeff, was what? Jeff Black - Lehman Brothers - Analyst In terms of where you want to take the mix, where are we now? You probably won't discuss your specific plans, but can you give us any sense of where there have been real changes in the mix, whether it's within technology or within furniture? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer If you look at mix, if you look over the past two and a half years and ask why we haven't positively comped, it's been all about changes in furniture and technology being a lower percentage of our business. In some respects, we pay for our early adopter. We were the first superstore to emphasize furniture in a big way. We were, by far, the first superstore to emphasize technology in a big way. Those grew to be much larger percentages of our sales -- in fact led to why the average sales per week in our stores generally was larger than our competitors. By the way, they were profitable sales. They have a market (inaudible) with them. In the last three years, (indiscernible) both those categories had declined. What we would like to see is technology grow back to be a larger percent of our sales, furniture be a large part of our sales and continue to positive grows supply (sic), which we have shown we can and do well. So, I mean, that, in general, answers it. We do break out in the Q, and the Ks that product mix, and you can go track those over time. We've consistently measured the same items in the same categories, so that would give you a little more insight. I don't have that at my fingertips, Jeff, or I'd give it to you. Operator Our next question comes from Mr. Aram Rubinson of Banc of America. Aram Rubinson - Banc of America Securities - Analyst Good morning. I've got three quick things, I guess. Traffic you mentioned was up four; transactions were up two. It sounds like that's a new ways for you guys to measure the performance of the retail stores. I'm always curious how people kind of gauge the traffic levels and if you're measuring the performance of those stores differently. That's the first. 14 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call The second is on BSG. I know you've only recently had change of management there, but what, if any, changes to the business plan or program do you think might come as a result? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer There are two questions. First of all, we have been measuring traffic for some time, and we've got -- it's a somewhat less than scientific way to do it, but we use some technology to measure traffic into the store. We've been measuring conversion rates for well over two years to try and measure that which comes in the store, how many we (indiscernible) coming out. That's a key measurement, so it's been part of our measurement for some time. It's an indication to us of how the business is doing and so, over time, our conversion rates have gone up. It just gives -- it's just some ways to get insight into our business, so we've measured them for some time and I'm encouraged by traffic because it measures sometimes our ability to understand how our ads are doing. The second question is related to Cindy Campbell, who has been in her new job about three weeks. I might point out Cindy Campbell has been in this company eight years and was the person responsible for opening up the Southeast of o, predominantly Atlanta, on the contract side, where we do very, very well and have always done very, very well. I think one of the many characteristics I like about Cindy is one, she knows the business extremely well. Two is that she is well thought of inside the Company. When it comes to hiring or developing people, Cindy gets enormously high marks. Three is, never underestimate her competitiveness. She finds a way to win, and she's got some plans that she will put in place. I don't think it's appropriate at the moment to tell our shareholders what they are before we fully inform our own sales organization, but I'm confident that this business will grow. I said earlier -- I'm not -- you know, California is really an important state to Office Depot in the union, but you ex-out California and we have a contract business that's growing at near double-digit growth. I think that's pretty admirable and if I look at the areas that Cindy has had in that regard, that happens to be the areas of the country she led, so that gives me quite a bit of conference in here -- I mean, what she might do and how she might do it. As I said, the addition of those two executives -- while some of you look at that as a loss, I frankly look at it again -- (multiple speakers) -- supply chain because of it, and we do better in contract sales because of it. For one thing, we will get better focus. In the end, this will be better than it is worse at Office Depot. Aram Rubinson - Banc of America Securities - Analyst One last thing -- I was in a store that was being converted over to a Millennium about a week or so ago, and the store was gutted pretty good. They did it in -- I don't think -- in a long amount of time; it seemed a pretty tight time frame. But have you built in any disruption if you are going to do an incremental 20 or 25 or so in the fourth quarter -- into the comp? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer The answer is yes. Again, in the fourth quarter, we're talking about 20 to 25 stores that could be disrupted, and for the store you were in, there's no question it's disruptive and frankly, we're trying a couple of things to do to minimize the disruption that are kind of unusual. We've closed the store for a couple of days, and we were able to direct a fair amount of the traffic to that store to a nearby Office Depot store. So, we're trying to find ways to minimize the impact but clearly, when you tear a store apart and you put 350, $400,000 into it, you've got disruption. As best we can, we've said that's kind of in our numbers. So, it's still a big guess. As we learn more about Millennium -- one of the reasons we test 25 or 30 of them is we've got to get better at doing them quicker and faster and less disruptive and part of this is a test for us. Aram Rubinson - Banc of America Securities - Analyst Thanks, Bruce. We will see you on the 29th. 15 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Operator Our last question comes from Mr. Dan Binder of Buckingham Research. Dan Binder - Buckingham Research - Analyst A couple of questions -- first, with regards to the merchandising you've done thus far this year and what you plan on doing in the fourth quarter with Technology, I guess I'm kind of curious why the retail outlook is not a little bit more robust, especially in Technology, since you have some plan changes there. Secondly, my understanding was that you're doing things in Catalog, I guess during the third quarter, that would help see some acceleration in the fourth quarter. It looks like, in your press release, you've indicated that there won't be any improvement. So I guess my first question is really with regard to what is different than it was versus last quarter? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Well, I pause for a minute, Dan, because there's a lot of factors that go into it. I think -- you know, again, based on how we try to communicate and articulate the trends of our business, we try to give you as much insight, accuracy and preciseness as possible. Do I think there could be -- am I hopeful there is some upside in Technology in the fourth quarter? Yes. But you know what, John's been with us three weeks, and I'm at the point when it's kind of like the movie says, "Show me the money!" So if it starts to accelerate, that would be good news. Second of all, on the Catalog side, we have made some progress. New customers are up. They take a while to -- you've got to retain them and grow their share of wallet and that takes a little effort and time. We're just trying to be realistic for the moment as we look at the business, as opposed to unrealistic or pessimistic. It isn't any lack of effort or understanding about the business that causes us to be that way; we are just saying, "Look, that's our best guess at the moment." If we do better than that, I'd be delighted to tell you about it. So, it's our best educated guess as to how we look at the business on the 15th of October, looking to 2.5 months in advance, knowing the initiatives we've got, the actions we've taken and those we plan to take. So, I don't know how -- (multiple speakers) -- different than that, Dan. It's certainly not a lack of confidence in both teams to do this and the long-term capability to generate the kind of results we all want to have, in spite of the fact that we generate pretty decent results. Dan Binder - Buckingham Research - Analyst In terms of a follow-on, the Technology re-merchandising you did in the Millennium format you seem pretty pleased with. In terms of timing for the rest of the chain, are you going to see the full technology remerchandising done in the fourth quarter? Versus what's been done already, how is your new merchant sort of viewing his plans? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Well, I think one thing that's happened with the new merchant is we're probably not going to go as quickly with the physical changes, the major ones we were going (inaudible) during the fourth quarter. I want to step back of that. He's got some ideas which I think make more sense. He is doing some things in terms of assortment and display and items and depth of some things that are more immediate in nature. We are testing a couple of different formats. We're going to let that test run a little further, I think, in terms of the physical changes themselves. I think, overall, John's look at the technology in Marietta, the one store that's open, (indiscernible) looks and says, "This is a really good way to display and sell technology." He just thinks there's a couple of categories we ought to be deeper in, he thinks there's a couple of categories we ought to be lighter in, and I think we will switch those that are deeper, that are higher sell and have less than those that don't sell as many. I'm talking code here because I'm not going to give away the specific SKU strategy we are going to have in the fourth quarter or first. Early on, I think John would say, I think we can get this business back to growing. So, -- (Multiple Speakers) -- he's got lots of experience. I trust him. We will see what happens. 16 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Dan Binder - Buckingham Research - Analyst So are we looking at -- I guess the plan was to re-merchandise the category across the store base in Q4. Are we not going to see that, or just seeing subtle changes? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer I think you'll see smaller changes. By the way, it was never the full chain, Dan, because the full chain doesn't work. We don't have 850 stores that have technology that's equal. Like, we clearly know those stores at Office Depot that do better in technology. It's the 80/20 rule, and we will focus efforts on that. We will make some smaller changes in the assortment and some physical things and wait a little with (indiscernible) longer for the larger, physical changes. We think we will get incremental results of the smaller ones. We just want to just want to make sure when we get it, we get it right and we do it right so it's not a lack of confidence; it's just, "here's a new guy; we think highly of him. Let's give him a little running room here. He's got some ideas. In the meantime, he thinks he can accelerate the sales!" So that's our position. Dan Binder - Buckingham Research - Analyst Have you completed the furniture remerchandising? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Furniture is done in 300 stores. The question is, do we take it to more? That's a store-by-store basis. But our major furniture (indiscernible) is done in 300 stores that count. So the answer is, there probably will be some others that go to it, but the stores that are the biggest contributors to furniture have got this furniture reset in them. We also will launch (inaudible) -- we will launch, we think, an interesting new concept from Furniture sometime this quarter. I won't go further than that. (indiscernible) if we've done it yet, but it's an interesting line of furniture; it will be exclusive at Office Depot. We think it hits our target market. We think it will be a really good thing. It will be launched sometime in the fourth quarter. We will tell you more about it later. Dan Binder - Buckingham Research - Analyst Sorry to take up so much time on this, but just one last question -- you've had good expense control over the last several quarters and yet, the sales have, in some areas, gotten somewhat better, but overall been a little bit lower than expected. I guess my question is, is there anything you're doing on the expense side in terms of cuts that maybe is prohibiting sales growth? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer No. Dan Binder - Buckingham Research - Analyst Okay, thanks. Operator This concludes the questions. 17 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

CONFERENCE CALL PARTICIPANTS Diane Daggatt McAdams Wright Ragen - Analyst Dara Edmonds Alpine Mutual Funds - Analyst Nicholas Aberle Caris & Company - Analyst Rob Maten Schneider Capital - Analyst PRESENTATION Operator Good morning and welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the Alexander & Baldwin, Inc. fourth-quarter and year end conference call. At this time I'd like to inform you that this conference is being recorded and that all participants are in a listen only mode. At the request of the company we will open the conference up for questions and answers after the presentation. I will now turn the conference over to John Kelley. Please go ahead, sir. John Kelley - Alexander & Baldwin - VP of IR Good morning. This is John Kelley in Honolulu. This morning our logistics are just a little bit different because the rest of the people on the call representing the Company are in Oakland, California, so this is the first one we're not in the same room. But in Oakland are Allen Doane, President and CEO of A&B; Jim Andrasick, Executive Vice President and CFO of ABN, President and CEO of Matson Navigation Company. And we're also very pleased to welcome our colleague, Chris Benjamin, who is newly appointed the CFO and Vice President of A&B effective February 9th. Chris will just be listening with us today but we're glad to have him. As is typical in the call, I'll do this brief introduction and then Allen will give an overview of the financial performance and some words about the outlook; Jim will comment on the financials; I'll give a quick review of the Hawaii economy and then we'll open for your questions by click SKU (ph) polling. If anyone has trouble hearing the call, please dial star zero and the operator will help you out. Copies of our release are at the A&B website, and special invitees on the call who are able to ask questions should have been faxed or e-mailed copies of the release this morning. There will be a replay available on the Web for one week, and I'm always willing to take calls later on. There is a five hour time difference at this time of the year with Eastern time. Statements in the call that set forth our expectations and predictions are based on faxed and situations that are known to us as of today, January 23, 2004. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties such as those we describe on page 19 of the Form 10-K and our 2002 annual report. I would remind listeners of our corporate website, www.AlexanderBaldwin.com, and its links to our subsidiary's Websites. With that I would like to invite Allen Doane to make some comments about the quarter and the outlook. Allen. Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO Thank you, John. I would like to introduce again and congratulate Chris Benjamin on his appointment as Chief Financial Officer of A&B, and also note that our controller, Tom Wellman, has been named a Vice President of the company as well as treasurer. So we're quite pleased to have had these promotions and have the opportunity to have Chris with us today. So, welcome, Chris. 2 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

JANUARY 23, 2004 / 4:00PM, - Q4 2003 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Chris Benjamin - Alexander & Baldwin - CFO, Vice President Thank you. Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO I'd also like, just at the outset, express appreciation to Jim Andrasick who has one head but wears two hats for a period of time. He's done an exceptional job in the financial area for the Company and also, as you've seen here, produced some very good results at Matson Navigation. So Jim will be sailing off into the operating role at Matson here in the future. And it's a great assignment for him. I would like to just talk briefly about the quarter and then to make a few comments about the full year and then our outlook for 2004. The quarter ended close to expectations, 44 cents per share earnings versus 43 in the prior year. We got there a little differently than we might have that we would at the beginning of the year, but nonetheless from an operating standpoint it was a good quarter overall. Let me turn to the quarterly results and -- if I can for a moment, and I'll pause just briefly as we go through these various items. If you could go to the transportation -- ocean transportation segment, for the quarterly material, and it's page two in my release but it may look somewhat different for you. That is Matson Navigation. It's hard to make sense of the prior year versus 2003 due to the labor disruptions that occurred in 2002's fourth quarter. To some extent, because of that those very large increases in volume in containers and automobiles that you see can be discounted somewhat in the last quarter of 2003 because of the disruptive effects on volume in 2002. Well, how do we see the quarter? We see it as a good quarter and kind of let me give you our perspective on it. If you start with the 32.4 million of operating profit, we did include a statement in our release about a onetime curtailment settlement gain on a pension plan. That is $16.7 million pretax. If you remove that 16.7 million from the 32 plus million of operating profit, and then let me just give you one more number, if you add back $6 million for two other non operating items that dealt with a nonqualified pension plan and other pension expense items. If you add that back as a $6 million item, essentially what that does is that gives you an operating profit in the quarter of about $22 million. So you've reduced or you've taken out the gain that you got of 16.7 and then you've added back $6 million of expense items that were unusual in nature. If you take that 22 million and you divide it by $199 million of revenue in the quarter, that gives you an operating margin of about 11 percent. That is kind of a typical margin for the fourth-quarter for this business. It's also important to note, while it doesn't show up directly on the P&L, there was a major fleet reconfiguration in the fourth quarter. We had a new vessel introduced to the service. It's the first time that's happened since 1992, and it was done successfully. We also had the first voyage of a newly leased auto carrier, they're called roro ships, that occurred in the quarter as well. So there was just a lot of changing in the fleet which had some onetime costs attendant to it in the quarter. I would just then turn to the transportation logistics service quarterly results. And would note there that the numbers are small in terms of operating income, particularly the margins are relatively small versus revenue, but it's that kind of business, small but very good performance. I would then ask you to turn to property development and management leasing, probably one-page further along. For the quarter we had operating profit of 9.8 million versus 8.4 million in last year's quarter. That's a 17 percent increase. That's not sustainable but we did have good occupancy rate stability on the mainland, a little bit of rate improvement in Hawaii, a few more properties and overall the results were quite good in the leasing segment. I would then next turn to our property development and management sales segment. Their operating profit was 2.7 million versus 5.2 million in the prior year's quarter. I would suggest that you not be concerned about the drop in quarterly profitability there. This is the one segment of our business where quarterly results can be lumpy, episodic. Here it's better to look at the full year trendline versus any one quarter. And when you look at the full year you'll note that we have had very good results. 3 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

JANUARY 23, 2004 / 4:00PM, - Q4 2003 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call If you would then turn to our food products segment, and look at the quarter results there, .5, a half-million dollars of operating profit versus 5.8 million in the prior year's quarter. We had a disappointing end to 2003, we produced 49,000 tons of sugar versus 61 last year. You're really comparing a poor quarter to what had been a superb quarter in 2002 for the end of the year. We did have some malicious fires earlier in the year that really affected the production for the fourth-quarter, but it did not at all fully explain the drop in production. So that was not a good operating result for the quarter and, as we'll talk in a moment, for the year. I would then like to go to a couple paragraphs down in the report, it's on page 6 of our report, but it's after the full year numbers for the food products segment. There's a comment about the Company writing down our investment in C&H Sugar. We did have a permanent impairment. The investment in that business was written down from $11.5 to $3.8 million. That was a hit to earnings of $7.7 million pretax. So that business is now on our books and the 36 plus percent ownership that we had in it is in at a value of $3.8 million. In the interest of time I'm just going to make a few comments on the full year and on our outlook for 2004. And then I'll end with an update on a few of a real estate projects that last quarter I had been asked to do to give you an update on that now at this meeting. For the full year Matson had excellent recovery. Matson is now operating pretty close to the level it should be at. It does get complicated, but again, if you were to remove the benefit of that onetime pension gain, and then also remove from operating results about a $10 million pension expense that had run through the year pretty much ratably on a quarterly basis, you'd come to the conclusion instead of having earnings of 92.8 million in the year that our running rate for Matson is more in the mid to high $80 million of operating income versus 93. We do believe that we will have a very good year at Matson in 2004, but it's going to be more of an incremental improvement in income rather than the large recovery growth that we experienced in 2003. In the logistics business, if you look at our profit for the full year on the industry segment versus 2002, it was an excellent year. We had earnings of 4.7 million in operating profit versus 3.1 million the prior year. We expect that segment of the business to have continuing growth. We've got a capable and energetic management group there and a good growth strategy. So we expect that business to continue to grow. Our leasing segment that's had $37 million of operating profit versus 32.9 million in the prior year, we don't expect to sustain the kind of growth in '04 that we had in '03. So you'll see low growth there after an excellent 2003. The development segment had almost $24 million of operating income versus 19.4 in 2002. You can expect to see continuing strong growth in that segment of the business in 2004. And then with food products, the 5.1 million versus 13.8 million in the prior year, there's uncertainty in this business. We should have better production in 2004, but sugar prices have been trending down, and it's not likely you're going to see growth in that segment's income, and there is some prospect that it could decline. I would just make an overall comment that for A&B that we expect to have, on an aggregate basis, a sustainable rate of growth in income in 2004, but we're not going to have the type of very large growth that we experienced in the year 2003. But we are expecting a good year. Let me conclude by giving an update on several projects, all of which are in affect new investments for the company in the last year or less. The first is our Alakea office building in downtown Honolulu. It was acquired in March of 2003, 31 floors, small floor -- about 5500 square foot floor plates (ph). We bought it for $20 million. Of the 31 floors we did something very unusual, instead of leasing it out we're selling it as office condominiums. We have at this point sold nine of the 31 floors for over $10 million. We have another 3.5 floors under binding contracts, and an additional five floors in the letter of intent stage so that essentially about 18 out of the 31 floors are either sold or committed. And with these transactions closed or closing we'll be getting close to recovering our initial investment value in the property. So the prospects there are very, very good, the results have been outstanding. The second project is our Lanikea project in Waikiki. It's the first highrise in Waikiki in almost 15 years. We just turned the first earth over on that project in the last 30 days. We've also gone from a sales program to a point where we are now collecting binding contracts for the sale of the 100 units in this project. This is a 100 percent A&B owned development. We have 97 of the 100 units sold, 88 are on a binding basis. We at this point in 4 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

JANUARY 23, 2004 / 4:00PM, - Q4 2003 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call time have sold them for an average of $574,000 a unit. We are meeting our very high expectations for this project. We will not have an income effect here until 2005 however when the project is completed and the actual transactions close. The third project is our Hokua project in Honolulu. That is a 50-50 joint venture with the McNaughton Group and the Kobayashi Group, prominent local developers in Hawaii. This is a luxury 247 unit condominium in a very well located place. Of the 247 units, 235 are under contract, 226 of those 235 are under binding contracts. We have approximately $230 million of revenue under contract for this condominium. This is another project that, just in the last 30 to 45 days, has gone from a concept and a sales program to both having binding contracts, and earth has also been turned here. This project is also meeting the very high expectations that had been set for it on an investment basis. We're investing $40 million as an equity owner. And we would expect that we could begin to see the results of this at the end of 2005, probably maybe in the fourth-quarter, but it's a little too early to say just yet. So there's no impact on that in '04, but you'll be seeing that one later on. The last project, and certainly the most significant, was our acquisition of Wailea. This was completed early in the fourth-quarter of 2003 for $67 million. We expanded the transaction to you in the last call. It was a split off approach where we bought the undeveloped land, approximately 270 acres, and were able to arrange a simultaneous purchase with a partner -- of some very, very attractive golf course real estate. We only have -- we have 17 parcels representing the 270 developable acres of residential land. We're only in a position at this point to sell one of these 17 parcels on in effect a subdivided basis. There are 29 lots in the first parcel that is -- actually the sales activity started midway through the fourth-quarter of 2003. Of the 29 single-family lots in this first subdivision, 19 have either been sold or are under -- 19 have actually been sold under binding contracts, and we have two additional non-binding sales. So that would be 21 of 29 single-family lots, average price of $790,000. It's our first indication of market response to the new inventory at Wailea, inventory that hasn't been available for a number of years. We're getting positive results. And we do expect to achieve income -- a fairly substantial amount of income from these first single-family lot sales in 2004. In addition to that, of the 16 remaining subdivideable parcels, we're going through a process of really dividing them into three categories. We're going to sell some in bulk, we're going to joint venture some of the parcels, and then we'll also take parcels and develop them ourselves. Because it's going to take two years and maybe even a little bit longer to get to the point where we're able to either joint venture or develop parcels on our own, that we're in the process of pursuing some bulk sales to other developers, and these could have income impacts and should have an income impacts in 2004 and 2005. We're not in a position to describe them in detail yet, but I can just give you assurance that the program that we're embarked on now was the very same program that we used to purchase the property and to make our initial plan. So we're on track, a little bit ahead of where we thought we would be at this point with Wailea, and are very pleased with the initial results. So that I'm going to turn it over to you, Jim, in your last capacity today as the Chief Financial Officer of A&B. Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - CFO, President & CEO of Matson Navigation co. Thank you, Allen, and thanks for the kudos you expressed earlier on behalf of Matson's thousand plus salary, and barring union employees I think I -- we owe it all to them for this fine performance during the last year. I would like to confine my comments to the industry segment data page initially, that starts with revenue by segment and operating profit, and go down to the income tax line. Just to make a couple of quick comments on below the line items, our tax rates in 2003, it was 37 percent effective rate. That compares with 33 percent last year. So that's a 400 basis point increase. And the reason for that is we had a number of very large residential credits in '02 and also the settlement of a -- several state income tax audits which were favorable to the company, those did not repeat in '03. So I think a good proxy for those of you who try to estimate '04 and beyond would be a 37 percent effective rate for the company, that comports with our historical averages and I would say it's more likely to be lower than higher, but 37 percent is a good number to use. 5 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

JANUARY 23, 2004 / 4:00PM, - Q4 2003 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call On the very bottom of that industry segment page you'll see average shares outstanding have increased, and for the quarter they were up to 42 million. Most of that increase was due to option exercises throughout 2003, and in dollar terms that added a little more than $20 million to our shareholder's equity. About 850,000 shares were exercised during the year at an average price of a little over $24. I'd like to make some brief comments about the balance sheet. This compares actual '03 versus actual '02 and just comment on the major highlights because there were a number of fairly significant changes. The first really is in our investment accounts, 68 million. That was up 35 million during the year. And you may recall that we contributed land to the KuKuiUla joint venture at a value of $28 million early in the year as well as one of the projects that Allen just mentioned, the Hokua project, 10 million in the calendar year. The combination of those to investments explains the entire amount of the increase of that account. I'd also note that the carrying value of C&H is -- on a written down basis -- is contained within that 68.4 million. Our real estate development accounts were up sharply from 42 million to 77 million. But most of that, in fact all of that was the Wailea acquisition which closed on October 1st of this year -- in '03 rather, and that was offset by the KuKuiUla land which shifted basically from real estate developments to investments. So a net increase of about 35 million there. The property accounts also were up, and I'll save some of the explanation on our capital spending experience and what our forecast is when I discuss cash flow. But serve (ph) it to say that most of the increase in the property side was the vessel acquisition at Matson which accounted for 100 million of that $136 million increase. In part to finance that vessel we drew down our capital construction fund by about $43 million net of earnings in the fund during the year. And our other asset accounts increased by about 30 million, and most of that was related to the various pension accounts including this onetime settlement gain that Allen has already described. On the liability side, nothing noteworthy in current liabilities. Our long-term debt has increased as a result of our higher capital spending, and we fixed more depth during the year to take advantage of what we thought was a favorable interest rate environment. We put $53 million of title -- what's called title 11 debt against the new vessel, we also fixed an additional $50 million approximately in other long-term intermediate term borrowings. So debt levels increased 82 million since the end of 2002. We took advantage of that rate environment to pay off some state revenue bonds in Hawaii, and that had been categorized in other long-term liabilities, so all of the decrease there was a result of paying off those revenue bonds and very small movements in our deferred tax accounts. Shareholders equity increased by more than earnings less dividends. As may of you know, comprehensive income is an accounting device where various changes in benefit accounts do not go through the P&L but rather get charged or credited directly to our shareholder's equity. And in this case for 2003 we had a $20 million pickup because of favorable performance in our asset accounts relating to pension plans and several other activities. And this is also where 20 million plus in stock option exercises contributed. So overall net increase in shareholders equity was 87 million, and the book value per-share at the end of 2003 was $19.22, that was up $1.68 from the same value -- same measure at the end of 2002. If I could just turn and make some quick comments on cash flow. Clearly operating cash flows were up smartly, most of that driven by increases in earnings performance from the various business units as well as some favorable current liability and tax payable positions at the end of the year. Capital expenditures at 214 million were obviously much higher than 2002 as planned and as expected. The new vessel purchase, as well as a number of different property acquisitions, accounted for that increase. And just to give you some idea of how that compares by business segment, of the 214 million, the way that breaks down is properties was 66 million, which I'll explain further in a moment, ocean transportation was 133 million, and ag and other was about 13 million. But not included in the property spending in this account are amounts added to inventory which for the year 2003 totaled about $35 million, those are actually included in operating cash flows above. As well as properties purchased using tax-deferred proceeds on the sale of other assets, and those totaled 41 million during 2003. So when you combine all of that in our properties group, total spending and commitments were 142 million during the year which was up substantially from the prior year. I would also comment on our outlook for spending in '04. We believe that ocean transportation will be at about 6 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

JANUARY 23, 2004 / 4:00PM, - Q4 2003 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call the same levels because another vessel is under construction with expected delivery in the third or fourth quarter of 2004, as well as several normal equipment replacement and systems projects that we have on the boards. And the properties area we expect spending to be about the same, although it's always difficult to predict given the episodic nature of a number of our projects. But the three projects Allen outlined, or four, will consume some capital during their development phases in '04 and most of the benefits to come in '05 and beyond. So, on the capital side we're looking at about the same levels in '04 as we experienced in '03. With that, John, I would like to turn it over to John Kelley who will talk about some of the Hawaii factors which greatly influence all of our businesses. John. John Kelley - Alexander & Baldwin - VP of IR Thanks, Jim. I think just from an overview point of view, right now Hawaii is operating from a macroeconomic basis in what you might call its sweet spot, and that I would characterize is about a 3 to 4 percent real growth rate. And I think the point here is that in an island economy, growth can get out of whack relatively easily so it's very important to grow at a rate that prevents imbalances in infrastructure, and especially things that might affect the property development business. And I think we're now operating at that level and it looks to be sustainable. Just from a couple statistics on the visitor industry because from a psychological point of view it's very important to the investment willingness of the local business community. The US visitors continue to grow at a fairly steady rate, and the international visitors are recovering, but the process month-to-month is somewhat bumpy. Looking at the third quarter, total visitors were up a little more than 1 percent, and the visitor day census was up just about 4 percent. And within that number the US component, almost 5 percent increase in visitors whereas international visitors from all countries were down about 7 percent. Inside those numbers US West and US East contributed to growth and Japan was still off a bit on the international side. Moving forward in time, in November the total visitor count was up about .3 percent of which the US component was up 2 percent and the perennially strong US West was up almost 6 percent. And on the international side of that number the total was down 3, but for the first month since March Japan was up almost 2 percent and that was fairly nice and noteworthy. So it is a little bit bumpy but I think generally we still have sustained strength from US West and a gradual recovery from Japan on the international side since they are the largest driver. As we look ahead, the forecast for the '03 add is about a 6/10 of 1 percent decline, and that would lead us to about 6.4 million visitors for the year, and the outlook is for about a 6 percent increase that would take us to 6.8 million in calendar year '04. And just for reference the high was 6.9 million in the year 2000. So the outlook looks fairly strong. And I think one contributing factor that's particularly noteworthy, in our last call we made a comment about the end at that point being about 110 to the dollar and of course as of yesterday it was less than 106. So, that's not certainly having helped investment trends, but it certainly will contribute to spending and numbers of visitors from the Far East, from Japan in particular. On the hotel side occupancy continues to strengthen. In the third quarter occupancy levels rose about 500 basis points from about 72 percent to almost 78 percent. In the month of November, which is the most recent available, numbers were up about 300 basis points from about 66 to about 69 percent. And interestingly enough, Oahu generally tends to be the destination for visitors from Japan, and for one of the first months I can recall lately, Oahu led the numbers at about 73 percent occupancy, so there may be some retrend to Japanese group travel which would be of course very beneficial. Average room rates are up about 4 percent, so there's a little less discounting going on. Interestingly enough on air seats, and there's some poor guy who takes the OAG and decomposes this into the numbers of seats, but the nonstop domestic seats rose almost 500,000 or 9 percent to 6 million, and that's a nonstop domestic record for Hawaii. Total seats inbound about 8.6 million, up almost 4 percent versus '02. And the outlook for '04 is that that trend on the domestic side is going to increase up about 14 percent in the first quarter and up a little more than 10 percent in the second. So I assume that airlines make intelligent business decisions and those seat commitments to Hawaii are an indication of the kind of bookings that they're expecting to receive. 7 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

JANUARY 23, 2004 / 4:00PM, - Q4 2003 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Automobiles, which are another measure of consumer demand, were up about 15 percent in the first nine months of '03, and for the full year the forecast is that it will be about a 13 percent rise to about 60,000 new light vehicle sales. And the forecast for '04, which the industry has characterized is conservative, is for about another 2.5 percent, bringing the number of sales for light vehicles to about 62,000. Construction activity continues in the state and it's kind of the icing on the cake as far as Matson's carriage is concerned, because it's a whole cyclical class of cargo. Some of the indicators have leveled off at a fairly high level. For example, the construction tax base in the third quarter edged down about 3 percent, but it still was operating at about a $1.2 billion level, which is not to be sneezed at. And in the same quarter, construction jobs rose 5 percent, and those numbers were up on all of the islands. Residential authorizations as we look forward were up about 6 percent, with single-family in the lead up 22 percent. Multifamily is volatile and it was down about 19. But I think where we're seeing sustained demand, both in strength and selling prices as well as in volume of sales, is in single-family. Oahu, for example, in the most recent data -- in the most recent quarter was up almost 14 percent on selling price to a median of about 393,000. The number of sales were up 25 percent versus the prior year. Lurking or looming in the background is a very substantial series of military housing replacement contracts. The Air Force is going to replace or refurbish 1400 homes, the Army 7700, and the Navy 7300, for a little more than 16,000 homes in total. This is a contract series that will total more than $3 billion. It's in addition to several additions to military units presently assigned to Hawaii, including some cargo aircraft and another destroyer. From the downside military-wise, about 10,000 troops will be deployed from various bases and guard units here in Hawaii to overseas assignments. So there will be some decline in consumer spending in a couple of the communities here on Oahu especially. From an overall viewpoint, the real gross state product projection for '03 has been raised for the third time. It is now estimated at 2.9 percent, and the outlook for '04 is just a shade less at 2.8 percent. Inflation continues to be very low. So I think as I said at the start, we're operating at a very nice sweet spot for an island economy. With that, Tiffany, I think it would be a good time to open for questions from our listeners. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Operator (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS) Diane Daggatt with McAdams Wright Ragen. Diane Daggatt - McAdams Wright Ragen - Analyst I have a question on Matson. Can you talk about the rate environment, and what was the rate increase in '03 and what do you expect it to be in '04? Unidentified Company Representative Jim Andrasick will respond to that question. Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - CFO, President & CEO of Matson Navigation co. It's a good question. In '03, our rates were -- first of all, you have to understand we have a number of different components to rates, which is somewhat different than prior years. We have a terminal handling charge, we have general rate increases, and we have to account for our increases and decreases in our fuel costs through a separate charge as well. So, in combination of all those things, 2003 was very favorable for rates for Matson. It was somewhat of a catch-up period, and average increases were probably 7.5 to 8 percent all-in, including the fuel. In 2004, we have just announced and implemented an annual increase that went into effect on January 11th of this month, which averaged 4.4 percent, depending on how you 8 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

JANUARY 23, 2004 / 4:00PM, - Q4 2003 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call define averages because we have westbound, eastbound and obviously different tariffs for different quantities. But I think it's safe to say that those rates that we think are certainly defensible, certainly reflect various increases in costs and also in service improvements that we are providing to our customers or intend to provide during 2004. I hope that answers the question. Diane Daggatt - McAdams Wright Ragen - Analyst Yes it does, thanks. Operator Dara Edmonds (ph) with Alpine Mutual Funds. Dara Edmonds - Alpine Mutual Funds - Analyst Hi, gentlemen. Maybe for John Kelley or Jim, can you help me match the numbers that you reported to what was on First Call because I'm having a hard time. You reported 44 cents, the mean estimate was 53. But yet Bloomberg put 55 cents down. Can you kind of clarify the numbers for me? John Kelley - Alexander & Baldwin - VP of IR I'll try. I don't subscribe to First Call so we don't have access to those numbers. Dara Edmonds - Alpine Mutual Funds - Analyst Well, the two analysts out there, one was at 49, one was at 56. John Kelley - Alexander & Baldwin - VP of IR As far as I know the McAdams number was 49 for the quarter, and the Caris number was 56. Craig Sirois' Value Line was at 45 cents, and Standard & Poor's was at 54. So I'm not exactly sure --. Dara Edmonds - Alpine Mutual Funds - Analyst Is the number 44 cents, John, or 55 which Bloomberg put on? In other words, are they taking out -- are the analyst taking out some one times that you're putting in the 44 cents? John Kelley - Alexander & Baldwin - VP of IR I'm afraid I don't know what adjustments Bloomberg is making to our numbers. Dara Edmonds - Alpine Mutual Funds - Analyst It's very confusing, I have to tell you. But the 44 cents that you reported that was at with some of these pensions? Is that an all in number? 9 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

JANUARY 23, 2004 / 4:00PM, - Q4 2003 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call John Kelley - Alexander & Baldwin - VP of IR It is an all in number. Dara Edmonds - Alpine Mutual Funds - Analyst Okay. So some of those one times might be taken out. And then on the guidance for next year, I know you said the pace won't be as high as the '03 which is kind of a rebound year. But again, can you give us some idea? It sounds like the Hawaiian economy is doing just great, yet Matson's going to be down, leasing and food are flat, and the sales part of it is pretty tough to forecast, and logistics is pretty small. So can you kind of give us a sense of what the '04 year-over-year percentage gain (indiscernible) double-digits, can you just give us some idea? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO We don't forecast our future earnings. What we'll give you and we have given you some qualitative guidance, we expect that we will have what we're calling sustainable growth next year. I believe that Matson will, if you start off from a base in the mid to high 80s, Matson is going to have a good year in 2004. Certainly our overall property segment, when you put leasing and sales together, is going to have also a very good year. We expect food products to be flat. So overall I feel that -- it's hard when you have a rebound year where you've had 37 percent to disappoint people when you're going to have something that's going to be a lot smaller than that. But for us it's certainly encouraging because we're seeing with the economy, the state, and the strong performance of our two core groups, we're feeling good about the year, but it's not going to be -- be a huge overall increase in earnings. Dara Edmonds - Alpine Mutual Funds - Analyst And you won't tell us if you think you're going to hit double-digit or not? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO I'm not going to give a specific number. Dara Edmonds - Alpine Mutual Funds - Analyst Thank you very much. Operator Nicholas Aberle with Caris & Company. Nicholas Aberle - Caris & Company - Analyst Good morning, gentlemen. Just going back to the Matson operating profit real quick and the onetime events that you referred to earlier in the call. The 6 million in nonoperating expenses, Allen, can you give a little bit more detail into what those expenses were? 10 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

JANUARY 23, 2004 / 4:00PM, - Q4 2003 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO Yes, we had a onetime nonqualified pension expense of about $3.5 million, that would be characterized clearly as an unusual item. In addition to that, and this goes a little bit back in terms of history, but when we started the year we indicated that we were going to be absorbing about 25 cents a share of increased pension expense. And the majority of that went to Matson and we put it through the income statement, essentially about $10 million, about $2.5 million a quarter. So we took the $2.5 million for that fourth-quarter, added it to the 3.5 million of the nonqual (ph) pension expense, and those two items totaled 6 million. And then we sort of removed that from our ongoing running rate and then of course also removed the impacts of that 16.7 million of a onetime curtailment gain. So it's a little bit confusing but it does suggest that the running rate of Matson is in mid high $80 million range rather than say 93 million. Nicholas Aberle - Caris & Company - Analyst Adjusting for the onetime events I'm getting a margin for the ocean transportation business of about 10.89 percent, which is still slightly down incrementally from Q2 and Q3 of this year. Is that just a seasonal affect or is it just topping off there? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO That's a good question. The rate in the fourth-quarter when you take these adjustment is about 11 percent. A range of 10 to 12 percent is probably a reasonable. We have -- the third quarter is the best, the first quarter is the lowest quarter, and then be second and the fourth-quarter are sort of in between, so the margins will vary. You can pretty well be assured that our first quarter margins will be lower than the rest of the year for 2004, and that we'll get better as we get into the second and the third-quarter. So no, from an operating standpoint, and obviously we're looking at lots and lots of information here, we had a good operating quarter in the fourth-quarter. But it was better of a -- what I would call a normal pattern absent the fleet reconfiguration and several of these onetimers that have been enumerated. Nicholas Aberle - Caris & Company - Analyst So we can look for Q1 ocean transportation margins to be at the lower end of the 10 to 12 percent range? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO Yes. Nicholas Aberle - Caris & Company - Analyst Jim, can you talk a bit about or give us some commentary with respect to the initial customer response and cost implications of the new carriage (indiscernible) automobile service, roll on/roll off? Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - CFO, President & CEO of Matson Navigation co. Certainly, Nicholas. I think they've been -- the customer response, and I'll just deal with I guess big three auto manufacturers, US-based has been very good to the overall program that we've announced. And we had really just started to implement segments of this, the biggest initial chunk was the charter end of the roro vessel that John mentioned. We've also established dedicated auto terminals both in Honolulu and in Oakland 11 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

JANUARY 23, 2004 / 4:00PM, - Q4 2003 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call which is a change for the company, we've never done that before. And we are embarking on a massive redo of our information systems as it relates to autos and how they're tracked for our customers. In every case these initiatives really have been customer driven. I would have to say that we are not done yet by any stretch, we have further improvements to make. And despite what we've described as very good operational metrics for Matson during the fourth-quarter, we did have some hiccups. The weather this time of year has been very choppy, there have been some other labor issues, productivity issues in Hawaii. But overall, I think the new auto and vehicle carriage program is being well accepted. But I would just repeat that we have more to do, and we plan to do more as the year 2004 progresses. Nicholas Aberle - Caris & Company - Analyst Sounds good. And lastly, I think investors have been in general anticipating some type of dividend increase this year. Allen, can you give us a little color as to potential timing or potential amount of increase the dividend could sustain? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO Yes. I'm not in the position to really say too much about that. This is the province of our Board of Directors. I can tell you that we are going to be looking at our dividends in a very thorough manner and actually are now. And we'll be determining and making an evaluation which will be given to the Board of Directors later on this year. And we'll see what the result is. Clearly -- we met with a number of investors several months ago. The question that was asked at about every meeting was what do you think about dividends? I have to tell you, there were a number of different responses that we got. There are cross current working many different ways. The one thing I got that came out of the meetings was don't spend your money stupidly whatever you do. Give it back to us in repurchases to make good investments in the company, increase your dividend but don't do anything stupid. But in terms of the dividend results, we got lots of different views. But frankly, with the changes in tax treatment and the improving prospects for the company, it's time for a periodic re-evaluation of the rate. Nicholas Aberle - Caris & Company - Analyst So if it did go through, when would be the earliest time it would be implemented? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO I can't comment on that. Nicholas Aberle - Caris & Company - Analyst Fair enough. Thank you, guys. Operator (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS) Rob Maten with Schneider Capital. Rob Maten - Schneider Capital - Analyst I just had a couple questions on the Wailea development that you talked a little about. The one parcel where you're selling lots, how much of the overall 270 acres does that parcel represent? 12 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

JANUARY 23, 2004 / 4:00PM, - Q4 2003 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO It represents, let me see if I have my -- I'm going to find it here but you can extrapolate this one parcel and multiplied it by 17. I can tell you that right now. I think it has about 14 acres in it. I might be a little wrong there in terms of the acreage, but I believe it's about 14 acres or so. They're half acre lots, they're 29 so 14, 15 acres, out of 270. Rob Maten - Schneider Capital - Analyst That's pretty close to the average then. Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO Yes, it is. Rob Maten - Schneider Capital - Analyst And is that parcel, in terms of the desirability of the location or views or that kind of thing, fairly similar to the other parcels or is there any other differences? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO The one difference, it's single-family -- it's single-family zoned, many of the other parcels are multi family. That's one difference. In terms of its overall view plane, it's slightly better than average but I'd characterize it more as an average location rather than one of the best or poorest. Rob Maten - Schneider Capital - Analyst Great, thanks a lot. Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO You're welcome. Operator There are no further questions in queue, Mr. Kelley. John Kelley - Alexander & Baldwin - VP of IR Okay. We would like to think everyone for participating. And if there are additional questions, we can take them off-line. We appreciate your participation. And aloha. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our conference for today. Thank you all for participating and have a nice day.

Earnings Conference Call Before we go into the details of the fourth quarter and the year, of which I'm going to ask Charlie Brown, our EVP and CFO, to do, I'd just like to make a few comments about 2003 in total. Certainly, disappointing North American retail comp growth has and continues to overshadow the other major accomplishments and achievements we did in 2003. I'd like to just talk for a moment about a few of those. Our acquisition of Guilbert and the integration results to date are meeting or exceeding virtually all of our expectations. The continued outstanding performance of our European operations pre-Guilbert is remarkable, and we've had sizable reductions in Japan's operating losses. We grew and expanded our global leadership position in e-commerce. We accelerated our growth rates in our North America large account customer base. We redeployed and repositioned our North American contract sales force, which will lead to accelerated growth rates in 2004. We had our third consecutive year of North American warehouse efficiency, productivity and quality growth. We created and successfully executed a chain-wide rollout of Ink(indiscernible) Depot. During the fourth quarter, we implemented significant changes in furniture and technology assortments in our North American retail stores. We successfully launched Business Furniture Gallery and implemented more than 300 stores across our chain. We launched Christopher Lowell, a line of furniture and desk accessory collections that are exclusive to Office Depot. That line is exceeding expectations and we will expand that line to more stores in the first quarter this year. We dramatically expanded our North American retail assortments of laptops and desktops and comps are now trending positive in these categories in our North American stores. We launched Magellan, the largest business project in Office Depot's history, which will lead to improved sales, margins, comps and supply-chain (indiscernible) performance. And we are nine months into a 31-month project on time, on budget, with everything meeting our expectations. We began the roll-out of our Millennium remodel format in North America retail. Twenty-three stores are completed or are under construction. We strengthened our executive leadership in our North American delivery and our North American supply-chain organizations with the appointment of two seasoned veterans from within Office Depot. We have a strong, short list of candidates, both for the North American merchant positions and the North American president position. So, in summary, we accomplished a great deal. Clearly, the focus is on North American retail comps and our look forward into 2004. Charlie will now take you through 2003 and then I will wrap-up and we will give you a chance to ask us questions. Our focus is on looking forward. We are optimistic about our opportunities. We will share more of that optimism with you later in the call. Charlie? Charles Brown - Office Depot - CFO Thanks, Bruce. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to start with an overview of total Company performance, comment on performance in our three business segments and -- close with our outlook for 2004 total company sales were up 14 percent in the  fourth quarter and -- 9 percent for the full year comparable worldwide sales down 2 percent for the quarter  and for 2003 Worldwide e-commerce was up 31% for the quarter, and up 25% for the year  reaching an industry leading 2.6 billion dollars. Our fourth quarter operating profit performance reflects strong European results bolstered with favorable currency rates, the addition of Guilbert operations for the full quarter, and continued growth in our large customer segment in North America, offset by negative comparable sales and operating expense de-leverage in our North American Retail business. Net earnings for the quarter on a GAAP basis were $45.8 million, or 15 cents per share. Included in fourth-quarter net income were charges of 32.4 million, or 7 cents per share  composed of 23.9 million lease termination costs related to stores closed in prior period, and 8.4 million account for the sale or write-down  of pre-2000 investments in certain Internet based  companies. In our third quarter, we noted a potential exposure relating to closing a warehouse in the UK. However, as for a detailed review of the property and our related insurance claim, we have determined that we do not have an exposure  at this time. Excluding the above amounts, EPS on a non-GAAP basis was 22 cents for the fourth quarter, compared to 23 cents in 2002. 3 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Also included in our results for the fourth quarter was a 3 cent negative impact from the application of EITF 02-16  which became effective for 2003. Net earnings for the full-year 2003 were 276.3 million, or 88 cents per share, included in net income, the charges of 32.4 million, or 8 cents per share which I detailed earlier. There was also a charge of 8 cents per share for the cumulative effect of adopting EITF. Excluding the above, our non-GAAP EPS for the full year was $1.04 compared to $1.02  last year. Now, let's turn to the individual segment results. Fourth-quarter international sales grew 99 percent in U.S. dollars and 84 percent  local currencies, foreign currency translation benefited reported sales by 68 million. For the full year, international sales grew 67 percent in U.S. dollars and 52 percent in local currencies. Foreign currency translation benefited reported sales by $253 million. European sales continue to be the main growth vehicle for Office Depot International with solid performance across all of our operations except Germany and Japan, where we have experienced continued soft sales trends. Before moving to a discussion of gross profit and segment operating profit, I'd like to point out that all of my comments from this point forward are excluding the impact of adopting EITF 02-16. This allows comparability between our 2003 and 2002 income statements. During the fourth quarter, International gross profit was down 175 basis points, largely the result of a higher mix of contract business. However, strong cost controls across our operations contributed to a 413 basis point drop in operating and selling expenses. As a result, segment operating profit in the quarter rose 141 percent in U.S. dollars and 123 percent in local currencies. In the quarter, foreign currency translation contributed $10 million to segment operating profit, largely offset by the translation impact from our international G&A spending. The net benefit to EPS from foreign currency translation in the quarter was less than 1 cent per share. For the full year, International segment operating profit increased 75 percent in U.S. dollars 59 percent in local currencies, and our operating margin improved by 58 basis points to 13.5 percent of sales. Foreign currency translation positively impacted full-year segment operating results by $33 million. After considering the impact of International G&A, the full-year translation benefit was about 3 cents per share. Guilbert was a major strategic investment for us in 2003. We are pleased to report that we achieved the 2003 synergies we announced last July and we are on track to achieve our targets for 2004. The integration process is moving smoothly. Our leadership structure is in place in all countries and doing well. At this point, we've captured the purchasing synergies we expected and we are making good progress in make rationalizing the combined infrastructure costs. Turning to our North American Delivery Group's results, total sales were flat for the fourth quarter and up 1 percent for the full-year. Our contract Channel grew 3 percent for the quarter and 4 percent for the full year, reflecting continued growth in our large customer segment. Sales increased in most markets, including our West region, where we experienced some softness last year amidst California's fiscal issues. Our average order value increased 3 percent for the quarter and full year, and customer retention was up 114 basis points. Our domestic e-commerce business delivered a solid performance, posting an 11 percent increase for the fourth quarter and 15 percent for the full year. Our total worldwide e-commerce business now exceeds $2.6 billion, making us the largest online office products dealer in the world and one of the largest etailers behind Amazon.com. However, we continue to focus a great deal of our efforts on our commercial catalog businesses. Both the Viking and Office Depot catalogs have underperform our sales expectation. As most of you know, we consolidated the operations of these two businesses in 2003, which cost us approximately 2 cents per share this year. However, with this consolidation behind us, we expect to gain greater momentum and synergy as we move through 2004. Total BSG gross margins were down slightly, reflecting the higher mix of larger national accounts, offset by improvements in the Company's catalog merchandising efforts and continued disciplined pricing. Over the last three years, we've demonstrated our ability to continuously reduce our 4 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call warehouse and delivery costs while improving our customer service indices. As a result, BSG segment operating profit increased almost 160 basis points in the quarter, achieving a 10.7 percent operating margin. For the year, North American BSG operating margin reached 9.6 percent, up 40 basis points over last year, again reflecting strong productivity gains and cost controls in our North American warehouse system. Finally, our North American retail business -- retail sales were 1.4 billion in the quarter and 5.7 billion for the full-year. Our comparable sales declined 4 percent for both the quarter and full year. While comparable transactions were ["up 1%" - Misstatement amended by ODP on 2/11/04 to: "down almost 3%"] percent for the quarter, average transaction value declined ["3%"- Misstatement amended by ODP on 2/11/04 to state: "2%"] percent in the period. By category, total office supplies were flat in the quarter, while furniture and technology comped negatively. Technology was driven, in large part, by a 60 percent decline in desktops, laptops and monitors. For the full year, total office supplies were up 1 percent and machine supplies, which includes ink and toner, were up 4 percent. Furniture for the full year was down 5 percent and technology declined 11 percent, again driven mostly by the 22 percent decline in desktops, laptops and monitors. In real estate, we opened 22 new stores in the quarter, closed one, relocated five stores. In addition, we opened seven new military stores. Therefore, at the end of the year, there were 900 Office Depot stores in the U.S. and Canada. We also completed or began work on 14 Millennium remodels in the quarter and have begun nine more in 2004. Over the past several months, we have focused aggressively on the right design and cost elements to ensure an improved shopping experience and an appropriate return on our remodel investment. At this point, we are comfortable that we are on the right track and expect to complete 50 to 60 additional remodels in 2004. Gross margins declined 20 basis points for the quarter and 110 basis points for the full year, reflecting higher clearance activity related to new merchandising initiatives and higher promotional activity during the holiday period. We also experienced somewhat higher shrink expense in connection with rolling out to Ink Depot. However, we've implemented appropriate theft deterrent technologies to mitigate the exposure, going forward. Operating and selling costs increased almost 150 basis points in the quarter and 50 basis points for the full year, reflecting some deleverage from softer sales and higher benefit costs for our employees. The net result is a segment operating profit decline in North American retail of $26 million, or 168 basis points, in the fourth quarter and $109 million, or 172 basis points, for the full year. I would like now to share some of our balance sheet metrics and cash flow metrics for the Company. Our total cash and short-term investments totaled $891 million at the end of the fourth quarter. The inventory levels were slightly up from last year to 1.34 billion before the addition of Guilbert. Without Guilbert, inventories were actually down about 60 million after adding 47 new stores net on a global basis. From a working capital perspective, our contract Channel DSO was 45 days in the fourth quarter and 44 days for the full year, down from 47 days in 2002. Finally, cash flow from operations was 162 million in the fourth quarter with capital expenditures totaling 67 million, or free cash flow of 95 million for the period. For the full year, cash flow from operations rose to 652 million with 212 million in capital spending. As a result, free cash flow was 440 million for 2003. As we look out into 2004, we will begin reporting our segment operating profit differently to help you better understand our performance across each of our business segments. Our general and administrative costs consist primarily of personnel and infrastructure-related costs associated with support functions. Because these functions typically support all segments of our business, we have not historically considered these costs in determining our segment operating profitability. However, over the past few years, we have invested heavily in developing our international segments and with the recent acquisition 5 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call of Guilbert, our general and administrative costs are disproportionately weighted towards our International segment when compared to our domestic business. Therefore, beginning in 2004, we plan to reclassify certain amounts previously classified as G&A into operating and selling expense. We also plan to allocate costs where appropriate to determine segment profitability. Of course, we will post pro forma financial statements for 2003 on our investor Web site to assist with this transition. At this point, I'd like to share our outlook for 2004. We expected to grow our worldwide revenues in excess of 10 percent with EPS growth at 15 to 20 percent, or about $1.20 to $1.25 per share in 2004, compared the $1.04 in 2003. For the first quarter, we expect EPS growth in the 8 to 10 percent range, compared to last year's 32 cents from continuing operations. Some of the key assumptions underlying our outlook include our North American retail total sales growth of 6 to 8 percent, positive comparable sales in every quarter with sequential acceleration. Gross margins are somewhat higher than 2003, excluding product mix changes -- 70 to 80 new store openings and 50 to 60 (inaudible) remodels. BSG -- sales growth in the mid to high-single digit range with contract Channel growing faster than catalog, slightly lower gross margin rates as a result of the higher growth in large customer accounts, continued improvement in our warehouse and delivery cost as a percentage of sales. For International, sales growth in the low to mid single digit range in local currency, stable gross margins except for the full-year mix impact of adding the lower margin contract business acquired with Guilbert, and of course, achieving the planned synergies from Guilbert. Finally, our key balance sheet assumptions include CapEx in the 300 to 325 million range, flat inventory levels despite adding 70 to 80 new stores in North America, and free cash flow generation of 400 to $450 million. With that, I'd like to turn it back to Bruce. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, CEO Thanks, Charlie. Before we turn the call over to all of you for questions, I'd like to summarize a few things. First, our three-year accomplishments, which I will review here in a minute, now position us for an acceleration in EPS growth as our North American retail business begins to rebound. In the last three years, our North American BSG segment operating income, on a pro forma basis, has more than doubled from 192 million in 2000 to 388 million in 2003 and has gone from 24 percent of our Company's segment income to 36, a remarkable achievement. Our International segment operating income, on a pro forma basis, has gone from 175 million in 2000 to 371 million in 2003, a 112 percent increase, and from 22 percent of our company to 35 percent of our company. Our industry-leading worldwide e-commerce sales have grown from 982 million to 2.6 billion and from 8.5 percent of our company's revenue to 21 percent of our company's revenue in 2003. Applying the 2000 North America BSG warehouse operating expense ratio to the 2003 sales resulted in $85 million of savings in our North American warehouses and at the same time, virtually all of our quality measurements reached all-time highs. In three years, we've generated more than $2 billion of operating cash flow we've used to invest and strategically reposition the Company and build a solid foundation for growth. We've made investments in warehouse technology and systems that have driven efficiency, lowered cost and increased quality. We have opened new countries and new channels in existing countries. We acquired Guilbert and 4Sure.com from our cash. We've utilized the intranet to drive out inefficiency, lower costs, increase quality and the quantity of our management information. We've invested in ERP systems. PeopleSoft financial and HR systems and the beginning investments in Magellan, our merchandising, planning, assortment and replenishing system that will increase sales, margins and inventory turns in our North American channels. 6 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call We have tested and opened new retail (indiscernible) formats. From Lantana to Millennium, we have learned, tested and rolled out. We've found a way to lower the square foot requirements in an existing North American store by 20 to 25 percent without negatively impacting store growth. We've opened stores in Stop-n-Shop at Albertson's; we've opened Office Depot stores on military bases. With the North American stores we closed in the early part of 2001 and to date our intentional slowing of new store openings over the past three years, we have only increased our net North American retail store count by 12 stores in the past three years. That has been a significant contributor to slowing North American retail sales growth and comps, as new stores add both growth and comp significantly better than older stores. But while we still have significant opportunities to even have more effective merchandising and marketing programs, we are beginning to see the first very encouraging signs of positive North American retail comps. That adds to our confidence that our plans to accelerate the opening of new, smaller stores in North America, from a net 33 stores in 2003 to 75 to 80 stores in 2004 and to 295 to 100 stores in 2005, will pay big dividends in the future for North American retail growth and profitability, building off the solid foundations we have in our BSG and International business. In summary, with what we believe is the beginning of our North American retail store comp turning consistently positive, we are in a position to accelerate EPS growth and shareholder value in 2004 and beyond. We have a cash-rich balance sheet; we will use that cash to invest or growth the business and/or grow shareholder value. We have a worldwide, unwavering focus on seven key strategies with clear goals, objectives, accountability and plans. Our 2004 outlook is optimistic, and we believe we've never been in a more solid position to leverage our multibrand, multichannel, multi (indiscernible) organization that we've built over the past three years to new performance levels. Thanks for taking the time to listen to us. We will now turn the call over to you for questions. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Operator Thank you. (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). Bill Sims of Smith Barney. Bill Sims - Salomon Smith Barney - Analyst Good morning, thank you. Based on your first-quarter retail comp guidance, it would appear that, on a two year comp basis, comps are only expected to see a mild improvement versus the stronger suggestion in the release. Are we going to have to see a stronger business spending recovery before many of your initiatives begin to drive higher comps? In line with that question, in your 2004 guidance, does that factor in any business spending recovery, or is that a base case scenario until we see upside from there? Thank you. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, CEO Based on the early results in the first quarter, which we're early into, we are very encouraged. Our outlook for comps in North America are predominantly based on what we've done, particularly in the fourth quarter and frankly all of last year to position us. We're starting to see the early benefits of that, and our comp guidance assumes that those are our impacts, what we are able to drive, and not necessarily any huge lift in the economy. 7 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Bill Sims - Salomon Smith Barney - Analyst Just a quick follow-up on the Millennium remodels -- can you give us any guidance in terms of how the Millennium formats are doing relative to your current (indiscernible)? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, CEO We're encouraged by what we've seen so far. As Charlie pointed out, either under construction or open, we have about 23 stores. We are already finding opportunities to improve on the existing models. We will incorporate those improvements in the last eight stores that we roll out this quarter. We took those stores early on and made them what we call waves. Each wave has been better-executed; it has had a lower cost to it. We believe we've now found some opportunities to even make the Millennium format we have even better, and we plan our last eight stores of this wave to include those changes. Operator Danielle Fox of JP Morgan. Danielle Fox - J.P. Morgan Chase - Analyst Good morning. I actually have a couple of questions about the North American retail sales rebound in January and just the outlook for the '04 quarters. First, I am wondering if you could talk about what you think was the catalyst for the improvement in January. Because when I look at the model, it looks like comparisons (inaudible) used pretty significantly. Was there something that actually changed, in your view, in underlying demand? If so, what do you think drove it? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, CEO Thanks, Danielle. First of all, I think we have talked a great deal about the changes we've made. I know all of you have commented while we've talked about those changes, they haven't seemed to show up in comps. These are not changes that we made starting the first of January. We said we were going to change the assortment in technology in the fourth quarter, and we did. We said we would see lift in furniture through our business furniture gallery and our rollout and the launch of Christopher Lowell, and we did. We started to see those signs shortly after the beginning of the year. When business went back to work the full week after New Year's, we started to see an acceleration in our comps. We have said all along for the past three years, our comp challenges have predominantly been in furniture and technology. We continue to believe that's the case. As it relates to our optimism, all of you know we comped negative 16 straight quarters. Whether we have not easy comparisons is not our focus; our focus is doing the right things in execution, in furniture and technology and supplies and other steps and actions that we've taken and will take that we believe are beginning to show the first signs of a rebound. Danielle Fox - J.P. Morgan Chase - Analyst Just a couple of follow-up questions on that -- I guess I'm still trying to put the guidance in the context of the two-year comp rate -- or do you think that maybe these comparisons are not that important? Because I'm trying to figure out how comps accelerate when the comparison goes from negative 7 to negative 2 to 3. It seems to imply that underlying sales trends need to accelerate further. Then I have just one final quick question. 8 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, CEO Danielle, I can just state we are encouraged by the first six or seven weeks of this quarter. We are seeing positive trends; that's what we've put into our outlook for 2004. We said we will comp positive in retail this quarter, and we will. We will accelerate our comps throughout the year, and we believe that to be how it will work out. We have made many changes; we've got more to go. We are starting to see the first signs of those changes. Danielle Fox - J.P. Morgan Chase - Analyst (technical difficulty) -- others a chance to ask questions. Operator Dan Binder of Buckingham Research. Dan Binder - Buckingham Research - Analyst Good morning. A couple questions for you -- first, it looks like your remodels for next year are going to be in the 50 to 60 range. I think, at one point, you were thinking 75 to 100. I'm just curious why the reduction. Secondly, if you can give us an update on the cost to do it, the remodel time to do it, the disruption and so forth. That's my first question. My second question has to do with what you can tell us about the reorganization of the contract sales force that you think will help you out in '04. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, CEO Well, your first question is the guidance we've given relative to how many Millenniums. I alluded to the fact that the first Millenniums we were encouraged by the results but we also said these were tests; we never said they were other than to make sure we could execute successfully our remodel program, that we could provide the customers the kind of service we wanted to provide and use our supply-chain to the advantage we thought we could use it. We've seen some opportunities to make format changes in Millennium in the remaining eight stores we have not yet started -- eight out of the first 31. We're going to delay those a bit, maybe a week, maybe a month, so that we can incorporate the changes we will put into those eight. As a result of that, we're just now saying we're being a little more conservative on our view about how many of those that we can execute. Provided they go well and everything happens positively, we could accelerate that, but we're trying to give a more accurate picture of what it looks like at the moment. Second, for each wave we've done, we've taken costs out of the model. We said we thought these Millenniums would come in at around 375 to 400,000 each. The first ones came in more than that; the second wave has come in under that. We feel confident we can bring these in 350 to 400. Our disruption time from the first eight to the second eight has been decreased; our disruption to the customer has been decreased and we've gotten better at doing these -- all why you do tests. So, that's our outlook for Millennium. As I said, we could clearly accelerate that later in the year as we see the changes in the format we will make in what we now call Millennium 2.0. As it relates to the reorganization and redeployment of our sales force, I said in my earlier comments that our changes we made in our organization, in our North American delivery business and our supply-chain are significant. Through that leadership change, we've aligned our sales force, we think, to take better advantage of their skills and abilities, in terms of focusing their efforts on the kinds of things we want them to focus on. We've changed the way we compensate them and that doesn't mean less compensation; frankly, it gives most of them increased opportunities for compensation. We believe they'll be better focused; they will drive new account more; they will drive penetration to existing accounts. Our sales 9 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call force is optimistic about this. We've talked to them all; I've spoken to the combined sales forces at Office Depot over the last couple of months, and I'm convinced it's going to drive revenue growth in our BSG segment. Our growth in BSG in the large customer segment in 2003 was admirable. We believe we gained share. We think we will gain share in 2004. Our struggle for growth has been in the smaller and medium-sized accounts of our both catalog business and BSG. We believe the changes we have made there will improve and frankly, I think we've a stronger catalog management organization today than we had three or four months ago as well. I'm optimistic and confident about our ability to drive revenue in BSG. Dan Binder - Buckingham Research - Analyst Just one last question -- with regards to the technology comps in North American retail, they have been down for several quarters. Could you first discuss what you've done in technology merchandising that you think will help? I saw you launched the Gateway Notebooks; they seem to be going okay. Can you discuss any other changes? Just as a follow-on to that, given the space allocation that you have in the store and the severely negative comps, do you think you need to rethink that allocation of space? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, CEO The first answer to your question is that we have significantly expanded the assortment in retail that began in the fourth quarter, and that has carried into the first quarter of both notebooks and laptops, and both of those have driven sales. We made some significant changes in our ability to configure to order for our customers. We developed our own internal Web site to do that; it's faster; it's efficient. CTO sales have growth accordingly as well. As it relates to space allocation, we've not made any changes to date in technology in North American retail from a space allocation perspective. We plan on technology space allocation, assortment and plan-o-gram changes that will begin in the first quarter late and take us into the second that we think will drive even better technologies sales. Our list so far has come predominantly from assortments. We've not done much in the store in terms of where we put it, how we laid it out, what we put next to it, adjacencies (inaudible) market basket. We will begin to make some of those physical changes in stores later this quarter and throughout the second quarter that we think will even lead to greater growth in this key category. I want to remind you, small businesses, over the past three years, have under-invested in their use of technology called laptops, desktops, monitors and printers. Our core business model in that category is aimed at the small business. We think we can drive share and growth in those categories. Operator Michael Baker of Deutsche Bank. Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank Alex Brown - Analyst A couple of questions -- I guess first, within the earnings expectations, it does I think imply a big acceleration in earnings in the second half of year. Is that just primarily due to your expectations that comps get better in the second half of the year, or is there something else on the margin line that helps that? 10 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, CEO I think the primary driver of the second half of the year is improvement in comps; retail comps has a significant impact. But we also see a growing improvement in our North American delivery business. We also see the benefits coming from the full integration of Guilbert into our European operations and what we believe is accelerated growth into some parts of Europe. So, it's a combination of a variety of things. So, clearly the biggest, single factor for a more robust look at the second half would be North American retail comps. Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank Alex Brown - Analyst Thanks. Finally, I guess related, within that, is there any benefit assumed from the further rollout of the Christopher Lowell line? Can you discuss how many stores that is in right now and how many it will be in '04 -- just some more details on the initial reaction? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, CEO I said the initial reaction is that the initial launch of the furniture and the accessories exceeds our expectations. The entire accessory line is virtually in all stores. There are selected furniture vignettes of Christopher Lowell in some stores. By the middle part of the second quarter, late second quarter, we will have at least one Christopher Lowell vignette in virtually all of our stores and we will increase the number of stores that have the full collection but for competitive reasons, I'm not going to tell you what the numbers are at this point. Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank Alex Brown - Analyst One last quick question, if I could? (technical difficulty) -- retail gross margin will be up a bit before the mix shift. Can you discuss what the potential negative impact of the mix shift, which I assume is the more technology, might have on your retail gross margin? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, CEO I'll let Charlie give insight to that but for the base business, we think there's a slight uptick in margins in retail for the full-year 2004. As technology grows, which is a lower margin, it could mix the business down a bit, but I don't see huge risks in this category. Charlie, do you have a comment on the magnitude it could be? Charles Brown - Office Depot - CFO No, I don't see huge risk either. As I mentioned in my comments, last year in retail, we experienced some increase in shrink, which impacts our gross margins, so we've taken an action to improve that. We also had some clearance and promotional activity throughout the year as we revamped our furniture offering. Again, we expect to anniversary that. So I think the risk is minimal and I think, actually, we have more upside. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, CEO Frankly, our outlook takes that into consideration. The outlook we provide for North American comp growth (inaudible) margins takes into what we believe will be the mix impact on margins, so we put that into our overall forecast of positive retail comps every quarter, accelerating quarter-by-quarter. We feel confident, at this point, based on the early results we're seeing, we don't believe one-time anomalies, that we will do what we said we would do -- comp positive on retail in the first quarter and each quarter gets successfully better at it.

Earnings Conference Call Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Analyst Good morning. First, a quick follow-up question on Dan's question -- can you refresh us or remind us on the tech comps through last year? I think they deteriorated. So, when you begin to anniversary some easier comps in the tech category? Secondly, if you could just give us a quick update on what you're seeing in the catalog business in terms of the competitive environment, the demand situation and maybe a little bit more insight into what you've changed there that gives you some optimism of improving sales trends there? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, CEO We will get the question on the comps and technology, but we basically have comped negative all year, and I don't think the rate was much different throughout the quarters, so I think throughout the year, we're going to face comparatively negative (indiscernible) technology comps all four quarters. We were negative in the fourth quarter in technology, so I think it's about the same but we will get to that in a second. Second, as it relates to the competitive environment in the catalog business, I think the competitive environment in the small and medium account business is more where you ought to look at. I think all of us in the business have tried to grow more solidly in this small and medium segment. A catalog is just one way you reach that segment. You reach it through e-commerce and you reach it in some cases through the lower end of our BSG sales force, which I told you we've taken some actions which I think will change that. We are still experiencing, this quarter, negative growth in the catalog business overall, but we believe that will begin to accelerate throughout the year. The organization I'm speaking to is that I think our biggest challenge has always been -- but our greatest strength is multichannel, multibrand. I now believe, for the first time in some time, we have clearly aligned goals, measurements, compensation systems, analysis and focus on gaining share of the customers' wallet, no matter from which channel it comes. We have spent a good part of the year focusing on that; the management changes we've made in that business reinforce that. You can tell that if you're inside Office Depot; you can't quite see it in numbers yet. Trust me, you will. Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Analyst Just one follow-up for Charlie -- what's the 13.8 million in other operating expenses and the 4 million negative of miscellaneous income on the P&L? Are those the charges? Charles Brown - Office Depot - CFO Yes, that's where we put the Internet write-downs. Operator Philippe Grossen of Credit Suisse First Boston. Philippe Grossen - Credit Suisse First Boston - Analyst Good morning, gentlemen. (inaudible) fixed income here at CSFB. Two questions, if I may, this morning. The first one was, could you perhaps give us a little bit more color in terms of your allocation of free cash flow and how all of that fits in with your commitment to your current credit ratings? 12 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, CEO Sure. (LAUGHTER). Glad to do it. I said earlier, we have a nice quality problem; we've had it for the better part of the year. We have a cash rich balance sheet! Our free cash flow in 2003 I think was admirable, particularly considering the challenges we had in North American retail. We finished in the $4.25, 4.50 range in 2003, which is the range we are forecasting for 2004. Our CapEx assumptions for 2004 are for more CapEx than we had in 2003 -- in the neighborhood of 100 million more -- as we invest in the Millennium remodels and accelerate the opening of North American stores. We still will generate substantial cash flow. My preference, I've said all along, is to use that cash to grow our business. That's what we did when we acquired Guilbert and that's going to turn out to be an enormously successful acquisition and integration. That's what we did when we acquired a company called 4Sure. But frankly, if we can't find uses of that cash to invest that will grow (indiscernible), grow revenue, grow profitability, then we have an obligation to return that cash to shareholders. We have said that consistently. We have a board that focuses on that and that's about as much 'color' as I can give you at this point on how we would use the cash and allocate it. Philippe Grossen - Credit Suisse First Boston - Analyst But you definitely do remain committed to your current low triple-B rating? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, CEO Yes, that's a good point. I'm sorry I didn't emphasize that. Yes. We have been consistently committed to having investment-grade credit or higher. That's a philosophy that both the Board and the key leaders of this company strongly endorse. That's been how we've approached our balance sheet, financing, debt, CapEx and uses of cash, and that's how we continue to focus. Philippe Grossen - Credit Suisse First Boston - Analyst If I can just drill down a little bit deeper on that, right now, you are low triple-B. Are you comfortable with that, or do you think you should go to a higher rating? Because that's kind of important for my (indiscernible) investors as well to see if there is perhaps upside here or you feel very comfortable with the financial flexibility that you get as a low triple-B company? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, CEO I think the credit ratings have their own way to approach the business. I think, if you look at the pure metrics of the business, just the metrics, the balance sheet, the liquidity ratios, the debt-to-capital ratio, the improvement in the operating cash flow and how we've used it, it would be hard not to argue that we should have a higher rating. I think the credit rating agencies have been cautious of our overall U.S. economic environment and particularly cautious about North American retail comps and their impact on the Company. I'm hopeful that with a more positive outlook on North American comps and obviously some consistent quarters of demonstrating that what we say we can do, that the credit agencies would look favorably towards us and would give us the opportunity to have a higher credit rating than the one we currently enjoy. Philippe Grossen - Credit Suisse First Boston - Analyst Wonderful. My final question -- have you seen any changes in terms of OfficeMax in those markets where you complete following the acquisition by Boise? 13 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, CEO The answer is no, I don't think so. I think the Max/Boise transaction wasn't completed until year-end. Frankly, in retail, if you look at advertising inserts and marketing, the leadtime I know is such that my assumption is what happened in January with OfficeMax, most of that was pretty much baked prior to the merger. We are looking now towards the impact of OfficeMax store closings; it's our belief, based on what they have said and we've said, that we will start to see those now probably late this month, early into March. We would expect the early impact of those closings -- and I might add, by the way, I think most of you know this -- we have the greatest competitive overlap to OfficeMax as anybody. We have about 80 percent of Office Depot stores in North America that have an OfficeMax within three to five miles. So, we think their store closings, for a very brief period of time as they liquidate those inventories, could have a slight negative impact on our own growth in comps, but we also believe that once those stores close, that we will stand as the biggest benefactor of the closing Max stores because of our competitive overlap. So we will see what happens with that but I think it's too early, from our perspective, to see any real competitive environment change yet with that merger. Operator Jeff Black of Lehman Brothers. Jeff Black - Lehman Brothers - Analyst Good morning, guys. Let's talk about International for a minute. What's is the long-term -- how do you think about, I guess, the long-term growth of this business? In terms of revenues, are we higher than U.S.? Are we lower than U.S.? Really, what do you see for next year developing, now that you've got the acquisition cycled in? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, CEO I think we've said all along one of the reasons this company was the first in our sector to establish a strong base in Europe is we saw it as an opportunity to grow the business. It historically has been a more fragmented business. The acquisition of Guilbert virtually doubled our size. Frankly, the next competitor to us in size in Europe is half our size in. Scale counts. We think that the European economy will benefit from an improvement in the overall economy, both domestically and internationally. We see growth rates in international this year in local currencies in the low to mid-single digits. As you got larger, it's going to be more difficult to grow those in the high digits in the past (sic). We see emerging opportunities for growth in the new countries that will join the EU. We think that is a long-term opportunity for us. We have a joint venture licensee arrangement today in Poland and Hungary. We think there is an opportunity to expand our business in that part of the world as those countries enter the EU. There's still parts of Europe that we're not in; we don't have a presence in Scandinavia and one day we would like to. Our retail focus in Europe is predominantly France and Spain, and I don't see that changing. We see some improving trends in our French retail business and are encouraged by it. We have about 40 stores and are encouraged by our position there. We have five retail stores in Spain. We are running a little behind what we thought but we're encouraged by results. The overall outlook is that International will continue to become a larger share of the Company. It generates significant returns on capital, generates significantly positive cash flow. We've been overseas since 1990. The currency risk we face internationally is one of translation, not one of transaction, so we are confident about it. We have a great leadership team in Europe, as strong or stronger than anybody in the business. It's a leadership team that's eager to grow and we've got to capital to invest in warehouses and call centers and sales force and new stores in a couple of countries and grow our business. So, we've remained optimistic about Europe and continue to remain optimistic. 14 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call We made improvements in Japan. We said we would cut our operating losses in Japan and we did. Japan has gone through a gut-wrenching economic challenge in terms of the economy; we felt the impact of it. We're encouraged by some store results in Japan. We think we can achieve breakeven there this year. That's a remarkable change. One of the things -- when you invest in Japan, you've got to kind of gut it out for the long-term, so we see that as an opportunity. Frankly, there's parts of the world beyond that in the out years we will look at in terms of our expertise internationally. So it's full of optimism, frankly, and comes off a company that does very well in this segment. No other segment -- no other one in our segment comes close to the organization we have, the infrastructure we have, and the results we have generated. No one in our segment comes close to that. It's something we are enormously proud of. As our North American retail business improves -- as it will -- it just means our earning capacity in the Company grows and our ability to grow shareholder value increases. That's the good news about it. Jeff Black - Lehman Brothers - Analyst Bruce, what about the operating margin in Europe? How much change are we going to see, going forward, or have we already cycled the bulk of the gross margin declines since the expense reductions? What are we looking at next year in terms of the margin -- (multiple speakers)? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, CEO I think operating margins in total -- the outlook for those is pretty stable. The integration of Guilbert does have some impact. We've said all along that we had synergies of the Guilbert acquisition. Some of those synergies are later on as we combine facilities. Our synergies to date have been predominantly in purchasing synergies; those are the easy ones to get. In the out years, we will consolidate warehouses and we will look at building bigger warehouses, multichannel, multibrand. We will look at opportunities to consolidate some G&A functions that have historically been country-by-country. Our success in Europe has been built on a country-by-country organization with the euro as a common currency, with now a 3.something billion dollar business, we think we will drive G&A cost down in Europe. We need some time to do that because of the implication of systems. To remind all of you, businesses fail when they merge in this business -- because they primarily fail because of culture first and integration second. The cultural thing is a marvelous story so far with Guilbert, and the integration of systems, we just begun. We will be careful with it; we will be diligent about it; we will be patient with it, but it will lead to lower G&A cost. Jeff Black - Lehman Brothers - Analyst Just a final refocus on the U.S. -- I mean, do you care to put a date on when we might see the executives in place in the U.S. in the two areas? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, CEO I won't put a date on it because when you recruit, you don't know and you find people that you're interested in and for whatever reason, they are not interested. I said there's a short list; there is. I said that there's some candidates that have strong credentials; there are. It's my single biggest focus. If I've spent enormous time on it. Part of leadership is chemistry. When you get leaders that either apply for or search firms bring to you, they generally come with strong set of skills. You have to blend those skills with a sense of cultural fit, organizational fit and chemistry, and that's not a science. But I am confident we will fill those positions and I'm confident that when we do, they will be good leaders. But unlike some of the things I read in some of the reports, I don't share the doom and gloom that we have until they arrive; I just don't. You always want to enhance and strengthen your leadership; you always want to do that and you always want to grow it, but I never saw this as doom and 15 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call gloom, as some have had, and I never saw this as an inability to execute and generate growth in shareholder value without them. Now, they will add to it but this is a pretty good executive team and I'm pretty proud of it, and we're doing pretty well. On the merchandising side, while we don't have an appointed permanent leader, we've done some things in terms of people and systems and some outside help that are helping us drive results. We're pretty proud of what they've done and we will continue that. So, I've got optimism. When and how we fill them -- stay tuned. You'll be the second to now. (Multiple Speakers) -- second to know. The first will be the people around this room, some of which are directly affected. They will be the first; you'll be the second to know. Operator Mark Arazuria (ph) of Banc of America Securities. Mark Arazuria - Banc of America Securities - Analyst Hey guys, just a quick question on Guilbert -- can you kind of discuss the plans for currency in '04 and just the synergies that you expected versus kind of the currency plan, going forward? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, CEO Let's deal with the synergies first. We have now integrated a substantial part of Guilbert -- sales forces, some purchasing organizations. We've co-mingled who and how we buy from. Our ability to break out synergy (inaudible) Guilbert is not possible any more because it's an integrated part of our organization. So, our comments about results, going forward, will not separate our international performance in Europe from what we had in Guilbert. We are too far down that path. We don't look at them today as separate organizations, separate companies, separate channels. We look at them as how we grow our European business. Our assumptions for currency are predominantly based on the average currency rates that we experienced in 2003. We don't consider ourselves currency experts, and so as you develop plans which predominantly get developed, in our case, late last fall, we basically used an average of the currency for the year to remind all of you earlier in the year the euro was significantly weaker than it is today and is has strengthened throughout the year. We kind of got an average for our assumptions on the outlook we provided you. Operator Margaret Cannella of JP Morgan. Margaret Cannella - J.P. Morgan Chase - Analyst Thank you very much. Consistent with some of the earlier fixed income questions, I wonder if you could go through for us what your liquidity facilities are, bank facilities and any covenants or triggers that might occur if you're rating changed? I guess, obviously, more with a notion of downside in mind and however unlikely that might be, what those triggers might be if there are any? Charles Brown - Office Depot - CFO Okay, I will take that question. Our liquidity, as you know, start with cash. We had almost $900 million in cash. We are entering our peak cash flow-generation cycle, the first quarter of the year, when we start collecting a lot of the vendor rebates, will only get better. 16 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call In terms of our credit facility, we have a $600 million credit line, which is untapped at this time. We will start, some time this year, with -- it's a good time to renew that, so we don't anticipate any problems with renewing this $600 million three-year facility. The fact is we would probably like to push it out a little bit maybe to a five-year facility. Regarding downside risk on our current debt, the only trigger that we have is in the $250 million offering we did back in 2001. Those subordinated notes do have an escalation trigger if we are notched down beyond investment-grade and that's really the only risk. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, CEO I would just add to that, (indiscernible) from where we sit today looking at our business, the outlook for 2004, our ability to generate cash, even in difficult growth periods in North American retail, it's hard for us to have any scenario in which we would have a credit downgrade. Frankly, we think the more likely opportunity is one of an upgrade. If we were to get a credit upgrade, in fact, we have some restrictions -- (multiple speakers) -- offerings -- (multiple speakers) -- it's a benefit and not harm to us, so our perspective, we just can't comprehend today a scenario in which the liquidity of this company reached the point where we could face a credit downgrade. Charles Brown - Office Depot - CFO Again, we will stand by our forward 400 to $450 million of free cash flow next year, so again -- and if we get upgraded, those restrictions on the $250 million offering, they fall away. So to me, it's really only upside. Margaret Cannella - J.P. Morgan Chase - Analyst I agree with you. I want to ask the question only because fixed income investors only have downside. (LAUGHTER). One quick additional question -- is there a seasonal use to cash patterns? How does that work? Charles Brown - Office Depot - CFO Yes, there is actually. As I mentioned earlier, the first quarter is our strongest cash period. Second quarter, we don't generate a lot of cash; it's our softest sales period. We start to build in the third and fourth quarter. A lot of it depends (indiscernible) generate incremental cash flow. It really depends how much spend back in terms of inventory. Our belief this year is we're going to hold inventory flat, so in our third and fourth quarter, we probably should generate excess cash. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman, CEO Okay, thank you very much for taking the time to both listen to our fourth-quarter results, our summary of the fourth quarter, kind of an overview of the year, and our optimism as we enter 2004. We have worked diligently to grow shareholder value. We've invested significantly in infrastructure, organization, talent and capabilities. We have made numerous changes to our business model, both in retail and North American delivery business and our International business, and we will continue to make even more changes. We entered 2004 with a significant amount of optimism for the year. We believe that our performance will get better each quarter. We will comp positive this quarter in North American retail, and that will break a 16-quarter trend of negative comps. Now, I say that minus a significant world event, but there just has to be something awful happen in the world for us to come off-track of where we are quarter-to-date. 17 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call I've never been more confident about Office Depot's future, even though I'm still trying to fill two key positions. I've never felt better about the progress we've made in our organization, in our business models and our focus. This organization is better focused than it has ever been, and that doesn't just start with our executive team; that starts with our 50,000 people who know our seven key strategies in depth; they know the specific action plans and steps that we will take to achieve those strategies and we report both to them and to our Board on how we're doing. It's called focus; it's called focus on executing what you say you are going to do. I'm confident about our ability to do that. With an improving business environment -- and I hope there is one that improves -- then I think our results can even be better than we've outlined. Thanks very much for taking the time to listen to us. Have a great day. We will talk to you all later.

CORPORATE PARTICIPANTS Eileen Dunn Office Depot Incorporated - Vice President of Investor Relations Bruce Nelson Office Depot Incorporated - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer PRESENTATION Operator Thank you for holding, this is the conference coordinator. This call is being taped. You may go ahead with the conference call. Eileen Dunn - Office Depot Incorporated - Vice President of Investor Relations Good morning. This is Eileen Dunn, Office Depot's Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Before Bruce begins his comments this morning, let me remind that you except for historical information, the matters discussed in this case message are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act. Forward-looking statements including projections and anticipated levels of future performance involve risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed here in. These risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time by Office Depot in our filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, including and without limitation are 10-K and 10-Q filings. You are strongly urged to review such filings for a more detailed discussion of such risks and uncertainties. Now let me turn this morning's call over to Bruce Nelson, Office Depot's Chairman and CEO. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot Incorporated - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Eileen. This morning, we announce the several changes in our executive management team. And have taped this message to provide you with more insight into our new appointments and expectations for the future. First is the change in our north American retail organization. Jerry Colley has discussed with me for many months his personal desire to retire from a career that spans over 30 years in retailing. Like anyone, Jerry would prefer to go out on a winning note and the fact is that our positive, North American retail performance in early 2004 gives Jerry the opportunity to leave as a winner. To replace Jerry, I have appointed Rick Lepley as EVP North American Retail. Rick is a season the veteran both at Office Depot and other senior management positions elsewhere. Rick is a builder and an entrepreneur both by background and personality. He has an extensive background in retailing first in the automotive business followed by office products under the Office Depot retail name in Poland and Hungary. Most recently he lead the turnaround of our Japanese retail operations and delivery businesses. Over the past few months, he has been in the role of refining and prototyping the latest version of millennium, the format we will use as we enter the Northwestern and Mid Atlantic markets. Rick is the right person to take us forward into a major building and expansion phase as we plan to open 80 to 100 new North American stores in 2004 including many of the 50 to 60 retail stores recently acquired from Kids "R" Us. He will build on the solid foundation that Jerry leaves behind and he will drive us towards the goal of profitably growing North American retail far more rapidly than we've been able to accomplish in the past several years. 2 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Broadcast Second is the change in our marking organization. Jocelyn Carter-Miller has expressed for quite sometime her desires to direct her considerable skills and experience toward expanding a family, entrepreneurial business with her husband. She has a great passion for helping youth and the community prosper and for becoming the successful entrepreneur and she has earned the right to try a different path. After our initial discussions, I asked Jocelyn to remain with our team through the women's conference for which she provided excellent leadership and guidance. I am pleased and grateful she was willing to do so and we wish her well in her new endeavors. Knowing her as I do, I am convinced that she will be very successful in the future. We are fortunate to have a talented individual like Chuck Rubin to take up the leadership reigns in our marketing organization. Chuck has already brought tremendous new vitality to our merchandising organization and he already works closely with Joslyn and her marketing team. Finally, we are announcing a change in our human resource leadership as Jay Crosson has decided to leave our company and pursue other opportunities both in terms of lifestyle and geography. Jay and his wife are eager to relocate closer to family and while Jay intends to remain actively working for several more years, he wants to change the focus of his activities somewhat. Even as we regret losing Jay, we are extremely fortunate to be in a position to immediately name a long time member of our board of directors, Frank Scrubbs as our new EVP of Human Resources. Frank has been a prominent labor and employment attorney for decades in Florida, and his reputation extends far beyond this state. Frank will bring his many years of experience and creativity to his new post and we are absolutely excited to have him move from the advisory role that he has filled so well in our board to being a full-time contributor to the success of our company. Frank is stepping down from his position on our board to join our management team and the continuity of many years of experience on our board, which now shifts to our executive team is extremely helpful. These three new individuals appointed to our executive leadership team are seasoned veterans who already have deep knowledge of our company and its culture. Each brings with him unique skill sets that I believe will enhance our leadership team and help drive us forward into the future. We are fortunate to have these capable individuals chosen from within our existing team and board of directors eager to step forward and ensure that we proceed with continuity in the progress of the past four years since I became CEO of Office Depot. That progress is reflected in our performance to date in 2004. While we have not yet completed our first quarter, which ends March 27th, we are encouraged by our results to date. Our North American retail comps are positive quarter to date. And we remain fully confident that EPS will grow in the 15 to 20% range in 2004. We are beginning to see the benefits of the many changes we have implemented in North America retail over the past 12 months. We have a renewed sense of strength and optimism as we embark on the most ambitious new North America store opening plans in many years augmented by the recent acquisition of 124 Kids "R" Us sites primarily in the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states. And our other businesses, which in aggregate are actually larger than our North American retail business also continue to grow, especially in Europe where we continue to enjoy consistent outstanding performance. Change is an essential ingredient to growth. These executive changes and realignment all from within the company strengthen our organization and increase our ability to successfully implement and execute our strategic objectives for 2004 and beyond. We have great confidence that these changes will make our company even a better place to work, shop and invest. Thank you very much for listening today. Operator Thank you for calling the digital replay service. 3 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

First an overall summary, sales were up, North American comps were positive and earnings were up. In 11 of the last 12 quarters, including this one, earnings have met or exceeded expectations. Our seven key strategic initiatives we outlined last year are delivering promised results and are positioning us for accelerating growth rates in both sales and earnings for the remainder of 2004 and beyond. As a reminder, those seven strategies are -- number one, reposition our North American real estate portfolio; two, control costs while 2 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call enhancing quality; three, create a customer centric experience; four, develop differentiated product assortments; five, excel in Europe; six, grow our people, talent and leadership; and seven, builder acquired to generate breakthrough growth. Before I turn the call over to Charlie Brown, our CFO, who will discuss our financial performance, and Chuck Rubin, our new EVP of Merchandising and Marketing who will share with you some additional insight into our North American business, I would like to provide you some brief headlines on each of the initiatives and how our actions are translating into results full in the first-quarter as is well into the future. First, strategy number one, reposition our North American real estate portfolio. Our purchase of the Kids 'R' portfolio will give us the opportunity to convert 50 to 60 of the 124 sites we acquired to Office Depot stores and 25 to 30 of those sites will become the foundation for our entry into new northeastern markets. Including the KRU sites, we now plan to open 80 to 100 new stores in the second half of this year and remodel another 50 or 60 older Office Depot stores as well. Virtually all of these new stores and remodels will be designed around our Millennium 2 format, or M2, which reflects all of the customer and operational earnings of our original Millennium format that's designed around a lower overall operating cost. Strategy number two, control cost while enhancing quality. 12 consecutive quarters of reducing North American warehouse operating cost as a percentage of sales have resulted in more than $150 million in savings in the past three years at the same time increasing virtually every important customer quality measure metric. This quarter was no exception. Our numerous global purchasing initiatives are beginning to be reflected in overall lower purchasing costs, higher gross margin dollars and percentages, and increasing our worldwide assortment of private-label offerings. Strategy number three, create a customer centric experience. The launch of our new North American Office Depot Advantage program, which rewards customers for purchases and loyalty and provides us the ability to recognize our customers across all channels. Office Depot Advantage customers tend to buy more frequently, give us a higher share of wallet, purchase from more than one channel, have an average ticket higher than our non-Advantage customers. Strategy number four, develop a differentiated product assortment. Our unique and proprietary Christopher Lowell line of office and home furniture and accessories offer customers design, functionality and value that no other office supply superstore retailer offers; as a result continue to exceed our expectations. Our significant technology assortment changes and results in our North American retail speak for themselves; 11 percent positive comp growth in technology in quarter one 2004 versus -20 percent comp declines in the first-quarter of 2003. During the second-quarter we will expand our notebook assortments, the fastest-growing hardware category, and at the same time significantly remerchandise plan-o-grams and signing more than two-thirds of our North American stores by the end of this quarter. Strategy number five, excel in Europe. The Guilbert acquisition remains on track to deliver planned results. International revenues in the quarter were 27 percent of the Company's total and the operating profits from our international businesses were almost 40 percent of our consolidated company results in this quarter. Our French retail comps grew almost 18 percent during the quarter and early in the second-quarter we acquired our Hungarian franchiee business giving us a solid management team and a strategic gateway for future growth in Eastern Europe as 10 new countries will soon enter the European Union. Strategy number six, grow our people, talent and leadership. We strengthened our executive leadership with the employment of three new executives to head North American retail stores, North American merchandising, marketing and global human resources. We continue to make large investments in the training and development of our people on a worldwide basis. Strategy number seven, build or acquire to generate breakthrough growth. We will keep you informed, updated as appropriate. I'd now like to turn the call over to Charlie Brown, our CFO, who will discuss our financial performance, and then Chuck Rubin who will share with you additional information insights into our North American business and merchandising marketing issues. Charlie Brown - Office Depot - CFO Thanks, Bruce. Good morning, everyone. Total company sales for the first-quarter grew by 18 percent to $3.6 billion compared to the first-quarter of 2003. Worldwide comparable sales in our 909 stores and 37 delivery centers increased 2 percent during the period.

Earnings Conference Call increased 27 percent to 762 million compared to the same period last year, further expanding our industry leadership position. Operating profit for the first-quarter increased by 9 percent to $176 million. Our profit performance reflects strong European results bolstered with the addition of Guilbert operations and favorable currency rates, continued growth in our large customer segment in North America, and improvement in our North American retail sales. General and administrative costs as a percent of sales were down sequentially by almost 100 basis points in the first-quarter, but up over last year primarily as a result of consolidating Guilbert into our international segment and stronger European currencies. In February of this year we announced our efforts to more fully allocate our general and administrative expenses to our business units. While this process has no impact on our reported net income, we believe it will provide better insight into business unit profitability. We have not completed this analysis. While some allocations are relatively easy, our support functions are highly integrated and support all business units therefore developing a meaningful allocation methodology is a complicated process. We will continue to develop our allocation methodology while also evaluating the cost and the benefits of this effort. Net earnings per diluted share were 37 cents compared with 25 cents for the first pay period last year. Included in first-quarter of 2004 was a $4 million charge, or a penny a share, (inaudible) certain outstanding litigation. Included in 2003 results was the adoption of EITF 02-16 which reduced diluted earnings per share by 8 cents for the first-quarter. Now let's turn to the individual segment results. International sales, which now represent 27 percent of our consolidated sales, grew 78 percent in local currencies and 94 percent in U.S. dollars during the quarter. These results reflect the addition of our Guilbert acquisition as well as solid sales gains in all countries except Germany, the Netherlands and Japan. International sales reported in U.S. dollars benefited from stronger foreign currency rates in the first-quarter of 2004 by $81 million, a significant portion of which was anticipated in our 2004 plan. European sales continue to be the main growth vehicle for Office Depot International. Overall European Viking catalog sales were solid and (indiscernible) retail comps reached almost 18 percent in the quarter. International gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased by about 300 basis points in the first-quarter of 2004, reflecting a higher mix of lower margin contract sales partially offset by better buying and increased purchasing discounts associated with our Guilbert acquisition. The increase in total store and warehouse operating and selling expenses reflects the addition of Guilbert. However, selling and warehouse expenses as a percent of sales declined almost 300 basis points compared to the prior year because of the planned cost reductions and increased leverage from higher sales volume. International segment operating profit also benefited from foreign exchange rates by 12.8 million during the quarter when translated into U.S. dollars. This was another strong quarter for our international segment bolstered by the acquisition of Guilbert. Our integration remains on track, our (indiscernible) is in place in all countries and doing well. At this point we're capturing the purchasing synergies we modeled and are making good progress in rationalizing the combined infrastructures. For North American business services group total sales were flat in the quarter. Contract sales increased 3 percent with higher growth rates among our large customer segments offset by continued softness in our catalog businesses. While our domestic catalog business remained soft during the quarter, the Office Depot brand catalog did achieve planned sales and is on track to reach positive sales growth in the second half of this year. Domestic e-commerce sales grew 11 percent during the quarter. We now expect our worldwide e-commerce sales this year to exceed $3 billion continuing Office Depot's industry leadership position in this channel. Both gross profit and total (inaudible) warehouse operating and selling expenses in this segment were relatively unchanged in the first-quarter of 2004 compared to the same period of last year. We are continuing to benefit from our focused growth initiatives in the large customer segment. During the quarter we completed the strategic realignment of our sales force which we expect to accelerate growth rates in our small and medium customer segments for the remainder of this year. Our North American warehouses had another strong quarter with operating costs as a percentage of sales continuing to decline. Warehouse operating costs have now declined in each of the past 12 quarters resulting in more than $150 million of cost reductions over the past three years. And finally, our North American retail business. Total sales increased 5 percent to 1.6 billion in the quarter and our comparable sales increased 3 percent. That's a 10 percent improvement over first-quarter of last year. The increase in comparable sales was primarily attributable to increased 4 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call sales of technology which are a direct result of several technology merchandising initiatives launched in the fourth-quarter of 2003. During the quarter the Company opened three new retail stores, relocated three stores and closed three stores. At the end of the first-quarter we operated a total of 900 office product superstores throughout North America. Office Depot has the oldest store base among our direct competitors at just over eight years and, as you know, older stores comp at lower rates. As our total comparable sales have improved we are very encouraged that the 75 stores opened in the last three years that are now in our comp base are growing at 15 to 20 percent per year. This year we expect to open 80 to 100 new stores and remodel more than 50 to 60 stores in our M2 format which we expect will further strengthen our comp store trends. Increased sales of technology products, which generally have lower margins, adversely affect the gross profit as a percentage of sales during the quarter. Occupancy costs also increased as planned reflecting more new stores in our base. Gross profit percentages in our core office supply categories increased on a year-over-year basis. Store payroll experienced significant leverage from increased sales. However, these savings were more than offset by planned higher advertising expenses compared to the same period in the prior year and the costs associated with closing -- with the planned closure of three stores. I would now like to briefly share some of our balance sheet and cash flow metrics for the total company. Our cash and short-term investments exceeded $1 billion at the end of the first-quarter. Inventory levels were up slightly from last year to 1.2 billion because of the addition of Guilbert. Without Guilbert inventories were actually down about $40 million compared to last year. Free cash flow was $185 million in the first-quarter and capital expenditures totaled 70 million for the period. We remain on track for CAPEX in the $300 to $350 million range, flat inventory levels and free cash flow generation of $400 to $450 million for the year. These numbers exclude the impacts of the previously announced Kids 'R' Us transaction. And finally, we continue to expect 2004 EPS growth in the range of 15 to 20 percent compared to non-GAAP EPS in 2003 of $1.04 or about $1.20 to $1.25 for this year. For the second-quarter we expect 15 to 20 percent growth in EPS compared to the 19 cents reported last year. As previously noted, we launched a number of focused merchandising and marketing initiatives during 2003 which are driving growth in our North American retail business. I would now like to turn the call over to Chuck Rubin who will provide more insight into our plans and initiatives. Chuck Rubin - Office Depot - EVP Merchandising and Marketing Good morning, everybody. I'm very pleased to speak to you about our positive Q1 results. The focus of my comments today concerning performance will be primarily our North American retail. My comments concerning our initiatives and go forward strategies will generally apply to retail as well as our other direct channels. Overall our Q1 performance was achieved through disciplined execution of our merchandising strategies. It included a more analytical fact based assortment management and promotional planning process along with tighter integration of merchandising, marketing, inventory management and store operations. We manage our product assortments in four distinct groupings -- technology, furniture, supplies, and copy and print. During this quarter tech, furniture and supplies, the majority of our business, comped positive and the core foundation of businesses that make up each also comped positive. In terms of gross margin we achieved higher rates in most of the core product categories; this was partially offset, as you heard, by the impact of a higher penetration of technology sales on the overall sales mix. Nonetheless our total gross margin dollars improved over the year earlier quarter. To provide some additional context around our performance let me speak for a moment about each of our major product groupings. In technology desktops and laptops contributed greatly to our improved results. The performance of laptops was especially noteworthy as the trend towards mobility becomes more prevalent. Our core customers are increasingly seeking products that help them capitalize on this mobility movement and we intend to capitalize on this trend. We also realized our 'take-with' assortment to reflect the brands, prices and promotions that customers desired. We accomplished this while still improving our inventory turnover. Strong inventory management and our best in class supply chain capabilities enabled this. Additionally we enhanced our configurative (ph) order or CTO platform. Previously our CTO customer experience was inconsistent. To successfully execute our strategies we made appropriate investments to deliver a customer friendly front end. Additionally we leveraged the assets of our 4Sure 5 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call division along with our close vendor relations. This effort delivered strong comps and wide praise from both our customers and our vendors. HP, our largest vendor, credited Office Depot as being best in class in this type of offering. This CTO capability is significant because it allows Office Depot another means to deliver an outstanding customer service. Financially it is attractive because it delivers incremental sales with no inventory investment. This CTO offering will be a key component of our go forward strategy to help profitably manage the lifecycle demands of our TC business. Rounding out technology sales were strong sales improvements in higher margin businesses like software and services, for example warranties. This also is critical to our strategy of developing broadbase solutions for our customers that have provided improved sales and margin basket for Office Depot. Turning to furniture, our comps there were positive as well. Driving this performance was desking which is our foundation department in furniture; computer furniture, which benefited from our stronger technology sales; and as Bruce mentioned, our exclusive Christopher Lowell collections of furniture and accessories. This last point is particularly important. Not only does Christopher Lowell product deliver strong sales and margins, it represents the successful implementation of our strategy to deliver great looking high-quality and high-value product. We believe this will serve to extend our market leadership position within furniture. Our largest product division, supplies, achieved positive comp sales as well, specifically we exceeded last year's performance in our core departments of paper, ink and toner, dated goods and school supplies. The performance of this last category, school supplies, was driven by our commitment to maintain a 365 day presence in this product. Our final product division, copy, print and ship, experienced slightly negative comps. This was due to softness in our black and white copy business, which is a diminishing component of our offering, and our shipping business. The latter we believe is a result of the increased UPS retail presence. As we look forward we plan on improving this part of our business by offering a broader range of shipping choices to our customers. On the positive side, a number of critical milestones were achieved during Q1 in our copy and print business. Specifically we successfully implemented the organizational and technical infrastructure necessary to allow us to capitalize on this business segment. Let me turn for a moment to the results of a few of our key merchandising initiatives. Each of these has been critical in our Q1 performance and are building blocks of our go forward strategies. I'll start with our Magellan project managed by Mark Holifield which is the largest single business project in Office Depot history is both on time and on budget. We are in month 13 of a 33 month rollout. During this first-quarter the successful implementation of a number of modules allowed us to achieve the following -- improved planning and forecasting capabilities; improved replenish with greater service levels and less inventory; and significantly improved store planning capabilities which will become critical as we accelerate our store opening schedule for the balance of this year. Other key merchandising initiatives included a comprehensive review of product pricing which delivered incremental margin in the first-quarter; increased private brand penetration which has added to our margins and supported our product differentiation strategy; continued focus on inventory management which resulted in improved inventory productivity for Q1; and global purchasing which accelerated our ability to leverage the buying power of our worldwide company. Turning to advertising, our spend in Q1 achieved our plan which, in fact, higher than last year. The incremental dollars were primarily in inserts in local retail marketing. As we look at Q2 our plan calls for a moderation of this trend and we are, in fact, on plan for the second-quarter. During Q1 we conducted a performance analysis of our various retail media vehicles and have begun to implement changes based on that analysis. We also improved in store sales and margin productivity by applying a more rigorous structured earned space approach to select product, offers and layout. As was mentioned, we launched our loyalty program, Office Depot Advantage. Initial membership and sales results have exceeded expectations with over 1 million members enrolled in the first month. And finally, our strategy targeting our core customers through our event marketing continued. The Office Depot fourth annual Success Strategies Convention for Businesswomen was a highly visible and highly attended event. Let me turn to Q2 for a moment and touch on just a few points where we will conduct to focus our attention. First and foremost disciplined execution of our merchandising and marketing efforts. This is absolutely critical to our strategy and the entire management team is aligned on this topic. As 6 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call an example, Rick Lepley, who heads our stores, and I will be providing standardized presentation guidelines for all of our stores to ensure a consistent customer shopping experience. Layered on top of this centralized merchandising direction will be a decentralized customer service program that will continue to provide our stores great latitude in providing fanatical customer service. Second, as Bruce mentioned, in two-thirds of our stores we will introduce a new technology layout which will drive sales and margin by supporting our expanded assortments and drive higher attachment rates. We have tested this concept during the first-quarter and it's produced very strong results. Third, we will continue to apply a more disciplined assortment rationalization process to improve our productivity. Fourth, we will realign our marketing spend to reflect a more rigorous fact-based allocation approach. We expect this to improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of our spend. And fifth, we will continue to scale our private brand business. In summary, before I turn the call back to Bruce, let me just add an overarching comment. During my first four months with Office Depot we have made much progress enhancing the disciplines to create and successfully execute our strategies. This along with the collaboration, enthusiasm and efforts displayed by our team has led to our improved Q1 performance. I think importantly it is also evidence of the significant opportunities that lie ahead. Again, thank you very much and now I'll turn the call back to Bruce. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman & CEO Before I turn the call over for questions I'd like just to briefly summarize. First, our strategic initiatives and actions are producing tangible results. From repositioning our North American real estate portfolio to delighting customers with outstanding service and rewarding them for loyalty, to giving customers a broader and more unique range of product assortments, through expanding our leadership position in Europe and worldwide e-commerce, and by building our organization, leadership and capabilities we are fundamentally changing the way we do business. We are investing in enterprise systems to drive revenues and lower costs. Systems like Magellan, which Chuck spoke about, are delivering results. Systems like PeopleSoft, which turns data into information on a more timely basis, helps us lead, manage and understand our business on a more timely insightful basis. Investments in warehouse technology that have driven productivity and enhanced quality, our M2 format will be a highly differentiated office supply superstore format. We're using the Intranet to drive efficiency in internal processes and we are changing significantly the way we look at advertising and marketing spend to make them more effective and efficient than ever. We have a maniacal focus on execution from our seven strategic initiatives to our North American sales force realignment to excelling in Europe. Much has changed at Office Depot but, in the four years I've been the CEO, our core values of respect for the individual, fanatical customer service and excellent execution have not changed. Our goal to be the most compelling place to work, shop and invest has not changed. Our focus, our methodology, our leadership, our tools, our systems have changed and we believe the first-quarter is indicative of the kind of results we expect to generate for the rest of 2004 and beyond. What I'd like to do now is turn the call over to you for your questions. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Operator (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS) Dan Binder. Dan Binder - Buckingham Research - Analyst It's Dan Binder of Buckingham. A couple questions for you. First, can give us a little bit more color on the Advantage program in terms of the average spend and frequency that you referred to as being greater than I guess the average customer? And then if you could address what the currency benefit to EPS was. And perhaps what other technology changes you're making this quarter beyond the laptop assortments. 7 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman & CEO Well the first question, Dan, is in the first month we had more than a million of our customers sign up for our advantage program on average. Averages sometimes get you in trouble. They spend 2.5 times greater. Their average ticket is also higher. But more importantly, these are our most loyal, frequent, core customers who we've now given more reasons to buy from Office Depot; and second, by understanding more of who they are, and they're willing to give us information about them, we can more precisely pinpoint our advertising and marketing spend to provide them value and reasons to buy and stay with Office Depot. On the currency impact, on the operating side in the international is 12.8 million -- that is offset by the G&A costs which go negative (indiscernible). And remember, a significant part of that was already in our plan when we outlined 2004's results. And finally, as it relates to merchandise, I don't think it serves us well to go into the specificity of all of the initiatives we plan to put in place in the second-quarter in merchandising. But for (indiscernible) to say of the two-thirds of a chain that we're going to touch there is some additional assortment, as Chuck pointed out, mostly in notebook. More importantly adjacencies are better. We believe attachment rates will be better. we believe accessory sales will be better. And that's not just a belief, it's based on some tests we've run in the first-quarter. That's as much depth as I'd like to talk about the assortment in the second-quarter. Certainly when the second-quarter ends, and we believe it will end better than the first in every category, we'll give you some more insight as to what drove that. But we remain confident about the fact that each quarter this year and retail in particular will comp better than the previous quarter. Dan Binder - Buckingham Research - Analyst And just one final question. You've been slowly relocating stores and remodeling. Do you have any results that you can share with us at this point on some of that activity? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman & CEO I think the most insightful result was what Charlie pointed out that if you look at the 70 some new stores we've opened in the last three years, which, by the way, in our base isn't very many, those stores today are growing 15 to 20 percent in comps. So I think relocation, frankly, looked an awful lot like a new store in metrics, even if you just move it down the street a mile or two, it has all the metrics of a new store. So we continue to put disciplined approach to sight selection. We've talked about some tools in the past that we've used that we believe are more sophisticated. Our investment in systems helps us do that. We believe today our analytics to choose sights is better than it's ever been before. And we continue to look at every store as it ages and comes up for renewal as to whether or not we want to make an investment in it, whether we want to keep it or whether we want to remodel it. That's part of our key strategy about repositioning our North American real estate. That is a little longer-term issue because it's going to take us a couple of years. But with the foundation of the KRU stores, our M2 format, which is differentiated, and, by the way, we believe will be lower operating cost model, will allow us to continue to invest in real estate and earn our cost of capital. Dan Binder - Buckingham Research - Analyst Great, thanks. Nice quarter. Operator Aram Rubinson. 8 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Aram Rubinson - Banc of America - Analyst Banc of America. A couple things. I see the 10-K is just starting to -- or 10-Q is just starting to come out and (indiscernible) just yet. Can you just help us understand two things? One, the retail gross margin, if you can give us kind of where this all washes out because just in terms of how that compared to LY? And then secondarily, on the paper business, can you give us a sense as to what the rising commodity costs there have done to either the sales or the margins in that business? And then the final thing, sorry, is when you roll out the technology assortment in Q2 how many variations of that will there be once you're fully national? Thanks. Charlie Brown - Office Depot - CFO Our gross profit in retail first-quarter was down about 50 basis points. Again, that was mainly mix driven. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman & CEO As Chuck pointed out, margins in core office supplies were actually up, and so the 50 basis points in total is predominantly a merchandise mix issue. If the gross margin dollars were up, which is more important, comp margin dollars were up -- it's margin dollars you run the business by. I'll let Chuck respond to both the technology question and the paper question. Chuck Rubin - Office Depot - EVP Merchandising and Marketing On the technology side, firstly, the assortment, all of our full-service stores will, in terms of a core, that is and in the adjacent attachments (technical difficulty) other peripherals, the main driving desktops and laptops. As the store volume increases as we go into larger volume stores that assortment will expand as well, but our investment is across the Company in technology. As far as the paper issue is concerned, certainly there are issues out there. But those are issues we continue to work through. From a cost standpoint we obviously are a big paper user; from an advertising perspective we have long-term contracts that we feel comfortable with in terms of paper that we sell. There is some price implication, some margin implication for us. We continue to manage through that and we'll see how that shakes out over the next couple of quarters. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman & CEO The most challenging time we have in rising paper cost is an our contract business where we have commitments to customers that we honor for periods of time. It's less easy to pass all of those cost increases through. On the retail side you can price more quickly, but the market for paper stays incredibly competitive. This will just have to unfold throughout the year. There is a little margin pressure in paper, but I think the take away, Aram, is that the core business margins were up in retail across the product categories, across most categories basis point improvement in margins quarter-over-quarter. Aram Rubinson - Banc of America - Analyst Thanks, nice to see the positive comp. Good luck. Operator Colin McGranahan. Colin McGranahan - Sanford Bernstein - Analyst Stanford Bernstein. Two questions. First, could you talk a little bit about -- it sounds like in BSG that the Viking catalog business was the weakest aspect of that. Can you talk a little bit about what's going on there and maybe talk about your reorganization of the sales force, how that's going 9 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved. Republication or redistribution of Thomson Reuters content, including by framing or similar means, is prohibited without the prior written consent of Thomson Reuters. 'Thomson Reuters' and the Thomson Reuters logo are registered trademarks of Thomson Reuters and its affiliated companies. APRIL 22, 2004 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q1 2004 Office Depot Inc. Earnings Conference Call to change the outlook? And then just housekeeping, maybe if you could give us a sense of what those three store closures, how that affected operating costs in the first quarter? Thanks. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman & CEO Let me try to answer your questions. On the catalog business, actually we had softness in both the Depot brand and the Viking brand. We had some encouragement on the Depot brand because for the first time in some time it hit its plan. So we planned the Depot to have a more difficult first half versus the second. We've said all along we thought we would turn positive in the second. And it appears on the Depot brand we're on track. On the Viking side it has to do with prospecting response rates and some margin pressure in prospecting and the cost to acquire. And so Viking's a cost -- a prospecting model that acquires new customers by significant mailings and some of the prospecting is not responding in rate as it once did. So we're refining lists, mailings, frequency, size of book, type of book to try and generate Viking revenue growth. I'll remind you that even thought this struggles a bit with growth, this is an enormously profitable business, generates and throws off significant cash. And we'll get it to grow but this is not a bad business, this is still a very good solid business. In terms of the reorganization of the sales force, I think it's suffice to say that we have basically taken a look at where we have salespeople, how we've deployed them, what kinds of behavior we expect from them and we've focused then predominantly on bifurcating, if you will, some of our sales force focused on acquiring and obtaining new business and a good portion of our sales force growing share of wallet and expanding the wallet of existing business. We like what we see in early results. Whenever you do that it's somewhat disruptive to your sales force and it certainly has been planned in the sense that planned we understood it. Our encouraging signs in BSG is the large customer segment and the national account segments are growing at very healthy rates and we believe that as the quarter goes on, this quarter and into next half of the year we'll see some accelerating growth rates in our small and medium-sized businesses. As it relates to the closing of three stores, we don't break out the cost. This is a normal process of refining your portfolio. This is three stores out of 900. There are some costs in there, they are all the costs of (inaudible) but we don't, for a variety of reasons, Colin, break out the specificity of those. Colin McGranahan - Sanford Bernstein - Analyst Just a quick follow-up on the contract then. Can you briefly comment on the pricing as it looks like demand is improving? And I think you had originally looked for high single digit growth in BSG given first-quarter was flat. Are you still comfortable with that? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman & CEO For the year we're comfortable with accelerating growth rates in BSG. First of all, we are. Second of all, from the pricing standpoint of BSG I think it's pretty much the same as always. The larger account can sometimes get irrational at the huge national highly visible accounts. But I don't know that that's accelerated any more than it used to. It's a competitive environment. Customers today are smarter than they once were; they have more information how to buy better than they once did. We provide an in-depth analysis how to buy better. Frankly, one of our objectives is to lower the cost of the acquisition of office supplies to more customers. We think that's one of the reasons why they stay with us. So, there's always margin pressure there but I don't -- it's not any more than it's ever been and I think we manage that business quite well and in spite of not growing a more profitable gross margin from a small and medium-size business, this business segment is still enormously profitable. And that's a good (indiscernible) to do is the fact that we've taken so much cost out of this business and our quality is good. So we're still optimistic about growth in BSG throughout the year. The best evidence we have of it is the growth in the large and the very large customer base. And we've got some very strong growth in some very important regions across the U.S. in this category -- or this segment. 10 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Colin McGranahan - Sanford Bernstein - Analyst Thanks. Good luck with the initiatives. Operator Jeff Black. Jeff Black - Lehman Brothers - Analyst Lehman Brothers. I just had a quick overall question. We've got accelerating comps, we've got accelerating, hopefully, sales in North American delivery. It looks like you beat your own expectations for the first-quarter but we don't have any raised guidance here. What's the disconnect there? What are you seeing out there now in your business that makes you a little more conservative than we thought you'd be? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman & CEO The answer is we are now a grand total of 20 days into April. I'm encouraged by what we see so far. We believe we'll continue to accelerate. Frankly I think at this point -- this answers a good number of questions a number of you had. We've had a great quarter. We believe that we'll deliver another one the second-quarter and our results will speak for themselves as it relates to guidance. We're still going to grow this company in terms of EPS this year over the 104 last year, 15 to 20 percent. There's nothing that we're seeing that takes away from our optimism for the year. There's an awful lot of things going wrong in the economy, you want to make sure you continue to be solid, but we remain very confident about our business. Jeff Black - Lehman Brothers - Analyst Fair enough. And just a follow-up. Where are you coming in on costs specifically with the Millennium 2 format versus the old format? And the 50 to 60 remodels that you're going to do I guess are all Millennium 2's. Is that an indication that we've got a format here that you can move forward with and refurbish a bigger part of the store base? And if that's the case, how much would you expect to eventually remodel? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman & CEO The answer to the question is we now believe our M2 format will be in the 250 to 300 range, down from the 350 to 400 range of the M1 format, that's first and foremost. To this we're also convinced that some of our smaller older stores may not take a full 250 to do, so 250 is kind of an average. Three, by the fact that we're going to do 50 or 60 remodels in the second half of this year and make sure we execute those flawlessly, that we do this without too much customer disruption and we understand how to do these. Assuming we do that well, and we think we well, then as you look into 2005 we would significantly accelerate our remodel program in 2005 and 2006. We also think, as I said earlier, without going today into a lot of specificity that the way we've designed into will be a much more efficient labor model than even we have today. Charlie spoke earlier, we had good payroll leverage in North American retail in the first-quarter. We think M2 will give us even more leverage going forward. And our real focus is to lower the breakeven point both of existing stores and new stores. And I talked earlier about our maniacal focus. As we enter the northeast you can rest assured that we're going to that with the best, most efficient, lowest cost highly executed model we know how to do and we've lined up the resources necessary to do that. So give us a couple of quarters of results and we'll give you a lot more insight as to what those stores are doing, how they're performing and our expectations for 2005 and 2006. But at this stage to say we're optimistic would be a good way to characterize what we believe M2 can do. Jeff Black - Lehman Brothers - Analyst Okay, great. Thank you very much. 11 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Operator Matthew Fassler. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs - Analyst Goldman Sachs. I'd like to ask three questions, and the first couple dig into some of the details of the financial outlook in the retail business. It sounds from Chuck's comments like you're sharpening your marketing spend in the first-quarter and that's unlikely to be a drag. That said, you've got some new store expenses and remodeling expenses that are likely to hit the numbers as we move through the year. Do you think that as comps presumably stay at this level or accelerate a bit like you should be able to get expense leverage at retail? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman & CEO I'll let Charlie answer part of this, Matt. Let me speak to the advertising. Chuck pointed out that we did increase advertising spend planned in the first-quarter. I might comment about that -- in the first-quarter of last year we tried to reallocate advertising dollars and spend and it proved out not to work which is why we plan to get back to kind of "normal spend levels" and we believe we've now got the model in terms of ad price spend that works, we're going to continue to refine it. As to the second question about leverage, yes, I believe that our North American retail business will make more money this year than it did last for the full year, even though that's not true in the first-quarter. So we'll see the flow-through of increasing comps and payroll average. Third, we still -- we have not -- on the toy stores -- the Kid's stores, we plan to close those stores in May. In other words where we physically take the possession of those. We are putting together our specific store opening plan for the second half, and as we get that more synced up -- I mean when we get the site, when we can take it over, when we can get construction -- give all of you some clarity as to what that means to us in terms of store operating costs, opening costs and new store opening costs. But we still in total remain confident about the 15 to 20 percent EPS growth this year. Charlie Brown - Office Depot - CFO Let me also add that last year, as you know, we had a fair amount of clearancing activity -- (indiscernible) activities as we got ready for merchandising issues that we had launched in the third and fourth quarter. We won't have that activity this year and so any new store expenses are pretty much going to be offset. So we're still comfortable with our 15 to 20 percent even with those store openings in. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs - Analyst You just anticipated my second question which related to the peculiar gross margin compare in the second-quarter. It sounds like you should expect the mix shift to be able to deliver an outsized gross margin increase over that depressed number, is that fair to say? Eileen Dunn - Office Depot - Director IR Yes, we should. And again we were up in gross margin dollars, down in rate but up in dollars. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs - Analyst Yes, down in rate year-to-year off last year's number? 12 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Charlie Brown - Office Depot - CFO Yes. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs - Analyst Okay. My final question relates to international. Can you tell us --just as we try to dig a little deeper into the number with the acquisition and currency it's hard to get a sense of the underlying trend. If you're to look at the legacy businesses that Office Depot owned a year ago, what kind of growth did you see in local currency in those numbers? And then if you could give us some sense as to the contribution of -- I guess that we could calculate the contribution of the acquisition. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman & CEO Two things, Matt. First of all, the Viking catalog businesses in Europe had a good quarter, as did the Office Depot startup contract businesses in most countries had a good quarter and the existing French retail business Office Depot had a good quarter. And the strong growth was -- kept those (technical difficulty) Second, we were way down the path of integration. It is increasingly more difficult for us to operate existing legacy Office Depot/Viking from integrateds that are there. We've integrated sales forces, we've integrated management teams. We haven't integrated many facilities albeit a few small ones. And as time goes on this will be impossible to segment. Needless to say, we believe we achieved from Guilbert what we planned to achieved. There was some softness in Guilbert's business compared to last year for them in the UK and France. But remember, that was not in our base. It's just more and more difficult for us, Matt, to break out, and you'll see us once we've anniversaried the Guilbert, which comes in the second-quarter, that these are now comingled businesses relative to G&A costs, relative to sales rep/sales force advertising look into the business. It still has a Guilbert brand but it's an integrated way we go to market. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs - Analyst So Bruce, if I were to summarize what you said it sounds like most of the legacy Office Depot businesses to the extent you can measure those separately are up. It sounds like Guilbert on a comp basis so to speak might have been off a little bit. Is that fair? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman & CEO That's a fair statement. And that two big countries Guilbert had were France and the UK. So if they were off a bit compared to what they did before we owned them a year ago, then they have a pretty big impact on Guilbert in total. But in total the Guilbert -- we remain confident about delivering the plan we said we would and so far Guilbert has been -- met or exceeded virtually almost all of our plans. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs - Analyst Okay, thank you. Operator Mark Rowen. Mark Rowen - Prudential - Analyst Prudential. Good morning. A couple questions. Number one, on the catalog business you talked about doing some prospecting and things in Viking and some of those things didn't work out. It looks like you've been reducing circulation in the overall catalog business for the last couple of 13 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call years. Are you continuing to do that or are you now at a level of mailings where you're comfortable and are you going to start to increase that again? That's the first question. Second is on gross margin. You talked about in North American retail a 50 basis point drop year-over-year and you said that a lot of that was due to mix and selling more laptops and desktops. But can you give us a sense for this quarter and also, more importantly going forward, what kind of hit you're going to take from instituting the customer loyalty program because most companies that have instituted one have had, for the four quarters following that, a gross margin hit? Thanks. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman & CEO First of all, Mark, on the circulation plans, we don't break out whether we circulate existing customer books of prospects. We don't break that out separately nor do we plan to. Second, I don't think it's appropriate to talk about our circulation plans other than to say that they're focused, they're databased, they're driven, they're customer specific. We believe that we've got the right plan. When I said prospecting of Viking I want to clarify -- prospecting rates have declined. So it's the prospecting rate itself that's declined not prospecting per se. And I think that's a phenomenon that most cataloguers experience. As it relates to the 50 basis points mix change, again I want to emphasize that our core categories -- Chuck talked about them -- our core categories of furniture and core office supplies had basis point increases in margins in the first quarter. We anticipate they'll have the same in the second. And third, on the Advantage program, we do not think it's a material hit to margins. For one thing it's offset by some -- how we spend advertising dollars. And so to the extent that there is some margin hit, in our own analysis we'll offset that margin hit by lower advertising costs. So we don't see it a year from now being a hit on our margins. We just don't. Mark Rowen - Prudential - Analyst Okay. If I could just follow-up on the circulation. I wasn't really trying to get your exact plans, but I'm just trying to get a better sense because it seems like for the last couple of years sales have been down in the catalog business and your circulation has been down as well. Is that something that's continuing? Is that just a mature business that you're in basically every mailbox that you can get dollars out of? Or do you think you can grow that business by increasing circulation or in other ways? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman & CEO I think you can grow the business by selective circulation. The key to circulation, Mark, is cost to acquire. And cost to mail them, you do some analytics. And so the answer is we have not -- we are not focused on driving down catalog circulation as an objective. We're focusing on getting the right number of catalogs to the right customers at the right time and have response rate go up. There is a major element of the Viking businesses. This one of the reasons why Office Depot -- why Viking -- which is the side of the business I was on -- at the time merged with Office Depot. But Viking model matures. There is not as much maturity in the Office Depot model, that tends to be linked to our multibrand multichannel. So in summary we think our catalog businesses can and will grow. Mark Rowen - Prudential - Analyst One last question if I could to Charlie. When you acquired Guilbert last October I guess, or last year I think in October, you said you expected accretion of 12 to 15 cents and it sounds like that's still on schedule, did I read that right? Charlie Brown - Office Depot - CFO Yes, actually we acquired Guilbert on June 2nd. 14 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Mark Rowen - Prudential - Analyst But I think in October you talked about accretion of 12 to 15 cents. So is that still the range? Charlie Brown - Office Depot - CFO For the full year this year and that still holds. Mark Rowen - Prudential - Analyst Okay, great. Thank you. Operator Danielle Fox. Danielle Fox - Merrill Lynch - Analyst Merrill Lynch. a couple questions. First, just on the 11 percent technology comp, I'm wondering if the strength came from units or average selling prices and if it was both which do you think was the bigger contributor to the reacceleration? Chuck Rubin - Office Depot - EVP Merchandising and Marketing If I heard correctly the question was units and average selling price? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman & CEO Yes. Which caused the acceleration, units or average selling price? Chuck Rubin - Office Depot - EVP Merchandising and Marketing We actually had very good results on both fronts. We (technical difficulty) higher unit sales going out the door at higher average order values. Danielle Fox - Merrill Lynch - Analyst I'm having a little trouble hearing. The other question was just a few items on the outlook. I'm wondering what you're assuming for the tax rate as well as what your underlying assumptions about the impact from the currency will be over the next few quarters? Charlie Brown - Office Depot - CFO In terms of tax rate, the first-quarter tax rate was 30.5 percent. We think for the balance of the year it's going to be around 30 percent. We don't see any significant movement, maybe down a half a percent. In terms of currency the outlook is for the currency to stay at the Q1 levels which is, as you know, up over last year. 15 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Chuck Rubin - Office Depot - EVP Merchandising and Marketing Assuming that currency stays at the current level. That's our assumption and our go forward plans. If currencies fluctuate up or down from that it may or may not change our outlook, it depends on the materiality of it. But as best as we can understand currency is going to stay at or near these levels for the next nine months. Danielle Fox - Merrill Lynch - Analyst And just a final question is whether or not you have any updates on the anticipated net purchase price for the Kids 'R' Us stores given the PetCo deal for some of the locations? Charlie Brown - Office Depot - CFO Danielle, we're still in negotiations on some of these units. Obviously we're on track to get the 50 or 60 as announced to PetCo piece that others that are in the works. So it's moving along nicely. In terms of what it's going to net out at, we haven't completed that yet. Danielle Fox - Merrill Lynch - Analyst Generally coming down? Charlie Brown - Office Depot - CFO Absolutely. As you saw in the PetCo, PetCo was about 45 or 46 million off of the 196 that we announced. Danielle Fox - Merrill Lynch - Analyst Great, thank you. Operator Christopher DeBiase. Christopher DeBiase - Goldman Sachs - Analyst Most of my questions have been answered, but I just want to get one clarification. The 300 to 350 million of CAPEX this year, does that incorporate the necessary expenditures to reopen the 50 to 60 Kids 'R' Us stores that you've acquired? Charlie Brown - Office Depot - CFO No. The Kids 'R' Us are out of the number. So that's kind of our ongoing CAPEX in terms of the new stores, that does not include the Kids stores. Chuck Rubin - Office Depot - EVP Merchandising and Marketing It includes the new stores we will open outside of Kids, it includes our remodels, it includes all the other capital we plan to spend across the three business segments. It excludes the capital physically associated with Kids and the purchase price. As I said earlier, as we complete the actual 16 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call transaction with Kids on these sites and have a more specific store opening plan, then we can be much more clear about the capital and the impact of those as we go forward. Charlie Brown - Office Depot - CFO And one thing I would add to that, that's our outlook (technical difficulty) the 350. Go back over the past three or four years we have tended to underspend that in the tune of $50 to $75 million -- just as we pushed back on the return rates. Christopher DeBiase - Goldman Sachs - Analyst Great. Thanks for the clarification. Operator Aram Rubinson. Aram Rubinson - Banc of America - Analyst Actually I must have hit it twice, but since I'm here. I don't know whether this was Freudian slip or not when you said the toy stores that you acquired, if there are other stores out there on the horizon is it safe to say that you might still be interested in additional packages or do you think your plate if full? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman & CEO Well, first of all I meant toys own kids in their kid stores. With a side or two from anybody might be interesting. But a purchase of a block of stores is probably something we would not consider. I suppose there's always a case where a retailer vacates a site or two and you'll look at where it is, does it fit, you might take a set of blocks -- no, that's not in our current thinking today. Aram Rubinson - Banc of America - Analyst All right, thanks. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman & CEO Thanks for listening. Thanks for your questions. Our 10-Q should be available to you as we speak. We did file it today with our earnings release. It gives you far more insight into our business. Thanks you for your confidence and support.

We'd like to welcome you to the Office Depot second quarter 2004 earnings conference call. All lines will be on the listen-only mode for today's presensation. After which instruction will be given in order to ask a question. At the request of Office Depot today's conference is being recorded. I would like to introduce Mr. Sean McHugh, Director of Investor Relations, who will make a few opening comments. Mr. McHugh, you may now begin. Sean McHugh - Office Depot Inc. - IR Thank you, good morning.

Joining me today from Delray Beach are Charlie Brown, our CFO; Rick Lepley, our EVP of North American retail stores; and Chuck Rubin, EVP and Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer. Before I turn the call over to Charlie, I would like to quickly comment on our many second quarter achievements. Worldwide second quarter sales were 3.2 billion, up 12% year-over-year. Second quarter GAAP earnings per share was 25 cents, up 32% year-over-year. In the quarter we did record a 2 cent per share gain resulting from the settlement of certain commercial legal claims. Also in the second quarter of last year, we recorded a 3 cent gain from a foreign exchange benefit related to the Guilbert acquisition. That being said, we met the quarter's consensus estimates of 23 2 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call cents per share and increased our comparable second quarter earnings by 44%. Consolidated operating profit increased by 47% for the quarter to 120 million. For the first six months of 2004 operating profits were up 22% to $295 million. We recorded our second consecutive quarter of positive North American retail comps, up 3%, additional proof that we're moving in the right direction after 15 consecutive quarters of comp declines. We increased our second quarter North America retail segment operating profit by 54% to $71 million. I'm extremely proud of the cooperative efforts of our store operations, merchandising and marketing organizations, as well as those of our 24,000 retail employees who had a good quarter. By addressing both costs --both growth and costs they were able to deliver very strong results. As of mid-July we have virtually completed our technology remerchandising initiative in our North American retail stores. This is a continued effort to improve our sales and profitability in this category, as well as to further differentiate ourselves in the eyes of our customers. Chuck Rubin will give you more incite into this later in the call. In late June we launched our millenium 2, or M2 format with the opening of our Venice, Florida store. The improved format is intuitive, logical and designed specifically for the way that people make purchase decisions. In addition to the merchandising innovations we believe that this format will be less expensive to open and more efficient to operate. M2, both as a new and remodeled store format, represents a key element of our primary strategy of repositioning our North American real estate portfolio. Rick Lepley will discuss M2 in further detail later in the call. Local E-commerce sales grew by 22% to 742 million for the quarter. Domestic sales grew 12%. We are continuing our leadership position in this space and we remain on track to deliver 3 billion in online sales in 2004. In our North American business services group, the strategic realignment of our contract sales force is taking hold. Early results are encouraging and we expect the initiative to continue delivering growth to our delivery businesses. North America catalog sales accelerated during the second quarter compared to prior periods. Our international groups segment operating profit margin increased by approximately 60 basis points for the quarter, despite the addition of our lower gross margin Guilbert business. This performance is a tribute to the integration efforts of our European team and our outstanding European leadership position. We are focusing our efforts on restoring top line growth to our European contract business. Finally, we acquired the Hungarian business from one of our licensees and this acquisition now sets the stage for additional growth in eastern Europe. Those are the highlights of the second quarter performance. I'd now turn the call over to Charlie Brown, our CFO, who'll give you more incite both to the results for the company as well as comments within each business segment. Charlie. Charlie Brown - Office Depot Inc. - CFO Thanks Bruce, and good morning everyone. I would now like to share more incite into our second quarter performance. Total company sales for the first quarter grew by 12% to 3.2 billion compared to the second quarter of 2003. For the first six months of 2004, sales grew 15%. Worldwide comparable sales in our 925 stores and 80 delivery centers increased by 2%, both for the second quarter and first half of 2004. Local E-commerce sales increased 22% to 742 million in the quarter compared to the same period last year, further expanding our industry-leading position. Operating profit for the second quarter increased by 47% to 120 million, and by 22% to 298 million for the first half compared to the same period of 2003. Our profit increase primarily reflects improved North American retail comparable sales, the addition of Guilbert to our international group, lower BSG operating costs, and positive foreign currency impacts. General & administrative costs increased compared to the second quarter of last year, primarily as a result of consolidating Guilbert into our international group, the negative impact of translating international expenses from higher foreign currency rates and increased professional fees largely related to our efforts to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley. We currently anticipate spending fewer dollars in G&A during the second half 2004 than we spent last year. Second quarter GAAP earnings were 25 cents per diluted share compared with 19 cents for the same period last year. Included in the second quarter 2004 results was a 2 cent per share gain related to the settlement of certain claims associated with our European distribution system. Last year miscellaneous income included a 3 cent per share foreign exchange benefit related to the Guilbert acquisition. For the first half of 2004, GAAP net earnings per diluted share were 62 cents compared to 45 cents for the same period in 2003. Our 2003 results reflect the adoption of EITF-0216, which reduced diluted earnings per share by 8 cents for the first quarter. Our first quarter 2004 results included a 1cent per share cost related to settlement and outstanding legal claim. Now let's turn to the individual segment results. International group sales now represent 26% of our consolidated sales, grew 38% in local currencies, and 45% in U.S. dollars during the quarter. Second quarter revenues in U.S. dollars increased in all countries. Germany, the Netherlands, and Japan 3 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call experienced local currency declines. European catalog sales declined slightly, as continued improvement in the United Kingdom was offset by softness in our major European countries. Catalog sales in recently opened markets continued to show strong percentage growth and European comp sales were positive for the second consecutive quarter. Guilbert, while contributing strongly to our European earnings, experienced negative comparable sales in the quarter and year-to-date. In April we announced the acquisition of our licensed business in Hungary. This represents our first wholly-owned expansion into eastern Europe. The acquisition added 4 retail stores, a distribution center serving delivery customers, and additional Internet sales capabilities in our international group. International sales, when reported in U.S. dollars, benefited from stronger foreign exchange rates by $42 million in the second quarter and 123 million in the first half of 2004. Gross profit from the international group, as a percentage of sales, decreased by about 120 basis points in the second quarter of 2004; reflecting a higher mix of lower margin contract sales partially offset by better buying and increased purchasing discounts associated with our Guilbert acquisition. The increase in total store and warehouse operating and selling expenses reflect the addition of Guilbert, however, second quarter selling and warehouse expenses as a percentage of sales, excluding the gain I mentioned earlier, declined about 70 basis points compared to the prior year because of planned cost reductions and increased leverage from higher sales. International segment operating profit also benefited from the foreign exchange rates by $7 million during the quarter and by $20 million during the first six months compared to last year. This was another strong operating quarter for our international group, bolstered by our acquisition of Guilbert. Segment operating profit improved by about 60 basis points compared to last year, despite the increased mix of the lower gross margin contract business. Our integration efforts to capture cost synergies remain on play. We are now increasing our focus on driving top line growth from the transaction. For our North American business services group, total sales increased by 3% in the quarter. Contract sales also increased by 3%. Catalog sales remain soft but the trends are improving. Comp sales in our combined catalog businesses improved over 300 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year. We expect to see increasing benefits from the strategic realignment of our sales force and we expect our growth initiatives in the small and medium-size customer segments to take hold in the second half. Domestic E-commerce sales grew 12% during the quarter. We expect our worldwide E-commerce sales this year to exceed $3 billion. BSG's gross margins declined about 130 basis points in the second quarter, primarily because of the increased mix of large contract accounts and promotional activity in our catalog business. Our North American warehouses had another strong quarter with operating costs, as a percentage of sales, declining about 150 basis points compared to the same period last year. Payroll leverage contributed over two-thirds of that improvement. On an absolute basis, operating cost declined by $8 million quarter-over-quarter. Warehouse operating costs have declined in each of the past 13 quarters. These combined results generated a 5% increase in segment operating profit for the quarter or roughly a $4 million improvement over last year. BSG operating profits were up 2% for the first half of the year as well. And finally, our North America retail business. Total sales increased 5% to 1.5 billion in the quarter. Comparable sales increased 3%, our second conservative quarter of positive comps. The increase in comparable sales was primarily attributable to improved sales of technology products which was a direct result of several technology initiatives launched during the second half of 2003. Comparable technology sales increased 18% for the quarter and 15% year-to-date. Comp sales in our furniture group increased 4% for the quarter and 6% year-to-date, in part a reflection of the success of our Christopher Lowell line of products. Our aggregate furniture and other category recorded a comp sales decline of 2% for the quarter and year-to-date. Core office supplies year-to-date largely because of the strong comparison to sales from the 2003 launch of Inc. Depot, which drove positive comparable retail sales last June. Average transaction size increased for the second quarter and first half, while comparable transactions declined in both periods. During the quarter the company opened 1 retail store. At the end of the second quarter we operated a total of 901 office product superstores throughout North America. Rick Lepley, our EVP of North American retail, will provide additional color related to our 2004 retail outlook later in the call. Increases in sales of technology products, which generally have lower margins, adversely affected gross profit as a percentage of sales during the quarter. This decline was offset by reduced strength and occupancy costs compared to the second quarter of last year. Gross margin percentages in core office supplies and furniture categories increased in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. Second quarter store and warehouse expenses declined by 100 basis points compared to last year, primarily because of continued payroll leverage and lapping higher operating costs associated with the 2003 launch of Inc. Depot. Our retail payroll was almost 60 basis lower in the quarter than last year. This is after absorbing 4 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call almost a penny a share for the initial merchandising of our technology category. Segment operating increased 54% in the second quarter representing a 25 million, and 170 basis points, improvement over last year. I would now like to briefly share some of our balance sheet and cash flow metrics for the total company. Our cash and short-term investments exceeded $1 billion at the end of second quarter, down just slightly from the first quarter. Inventory levels declined by 90 million from last year to $1.17 billion, reflecting continuing improvements by our supply chain. North American contract DSO was flat with second quarter last year, however at 42 days, it declined sequentially from 46 days in the first quarter. Year-to-date, capital expenditures sit at $168 million. Year-to-date free cash flow was $140 million. We recorded a 30% effective tax rate and we expect that rate to remain relatively stable for the balance of the year. Based on improved visibility into the impact of the Kids 'R' Us transaction, we have updated several financial metrics for the balance of 2004. These include free cash flow of 300 to 350 after considering the impact of KRU. And capital expenditures in the 400 to $450 million range. And inventory levels flat -- virtually flat after opening 80 new retail stores. Now, as many of you know, we recently opened our first M2 store in Venice, Florida. This new store format will be used for all new and remodeled stores from this point forward. I'd like to turn the call over to Rick Lepley who will provide some insights into this and other important initiatives in our retail division. Rick Lepley - Office Depot Inc. - EVP-North American Retail Stores Thanks Charlie. Good morning everyone. Let me start by highlighting some of our retail achievements for the first half of the year. First, our retail segment operating profits were up 54% for the second quarter and 12% for the first half of the year. Our positive comp sales, expense control, and lower strength all contributed to this improvement. And as Charlie indicated, we reduced comparable payroll by continuing to manage our full-time, part-time employee mix and by controlling our hourly wage rate increases. We reduced our comparable shrink rate over last year through the use of electronic product tagging and improved employee training. Our shrink rates remain well below industry averages. Profits earned by our underperforming stores, in other words the bottom 20% of the stores in our portfolio, improved by over 50% compared to last year. As you may or may not know we reorganized North American retail and this improvement can be attributed to that reorganization and to the application of dedicated management resources to this opportunity. And finally, we have measurably improved the profitability of our Canadian stores. This was also part of the reorganization of North American retail in that we have now dedicated operational and merchandising management in that region. Talk a little bit about M2. Our first M2 format store opened in Venice on June 30th. And that was the same day that we hosted a launch event from our prototype store near our headquarters here in Delray Beach. Members of the media and the financial community, in fact many of you on this call, were able to come to visit with us that day and to learn more about our new format. Overall reaction from our visitors was very, very positive and quite encouraging. As we outlined the design of M2 and it's intended economic and customer-oriented benefits, people showed genuine excitement about this differentiated store format. In terms of the early results we're happy to share with you that the Venice M2 is exceeding our expectations on every level and every metric. In fact, it's so far over our expectations, that we're anxious to get some more and I would caution you that obviously this is just one store, and as we are able to open more of these or get through our remodels, we'll have data points in our composite to better evaluate the project's overall performance. For those of you that have not seen the M2 format, let me describe some of the key attributes. From a merchandising and operation perspective, a great many elements are different from our standard store profile. As you enter you'll notice groupings of products in horseshoe pods around the perimeter of the store. These pods are visible from almost any vantage point and allow customers to quickly orient themselves and find the products that they need. The pods also facilitate viewing of entire categories simply by standing in front of the pod, a huge win that allows us to gain visibility for entire categories in a more prominent way. In the middle of the store is our technology section displayed on 60 inch gondola. This provides the customer with a very clear view of the entire store, our products, our signs and our employees. It also allows our employees to see our customers, enabling prompt customer service and a more efficient labor model. We've increased other holding power at the point of sale by using high steel on the outer walls with increased shelf depth. This improved holding power on the floor reduces customer perceives out of stock as well as a number of employee product touches. We've also increased our use of bulk stacks for high velocity items. This reinforces our brand value statement and also reduces labor. And we've also cut the number of peg hooks in the the store by 50%, further reducing our labor allocation away from the products and toward the customer. From a packaging perspective, 5 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call we have moved in the direction of display ready trays. This minimizes stocking and zone recovery labor. When possible, we have also implemented gravity fed and string loaded bins to keep products organized and out in front of the customer. And finally, our graphics package uses more prominent photos of products highlighted on a warm, differentiated color pallette. This allows our customers to more easily find our products using visual cues from all over the store and the color creates a warm and inviting environment that clearly differentiates us from our competitors. On the financial side, we expect the M2 remodel costs to be lower than those experienced in our original millenium format. I think they'll come in about 250 to $300,000, versus 350 to $400,000 in the M1. Now this creates a much lower sales hurdle to achieve our cost to capital and allows us to remodel a greater percentage of our chain. And we also expect that the new store buildouts will be much lower utilizing this format. In terms of store labor we expect to use the operational labor savings to either reallocate labor hours to more customer-centric activities or to eliminate the hours, as appropriate. I'll take a minute now to give you a quick recap of where we are in the KRU transaction. Back in March we announced our agreement to acquire 124 sites for $197 million. In the same month we agreed to sell 20 of these sites to Petco for $45 million. We began the closing process on retail sites in early May. At the end of the second quarter we had closed on only 25 locations, behind where we had initially planned. However in the past several weeks we have seen acceleration in site closings, even though we are still behind our original plan. To date, an additional 15 stores have been removed from the transaction by mutual agreement. Given where we are today the comparable transaction value has now been reduced from 197 million to a forecasted value of about $120 million. While we plan on closing the remaining properties over the second half of 2004, these delays have caused us to adjust our new store count for the second half. We now expect to open an additional 80 new M2 format stores during the remainder of 2004. Approximately 40 of which are the KRU sites acquired in the Toys R Us deal. The majority of these 40 locations will be in the northeast. This number may fluctuate slightly depending on the timing of the closings from the KRU deal as each site is closing on an individual basis. In terms of how we are scheduling the opening of the 80 stores, we're looking at opening approximately 30 stores in the third quarter with the balance falling in the fourth quarter. Finally, our M2 remodel program will now consist of approximately 40 stores in the second half of the years. We plan on remodeling several more during the third quarter but we've put it on hold at the request of our store managers during the back to school season. So we're going to take a pause of about four weeks an then resume the remodel program. Because of this you should expect most of the M2 remodels to occur in the fourth quarter this year. Another point regarding our remodels. By utilizing new partnerships and new processes, we've reduced our expected average remodel time by 50%. This will minimize customer disruption and reduce any potential negative sales impacts that can sometimes occur in a remodel. To conclude I would say that we are encouraged by what our focus groups, market research and live customers are now telling us about the M2 format. We encourage each analyst, investor, and anyone listening on this call to come to visit one of our new stores as soon as they become visible in your individual market. Now I would like to turn the call over to Chuck Rubin. Chuck Rubin - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer Thanks Rick. Good morning everybody. Let me begin by highlighting two key points about North American retail. First, the continued execution of our key merchandising strategies resulted in a second consecutive quarter of positive comp sales. Technology and furniture were the biggest contributors to the growth, with 18 % and 4% comps respectively. Second, we increased our retail gross margin dollars over the prior year for the second consecutive quarter. Our gross margin rate improved quarter-over-quarter in most non-technology product categories. However, the higher growth rate of technology products created a mix shift that caused the overall margin rate to decline. Now for some specific category information, beginning with technology. Computer sales drove our comp performance. Desktops and our best-in-class, build-to-order both performed well. Notebooks, which deliver higher margin, also saw significant increases and contributed a higher percentage of our total computer business. This is in line with our strategic focus on mobility products. Software and technology services, both higher margin businesses, also experienced solid increases. We continued to implement initiatives intended to boost the sales of higher margin technology items as well as to improve attachment rates of supply items. Our technology remerchandising initiative, which you've heard about, is nearing completion in all planned stores. This reset involves improvement product adjacencies of add-on, higher margin items, intended to increase the size of our market basket. Also, a redesigned sign package provides an improved directory of product information to help better inform our customers. We believe this will help drive trade up sales of better spec high margin items. To complete the 6 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call rollout we anticipate a 1 to 2 cent impact of additional costs in Q3. We have also instituted sales incentive programs to reward our associates for better attachment selling. Early test results from each of these programs are encouraging. Turning to our other product categories, furniture sales, as you heard, improved year-over-year led by a strong performance from our exclusive Christopher Lowell furniture collections. Overall gross margins benefited from both the higher sales volume and improved gross margin rates. Supplies experienced flat gross margin dollars as significantly higher gross margin rates were offset by a decline in overall category sales. As you've heard, I'd remind you again that our performance was up against a very strong initial launch of Inc. Depot and other supply initiatives that occurred in second quarter of 2003. Now let's review BSG. BSG merchanidising sales improved all across all major product divisions. Furniture and technology turned in the best relative performances, but increased sales of supplies contributed the most to the overall dollar improvement. Supplies did well across categories in BSG. They performed exceptionally well in contract with comp sales up across almost every supply category. BSG gross margin dollars declined slightly in the second quarter compared to last year due to a higher mix of large contract customers and increased promotional activity in our catalog and Office Depot E-commerce channels. Now I'd like to give you some insight into our current merchandising initiatives. Private brand penetration as a percentage of our sales increased in the second quarter to 13%. During the quarter we improved the design, quality and packaging of our Office Depot paper products. We also expanded our successful Christopher Lowell brand with new accessories. Finally which expanded our private brand efforts with a new label introduction into the writing instruments category. On the global purchasing front we worked more closely than ever with our international counterparts to further combine our worldwide purchasing efforts. We successfully achieved lower costs on all product categories addressed, during both this quarter and the year-to-date. In the area of pricing, we continued our North American retail category pricing review. This review was and is intended to ensure that we are remaining competitive in the marketplace while optimizing our margin expansion opportunities. This effort positively contributed to our Q2 financial performance. Moving onto our Magellan project. A reminder that we are now just past the halfway point of the 31 month implementation. Our team's hard work has ensured that the program remains on time and on budget. Modules now in place across the chain have given us improved planning and forecasting capabilities. To be more specific, these new capabilities allowed us to complete the M2 layout and planogram in less time than previously needed and in a much more analytical manner that leveraged performance data. Magellan has provided us the capability to better manage our inventory. Our Q2 turnover improved compared to last year and, furthermore, we anticipate opening our 80 new stores this fall with no significant incremental inventory to our last year levels. As we look to Q3 and Q4, Magellan will go live with additional functionally in the areas of assortment, pricing and merchandising. Let me quickly recap some of our advertising initiatives. As we said on our last earnings call we continue to focus on rationalizing our overall marketing spend. Second quarter spending levels were lower than those in the first quarter, furthermore we expect overall 2004 ad spend to be lower than 2003 levels on a comp store basis. This pull back is consistent with our plan to improve our overall marketing effectiveness by spending only on those vehicles that drive sales returns. An example of our progress in this area is the higher in store productivity that we achieved this quarter. By taking a more analytical approach to space allocation, we are ensuring that product categories earn their way into the Sunday circular. Finally, an update on the Advantage loyalty program. Our membership numbers over 1.5 million customers a figure above our initial plan for this time frame. Member spending patterns continue to be attractive and, furthermore, we have achieved a critical mass of members to support the development of targeted marketing campaigns which we expect to launch in the near future. I told you where we've been now let me give our view of what's ahead of us. We will continue to expand our penetration of private brand across all channels. With our organizational structure now in place, we plan on increasing our volumes significantly over the next few years. We will continue to seek margin improvement opportunities through both increased global purchasing programs and other targeting initiatives including our retail pricing efforts. We will continue to offer a product and service assortment that is both differentiated from our competition and squarely focused on customers needs. The introduction of product from both Apple and IBM over the past few weeks is a prime example. Additionally, our recently launched technology recycling program, which we are offering in conjunction with HP, is the first nationwide free recycling program. This effort is being greeted with huge enthusiasm from our customers and reinforces our corporate values. 7 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call We will continue our efforts to optimize our marketing spend. The analytical processes will be refined and applied to additional areas to ensure that we are earning a return on our investment. And we look forward to our sponsorship efforts for next month's summer Olympic in Athens. We are extremely proud to be affiliated with such a high profile and global event. And critical to all of the above, we will continue the focus established last quarter on the improved execution of our merchandising and marketing initiatives. Finally, while we have seen a slight softening in our recent sales, we remain confident in our strategies and our ability to carry them out. With that I'd like to turn the call back over to Bruce. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot Inc. - Chairman and CEO Thanks, Chuck, Rick and Charlie. I'll quickly summarize and turn the call over to all of you for questions. We continue to execute against our seven key strategic initiatives and our efforts are delivering tangible and measurable results. Let me quickly remind all of you of those seven key strategic points. Grow our people, talent and leadership. Reposition our North American real estate portfolio. Control costs while enhancing quality. Create a customer-centric experience. Develop differentiated product assortments. Excel in Europe. And build or acquire to generate break-through growth. On each of those initiatives, we made significant strides in the second quarter. I am confident that our leadership team and our nearly 50,000 global employees will continue and are continuing to press forward to deliver value for our shareholders and our customers. Now I would like to turn the call over to you for questions you might have and further insight you'd like on our second quarter performance and our outlook for the remainder of 2004. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Operator Thank you. We are now ready to begin the question and answer session. [Caller Instructions] One moment for the first question. Matthew Fassler, your line is open. Please state your company name. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs - Analyst Thanks so much and thanks for your comments this morning. A couple of questions. First of all, on the expense line, you took your expense dollars down in both of your domestic businesses as you discussed. Can you tell us whether they are cost pressures abating or was all of this internally driven and how sustainable do you think dollar cost declines are as you look forward into the second half? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot Inc. - Chairman and CEO Thanks, Matt, for the question. The answer is these are internally driven. These are our metrics, our focuses. Cost came out of our BSG business, I think now, for 13 or 14 consecutive quarters. We've said we'll continue to improve with that and we are and we will. Cost came out of our retail business because of a tight focus on payroll, some leverage on our sales volume; and we anticipate continued ability to manage our costs effectively in both those key business segments. We also had cost improvement in Europe too, x out the impact of the addition of Guilbert. It fits one of our core strategies which is to control cost while enhancing quality. And with just a fanatical focus on making sure we do that and we believe they are sustainable. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs - Analyst Gotcha. Second question if I could. Could you talk through the math of getting from the original 197 million cost of the Kids deal down to 120, just in terms of-- you don't have to get that specific, but what are the basic items in terms of stores and any other costs that reduced that purchase price. 8 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Bruce Nelson - Office Depot Inc. - Chairman and CEO Matt, I'm going to ask Charlie to answer that question for you. Charlie Brown - Office Depot Inc. - CFO Okay, Matt. I don't have the numbers in front of me specifically, but I'll give you, kind of, the broad outline. The 197 million was the announced value of the transaction. We sold to Petco, I think it was around 45 million. So you have to X that off. We've had about 12 to $14 million of units that have been pulled out of the deal that was by mutual agreement. And then we have about probably about 30 --no probably $20 million of stores that we're holding we're actually actively marketing that we're holding for resale. Then you've got to add to that some small amounts for broker fees, et cetera, and that's kind of the broad strokes on the math. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs - Analyst So, it's just your divesture of some of the stores that you're not going to hold on to that takes that down. Charlie Brown - Office Depot Inc. - CFO That was always the case, Matt. We always -- even when we were first looking through transactions said between 50 and 60 out of the 124 sites. So we've always had plans-- Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs - Analyst Sure. Understood. My final question. You spoke to some softness at Guilbert in the second quarter and the first half overall. You've given some guidance to higher sales overseas in the second half. Can you talk about whether, in local currency terms, Guilbert got better or worse Q2 over Q1 one and just what's in your second half assumption overseas. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot Inc. - Chairman and CEO Guilbert quarter-over-quarter got a little better. Wasn't quite as negative as the first quarter comparably. Two things going on there. One is we exited some Guilbert businesses we acquired by intent. Business in Italy, some retail businesses in Germany, furniture business in the Netherlands. So have to like for like that. On a like for like basis, the second quarter was a slight improvement in rate, albeit below last year, than the first. We anticipate some improvement in those rates in the second half. Still think now that the Guilbert business is likely to trend negative through most of the year. We are focusing on growth initiatives there. That's predominantly been a cultural issue. The Guilbert sales force has really been focused on account profitability, short-term take advantage of account profitability and not focus the resources and the sales rep in growth. We're adding to the sales rep count in Europe as we speak and we believe we can get the Guilbert business to grow positively. We're up against a couple tough economies in Europe. By anything you read you would argue that France and Germany, in particular, are two tough economic environments and we're heavily positioned in France and in have a significant position in Germany. But, got a little better, to answer your question, and we think it will get better throughout the year. Although, it's still likely to trend negative on a like for like basis through most of the second half. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs - Analyst Thanks so much. 9 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Operator Danielle Fox your line is open please state your company name. Danielle Fox - Merrill Lynch - Analyst Merrill Lynch, thank you. Two questions. First, you mentioned that June and July were a bit softer than you'd hoped--North American retail. I'm wondering if that was across the board from a product perspective? And so what are some of the key things that you're doing differently this year heading into back to school. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot Inc. - Chairman and CEO Two answers to that question. One -- and the softness occurred predominantly in Inc. as we compared against a very aggressive Inc. Depot rollout a year ago. And, on a purely dollar basis, softness in paper. Units were stronger than the dollars in retail, but some softness in paper. As it relates to back to school we basically launch the key initiatives this Sunday and I would just summarize by saying without the specificity that we're confident this will be our best back to school product assortment, our advertising and marketing spend, and coordination with all channels of our business. So we really launch it in a significant way this coming Sunday. Danielle Fox - Merrill Lynch - Analyst Okay. And thank you. The second question is just how your filling the real estate pipeline for more aggressive northeast expansion outside of the Kids 'R' Us stores that you've already acquired. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot Inc. - Chairman and CEO Well, as Rick talked about earlier, we're on track to open 80 new stores in the next 5 months. We anticipate next year that we could be in the 100 to 120 range. Our plan all along was to open 100 this year. It's the delays of the Toys stores that have caused us, probably, to be in the 80 range. We'll add that to the opening store count--new stores in 2005. And the answer is we are continuing to fill in in those important markets to Office Depot. We've talked a lot about adding density here in south Florida and we continue to do that. Without being specific in other markets our expansion goes beyond the northeast. Obviously, as we go forward in the next couple of years, a large percentage of the new store openings will occur in that region. But we will continue to open stores in the geographies where we have a strong density where we can fill in and keep the kind of market share and presence we want to have in our retail business. So, we're pretty optimistic about our ability to open that number of stores. We've got an awful lot of sites already either signed or committed to for 2005, so I don't think that number is much as risk. And we're now looking at 2006 and beyond at where we put stores. Remember these are smaller stores on average. I mean, on average, we're going to be looking at 17,000 square feet of--17,500 of selling space. So, while we're adding store count, we are not adding proportional square footage growth and we feel confident, based on both the initial returns or the results of this; which Rick said are exceeding our wildest expectations, albeit it's one store. We believe that we can generate the return on capital and establish a significant presence in the geographies we're not in. And we remain highly optimistic about our ability to do that. Danielle Fox - Merrill Lynch - Analyst Thank you. 10 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Operator Bill Sims your line is open state your company name. Bill Sims - Smith Barney - Analyst Morning. Smith Barney. Two quick questions. One, can you give us just some additional color on what's causing the severance cost related to your French warehouse to jump significantly compared to initial expectations? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot Inc. - Chairman and CEO Could you repeat the question, you chopped up a little bit. I think you had a question regarding the severance cost in the French warehouse. Bill Sims - Smith Barney - Analyst That's correct. It seems like relative to your initial plan severance costs for the warehouse are jumping up fairly materially can you just comment what changed since your initial plan? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot Inc. - Chairman and CEO Certainly I can. First of all, I remind all of you if you don't know the environment in France, any decisions you come to about pulling you facilities require the agreement of explicit agreement of workers councils. With the addition of Guilbert we have many more than one council. Two is, we've always had historically, it goes back to the Viking days a very large warehouse just outside of Paris. Historically, we have had very challenging labor environments in that warehouse. In fact, in the last two or three years, we've had multiple strikes. It's a difficult workforce. It's difficult to find the kind people outside of Paris that want to work in warehouses. It's caused our cost and operating costs to often be higher than we wanted to live with. We plan to move that warehouse and put into our plan what we anticipated the costs might be to come to agreement with the workers councils. We finally reached agreement in July. That cost us more than we anticipated. But the net result is we plan on opening now-- and will open in the first half of next year, a large warehouse about 60 or 70 miles from France -- Paris excuse me. Lower cost to operate, more efficient with, we think, a much more harmonious workforce. And so, in conjunction with the discussions with the multiple workers councils, we agreed to a severance period of time and the cost associated with the people to make that happen. It was higher than we anticipated but, in our judgement, clearly positions us better to perform better in France and avoid the costly disruptions we've had in the last couple of years as a result of labor issues. Bill Sims - Smith Barney - Analyst Thank you. And one more quick question. It's a housekeeping question. Do you have the diluted shares outstanding for the end of the second quarter. I didn't see it in the release. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot Inc. - Chairman and CEO I am sorry I didn't hear it. Bill Sims - Smith Barney - Analyst Diluted shares outstanding. 11 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Charlie Brown - Office Depot Inc. - CFO 317. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot Inc. - Chairman and CEO About 317 million. Bill Sims - Smith Barney - Analyst Thank you very much. Operator Dan Binder your line is open. Please state your company name. Dan Binder - Buckingham Research - Analyst Hi, it's Dan Binder at Buckingham. Couple questions for you. You mentioned that, I guess, the majority of the retail margin was really driven by the mix. I am curious if paper pricing played into that at all. You mentioned that paper had softened a bit. Is that a function of Office Depot trying to take price up and competitors not. Is that playing into this at all and then my second question was, I guess, given your comparable transactions still being down slightly, what do you think you need to do to really start to drive traffic and is M2 the answer to that or does it go beyond that? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot Inc. - Chairman and CEO Dan, good questions. I am going to have Chuck answer both of those. I may have a comment, a tailing comment on transactions. But, Chuck if you'd take the paper question and the comp transaction one. Chuck Rubin - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer Yeah. Good morning Dan. The paper question, there have been cost increases as we talked about, I think, in our last call. We have managed those as aggressively as we could. We have been able to pass on many of those increases to our customer. We believe we are still competitively priced. We are in as good a position as we believe we can be in from a competitive standpoint both in the costs that we're paying. We are not on allocation for product and we believe that generally we are retail competitive in our retail pricing. It continues to be a bit of a dicey marketplace as we are looking into the next couple of quarters but, again, I'd reinforce that we feel comfortable, as comfortable as we can be with where we are from a competitive standpoint. As far as the traffic is concerned and actions that we're taking, I talked before about marketing effectiveness and one of the things that we're measuring is-- from an analytical standpoint is certainly sales and margins but traffic counts. We're trying to build a program of marketing vehicles that drive sales, as well as traffic, into our retail stores. So as we go forward for the back half of this year we've made adjustments in our marketing spend to do just that. We also believe that as M2 rolls out with the additional stores that there's an up swing to that for those stores impacted. 12 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Bruce Nelson - Office Depot Inc. - Chairman and CEO Just add to that, Dan. Just a reminder all of you, it is about our portfolio and we've talked an awful lot about it. But 75% of our North American stores are more than 5 years old and we've virtually not remodeled those stores in the past few years that does impact comps and transactions. Second of all, by intent over the last three years, the majority of our new stores have gone into the heart of existing Office Depot territory. Building stores out in California, Texas and south Florida where we then take hits on our own transactions. We cannibalize ourselves. We think that all the customer feedback that we've gotten on M2 and the one store would tell us that we can drive comps back with a better differentiated store format, and coupled with what Chuck said about differentiated product and service offerings and better allocation of advertising spend; we're confident we can get transactions to turn positive. Dan Binder - Buckingham Research - Analyst Just a couple follow-ups to that. On the gross margin at retail, while I guess it was up 70 basis points, it was probably up less than some expected. Can you quantify what the impact for accrual on the Advantage program may have had, if it was material, or was this just strictly a technology mix issue? And then the second question was, do you expect the catalog business as it continues to shift to Internet does it really pay to promote catalog aggressively at the cost of margin or just sort of redirect those promotions towards shifting that business to Internet? Charlie Brown - Office Depot Inc. - CFO Dan, it is Charlie. I'll take the gross margin. The gross margin was very much a mix issue where as we -- the margins were up in all the categories but obviously mixing much more heavily into technology brought the overall number down. We did have accruals for the Advantage program but those were anticipated opened in our guidance and we're in line with that. So that program is not a runaway train. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot Inc. - Chairman and CEO Dan, virtually all of the supply categories had nice margin increases across most categories in retail. We've said that would occur all along and it did. It is a mix issue. Chuck's got a comment he'd like to make as well. Chuck Rubin - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer Yeah, just to add to that on the supplies. To Bruce's point, supply category margin rates were up. The same is true for furniture as well. That contributed at a higher rate. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot Inc. - Chairman and CEO To your second question regarding the allocation--really what you're asking about how is how do you allocate the cost to acquire cost. Do you do it through catalogs, do you do it through online and the different choices you make. And Chuck spoke to, without going into a lot of depth, how we're focused on making our advertising dollars more effective. We call catalogs advertising dollars and we have reallocated how we're spending those catalog dollars to be more effective to lower our cost to acquire and get a better lifetime value as a result of that acquisition and we'll continue to see efforts in that regard. It is one of the reasons why Chuck spoke earlier about our confidence that we can continue to leverage our advertising expense and we'll end up in 2004 with a lower expense percentage than we had in 2003. Dan Binder - Buckingham Research - Analyst I guess what I am getting at is it just seems like the catalog business as it migrates to the Internet is a business that I guess I would never think could get back to positive. I mean is this a business that we should just kind of -- you know, under invest in and really just focus the efforts on E-commerce 13 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call rather than --it sounded like earlier you said that you had done some promotions to help drive the catalog business. I'm just trying to understand the logic behind that. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot Inc. - Chairman and CEO First, we don't share your view that the businesses can't get back to positive. We're confident that the catalog businesses can. I think the Viking segment of the catalog business may have more challenges to get more positive as it focuses on such a very small specific customer niche. And that's one where we maximize the opportunity to leverage a highly profitable positive cash business. But -- and certainly there's cannibalization to the Internet, but even if you look at our E-commerce sales, a significant portion of our customers are entering sku numbers that they could only get through catalogs. So they go hand in hand. But we believe and we saw Office Depot catalog sales, as we talked early, accelerate during the second quarter. We anticipate that Office Depot catalog sales will be positive in the second half of the year. Dan Binder - Buckingham Research - Analyst Great. Thanks. Operator Colin McGranahan your line is open please state your company name. Colin McGranahan - Sanford Bernstein - Analyst Sanford Bernstein. First question's just a quick follow up on catalog. Obviously, you've said it's encouraging and some acceleration; can you give us a sense of where those sales are on a same customer basis now? Maybe what you've seen in some of the tests that you've performed and just, you know, what the difference is in trends between the Viking catalog and the Office Depot catalog right now? Just so we can get a better sense of where you are and where you're going. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot Inc. - Chairman and CEO Our retention rate on Viking is strong. Our growth in existing customers is good. The Viking challenge has been acquiring new customers. That continues to be a challenge in an acceptable cost to acquire lifetime value formula. That's not new news. I mean, frankly, it goes back to one of the base reasons why Office Depot and Viking decided to get together in 1998; because that model does have some aspects of challenges to it, both domestically and internationally where you see similar characteristics. On the Office Depot catalog side, a little bit of the same, our real challenge has been acquiring new customers. It would appear that we're doing a relatively good job of holding the loyal customers, the ones that buy from us more than once. One of the many challenges we've all had in Internet marketing is getting a one time customer to become a multiple buy customer. That has been a challenge. That speaks back to the reallocation of effort. So we look at Viking as a little more mature catalog model which will focus on retention and growing share of our existing customer base and a little less aggressive on quoting new customers. And on the Office Depot we'll reallocate resources to get more aggressive on the allocation of new customers using the most effective media to do that with. Some of which might be mailing catalogs and some might be Internet; blending those two things together. And we think we can grow and have got some encouraging signs on the depot side that we're growing new customers. 14 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Colin McGranahan - Sanford Bernstein - Analyst Okay, and then just drilling down into the North American retail gross margin a little bit more. Could you quantify for us what that technology mix impact was and how much shrink improved? Just so we get a sense of how much you're improving and then how much the mix is impacting that. Any kind of quantification of that would be very helpful. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot Inc. - Chairman and CEO Well, the answer to your question is that the absolute reported margins is virtually mix related with some improvement in shrink. To get more specific than that, I don't think is meaningful. What you have to take away is that virtually across most major supply categories our margins increased. That's by the way a quarter increase. We had the same impact in the first quarter. Furniture margins increased. So we're getting margin increases and you can say virtually all of the delta between second quarter this year and second quarter last year is mix related with some improvement in shrink. To remind all of you, a year ago in the second quarter we rolled out Inc. Depot. We had a significant in revenue, but we also talked to you about a significant increase in shrink. In the third quarter last year we said we would address shrink by electronic devices and other kinds of choices. We have begun to do that. We took our inventories in retail in the second quarter this year and trued up our estimate for shrink versus our actual shrink and we brought shrink levels down from historically high levels a year ago to something higher than they were prior to the rollout of Inc. Depot, but still, we believe, industry leading shrink rates. And so it's a mix issue. Our core business is doing well. Well into margins and we anticipated. Chuck talked about private label. It's a growing aspect of our retail business and we'll grow it further. That means better margins. Chuck talked about pricing initiatives. Some of which was instituted and relatively unsophisticated tools and Magellan gives us many more sophisticated tools to make sure we're competitive and to make sure that we achieve rates. So we're confident about our ability to grow margins. Colin McGranahan - Sanford Bernstein - Analyst Okay. But they would have been up a lot more, right, without the mix impact? Unless I'm looking at something fundamentally wrong, you gross margin rate was up right in North American retail. Charlie Brown - Office Depot Inc. - CFO The rates are up. Colin McGranahan - Sanford Bernstein - Analyst Right, I mean, even including the mix impact; so we're just trying to get a sense of what the rate would have been up without that mix impact. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot Inc. - Chairman and CEO The answer is we don't have that calculation at hand. We can try to go offline. Colin McGranahan - Sanford Bernstein - Analyst Okay, we'll take if offline. I don't want to take more time. 15 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Bruce Nelson - Office Depot Inc. - Chairman and CEO I would like to answer but we just don't have it at hand. Operator Mark Rowen your line is open. Please state your company name. Mark Rowen - Prudential - Analyst Thank you Prudential. Couple of questions, sort of follow-up questions. One, on the softness in North American retail, you talked about it softening in the last few weeks. Some other retailers and sectors began to feel that softness in May and June actually improved. It sounds like you started feeling it a little bit later and it is continuing. I wonder if you could just confirm that? And is the softness-- do you get the sense that it's consumers pulling on big ticket purchases like computers and technology or is it just less traffic overall in the stores? My second question is on North American catalog, you talked about promotional activity, I wonder if you could just talk-- or give us a little bit more detail about what that promotional activity is? Are you responding to competitors or is this activity you need to generate new customers or activity you need to keep your current customers buying more? Thanks. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot Inc. - Chairman and CEO Sure. Chuck. Chuck Rubin - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer I'll address the first part of the question talking about the performance of North American retail. Our -- based on other retailers results our sales softened a little bit later than others. On the most recent weeks-- actually to go back to a couple of your comments. We are not seeing any softness in larger ticket purchases. So our technology sales continue to be strong. What we have seen is a softening somewhat due to a marketing shift. We changed our back to school marketing campaign. Bruce alluded to it earlier. For all intents and purposes, that campaign really kicks off this weekend. So that shift in money which ties back to our marketing effectiveness effort has resulted in a slight softening in our retail sales over the past couple of weeks. As many of you know, the back to school season is a rolling schedule depending on what part of the country that you're in. But, we are still feeling comfortable that August, with everything that we have aligned will be a very strong back to school period. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot Inc. - Chairman and CEO As it relates to the promotional activity in catalogs a significant portion of that was related to paper and we think that is in response to competitive activity, not being aggressive in the competitive activity. So, the promotional impact was predominantly focused in paper during the second quarter. That always takes place when you get paper price increases from mills, it takes a while for that to roll through the channel. And depending on your inventory position, some are more aggressive, less aggressive. And, frankly, you can't afford to loose share in paper. That's such a core commodity and core item for our customer base. So it was predominantly paper related and it was in response to competitor pressures. We're going to take one more call and then if we haven't answered all your questions feel free to call us after the all and we'll give you further insight. So one more question. Operator Michael Baker your line is open. Please state your company name. 16 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Michael Baker - Deutsche Banc - Analyst Thanks. Deutsche Banc. Couple follow-up questions and then one new question. Just wanted to go back on what you spoke about in the catalog where it sounded like if you are not picking up new customers and you said retention is good and the growth in existing customers is good. Well, if the overall business was down, so one of those--unless I'm missing something would have had to have been down. Is it that retention is good but you are losing some customers or the growth isn't as strong or-- I was just a little confused by that. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot Inc. - Chairman and CEO Well, let me clarify and try to be more clear with what I said. Was I said--was asked the question response to our catalog business and what the dynamics of it. Our retention has been and always been strong with Viking. The challenge has been for some time, not the last quarter or two, acquiring new customers. We -- in the second quarter, our new customer acquisition rates in the Depot catalog business improved and that led to a better performance in the catalog business and we are optimistic and hopeful that based on how we're allocating spend, cost to acquire and lifetime value, that we will accelerate new customer growth in the catalog business. That's predominantly what we saw in the second quarter on the Depot side of the business. Michael Baker - Deutsche Banc - Analyst Then spending from existing customers, is that -- where does that relate to a year ago? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot Inc. - Chairman and CEO Generally speaking, it's up. Michael Baker - Deutsche Banc - Analyst Okay. I'll think about that a little more. Then, last question, can you explain you spoke about reorganization of North American retail and how that helped to improve the bottom 20% of your stores by 50 %. So what are some of the things that you've done in those stores to turn that around? And what's the continuing opportunity there? Rick Lepley - Office Depot Inc. - EVP-North American Retail Stores Well, for example, we had nobody in Canada in charge of Canada and about four months ago we appointed a Canadian as the regional manager up in Canada. Prior to that it had been run by somebody here at corporate who also had other things to do at the same time. We made a number of changes in our regions and we also dedicated resources to working solely on our fast stores and our low 20% performance stores. So, we have a group of people now who were experienced led by a woman who was one of our best district managers and a number of support staff who concentrate solely on that group of stores, for example. There was also an announcement that I think went out last night. Joe Jeffries was named vice president of store operations. I think you'll probably be able to see that on our website today. So we've had a number of ongoing changes here. Some people departed. We've put some new people in new jobs. Certainly, we've tried to refocus in an effort to have dedicated people on stores that were losing money, on Canada, on small stores. There's a group of people dedicated to those and a group of people dedicated to M2 remodels. Michael Baker - Deutsche Banc - Analyst So are there things that these people that can talk about have done specifically within the stores yet or is it just the change in leadership is, sort of, reinvigorating some of the trends? 17 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Rick Lepley - Office Depot Inc. - EVP-North American Retail Stores It's actually about--the change in leadership was important in some of those areas and certainly they've already been doing things that we can see results from. Michael Baker - Deutsche Banc - Analyst Okay. Thanks a lot. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot Inc. - Chairman and CEO Thanks for listening. I just summarize I think what the essence of what you're hearing us say is that our efforts to focus on those key drivers of results are producing tangible measurable, specific improvements. From our merchandising efforts in our retail stores, to the remerchandising efforts in technology, to the focus on the right mix of advertising expense and how we do it, to the focus on improving our costs at the same time improving our quality, to our focus of improving our North America real estate portfolio, the rollout of M2, the design of M2, to the improvement in the contract growth rates of our business, to margin improvement across virtually all of our channels; in most key categories, it's about focus on those things that make a difference and drive shareholder value over the long term. Any business has its up and down economic cycles. We talked in the press release about our cautious optimism. That is cautious optimism. There are lots of things we're continuing to do. And I know a lot of people wonder can we do them all. Reality is we've shown enormous ability to do them and execute them near flawlessly and our confidence in the future of our ability to drive revenue, profitability, growth and RONA remains stronger than ever. Thanks for the opportunity to ask us questions and listen to the call. If we've not been able to answer all of them, please feel free to call investor relations and we'll try to give you the answers you'd like to have. Have a great day and thanks again for listening.

Earnings Conference Call Neil Austrian - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman & CEO Thanks, Sean. Good morning, everyone. Joining me today on the call will be Charlie Brown, our Chief Financial Officer; Rick Lepley, our Executive Vice President of North American Retail; and Chuck Rubin, our executive Vice President and Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer. Before I turn the call over to Charlie, I would like to quickly recap our third quarter. Third quarter sales grew by 3% to $3.3 billion. We recorded GAAP earnings per share of 28 cents which is at the high end of our earlier revised guidance and a penny below last year's 29 cents per share. North American retail posted its third consecutive quarter of positive comps despite a very challenging back-to-school environment. North American retail profitability improved, primarily due to improved comparable product margins and operating cost controls. Profitability improved in our business services group thanks to continued store and warehouse expense reductions. Sales challenges limited the performance of our international group. As we stated back in September, we're working diligently to improve the performance of our contract sales force in Europe. Our global eCommerce sales increased by 15% to $771 million for the quarter and we remain on track to record over $3 billion in eCommerce sales for this year. And finally, we announced a $500 million share repurchase program. We think this clearly demonstrates our commitment to driving shareholder returns and affirms our belief in the future prospects of Office Depot. I'll have some additional comments and thoughts for you at the end of the call, particularly concerning my immediate priorities and goals. For now I'll let Charley, Rick and Chuck provide you with detailed insights on the quarter. Now, let me turn the call over to Charlie Brown, our Chief Financial Officer, to discuss the third quarter financial results. Charlie Brown - Office Depot, Inc. - EVP & CFO Thanks, Neil, and good morning, everyone. I would now like to share more insights into our third quarter and year-to-date performance. As you know, on September 14th we announced that we expected third quarter earnings per share to fall below the First Call consensus estimates. Our third quarter EPS was 28 cents, in line with our revised guidance of 26-28 cents. Total company sales for the first quarter grew by 3% to $3.3 billion compared to the third quarter of 2003. For the first nine months of 2004 sales grew 11%. Worldwide comparable sales in our 931 stores and 80 delivery centers were flat for the third quarter, but increased 1% for the first nine months of 2004. These results are in line with our lowered estimates reflecting sales softness across our business segments. Operating profit for the third quarter decreased by 5% to $135 million, but increased by 12% to $430 million for the first nine months compared to the same period in 2003. In the third quarter, operating cost controls in retail and continued supply chain efficiencies were offset by cost increases in international and G&A, along with increased store pre-opening expenses. Improvements in retail product category margins were offset by retail product mix shifts towards technology items and by margin pressure in BSG. Additionally, we experienced disruption in a number of our stores and distribution facilities from the series of hurricanes that hit the southeastern U.S. during the third quarter. On a year-to-date basis, our profit increase primarily reflects the addition of Guilbert to our international group in June of 2003. Positive comp sales and continued improvement in expense controls in both our North American and BSG segments and, of course, positive foreign currency impacts. General and administrative expenses increased compared to the third quarter of last year. Contributing to the increase were employee-related costs and professional fees which were largely related to our Sarbanes-Oxley compliance effort, expensing certain systems development costs, and the negative impact of translating international expenses at weaker U.S. dollar exchange rates. We expect G&A spending in dollars to be in line with 2003 for the fourth quarter. Third quarter GAAP earnings was 28 cents were diluted share compared with 29 cents for the same period last year. For the first nine months of 2004, GAAP net earnings were diluted share was 90 cents compared to 82 cents for the same period in 2003. Our first quarter 2003 results reflect the adoption of EITF 0216 which reduced diluted earnings per share by 8 cents for the first quarter, while the second quarter of 2003 included a positive 3 cent foreign currency effect on funds held in anticipation of our Guilbert acquisition. Results for the first quarter of 2004 included a one cent per share cost related to the settlement of an outstanding legal claim, while the second quarter included a 2 cent per share gain related to the settlement of certain claims associated with our European distribution system. We recorded a 30% effective tax rate for the third quarter. We expect that rate to remain relatively stable for the balance of 2004. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow metrics for the total company. Year-to-date free cash flow was $325 million with $247 million in capital expenditures. Inventory levels declined by $60 million from last year to $1.13 billion reflecting continued improvements in our supply chain. North American contract DSO were 43 days. That was flat with a third quarter of last year and an increase of one day over the second quarter of this year. 3 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call As a result, our cash and short term investments exceeded $1.2 billion at the end of the third quarter, an increase of about 200 million from the second quarter and 400 million from the prior year. Now, I'll move to our individual business segments. First our North American retail business. Total sales increased 3% to $1.5 billion in the quarter. Comparable sales increased 1% for the quarter. Although below our expectations, we are pleased to report three consecutive quarters of positive comp sales, a trend we expect to continue into the fourth quarter. Despite our lowered expectations, we still expect fourth quarter comps to be the best of the year. The increase in comparable sales were attributable to strong sales of technology products, somewhat offset by softness in supplies and furniture. Comparable technology sales increased in the double-digit range for both the quarter and year-to-date. Our aggregate furniture and other category reported a comp sales decline of 3% for the quarter and 1% year-to-date. Core office supplies declined 3% for the quarter and 1% year-to-date largely due to disappointing back-to-school sales and strong sales in 2003 from the launch of Ink Depot. Excluding computers, back-to-school sales declined 6% versus 2003. Average transaction size increased for the third quarter and first nine months because of the mix shift towards technology products, while comparable transactions declined in both periods. During the quarter the company opened 24 new retail stores, closed two stores and relocated 6 stores. At the end of the third quarter we operated a total of 923 office products superstores throughout North America. Margins increased in both supplies and furniture for the third quarter but were mostly offset by a higher mix of lower margin technology sales. The attachment rate of supplies with technology sales were below expectations putting some pressure on overall margins. A strong focus on managing operating costs as well as targeted efforts at improving underperforming stores continues to improve profitability as operating expenses trended at favorable levels in the third quarter, declining by 30 basis points compared to last year. Payroll savings contributed over 80 basis points largely because of a more flexible staffing and lower wage rates associated with an increasing mix towards part-time staff. Advertising, principally driven by the summer Olympics, was higher than in 2003 and largely offset the payroll savings. Overall segment operating profit increased 7% in the third quarter and 10% year-to-date compared to the prior year. Additionally, our decision to delay new store openings to allow us to incorporate our new M2 format resulted in higher-than-expected pre-opening costs in the third quarter. We expect to also incur higher pre-opening costs in the fourth quarter. For our North American business services group, total sales increased by 2% in the quarter and for the first nine months of 2004 compared to the prior year. Contract sales increased 2% for the quarter and 3% year-to-date. While results so far this year have been below our expectations, we remain confident in our sales force re-alignment and continue hiring additional resources in this area. We are also making investment in resources targeted to smaller contract and commercial customers. Commercial sales increased 3% for the quarter versus the prior year, slightly better than second quarter trends. Increases in Office Depot catalog sales were largely offset by declines in Viking sales. Domestic eCommerce sales, which are included in our various business segments, grew 12% during the quarter and for the first nine months of 2004. We expect our worldwide eCommerce sales this year to exceed $3 billion. This is an important component of taking costs out of our business while adding value for our customers. BSG's gross margins declined about 80 basis points in the second quarter. Competitive pricing pressures, increases in the cost of paper and promotional activity in our catalog business contributed to the decline in margin. Our North American warehouse costs continued to improve in the third quarter compared to the prior year, dropping by 35 basis points. Warehouse costs have now declined for 15 consecutive quarters, evidence of a continuing focus on execution and driving out costs. Use of third-party delivery and labor efficiencies are again the primary contributors. Combined these results generated a 5% increase in segment operating profit for the quarter and 3% year-to-date compared to the prior year. International group sales grew 4% in U.S. dollars but declined 5% in local currency during the third quarter compared to the prior year. The United Kingdom, Germany, France and the Netherlands all posted local currency declines. Positive local currency catalog sales growth in the U.K. was more than offset by catalog declines in the other major countries. Contract sales in local currencies declined in the double-digit range, with declines in all the major European countries. While we have successfully achieved the purchasing synergies expected on the Guilbert acquisition, performance of the sales force continues to be challenging and is our top priority in Europe at this time. Retail comps in Europe were up 8% for the quarter in local currencies with a very strong performance in France, the result of a sustained focus on improving product assortment and service levels. We opened two retail stores in France and three in Japan during the quarter, bringing our wholly-owned international store count to 76. International gross profit as a percentage of sales increased by about 70 basis points in the third quarter. Continued purchasing leverage largely due to the Guilbert acquisition was partially offset by increasing competitive pressures. Total store and warehouse operating and selling expenses increased as a percent of sales in the third quarter, principally because of deleveraging on lower sales in local currencies; but actually declined as 4 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call measured in local currencies. International segment operating profit benefited from foreign exchange rates by $9 million for the quarter and $29 million for the first nine months of 2004 compared to last year. In summary, our sales growth was disappointing this quarter. However, we remain confident that we are investing in the right strategies to drive future growth including expanding our retail and delivery presence in the northeast, remodeling the older stores to the M2 format, expanding our contract sales force in both North America and Europe, bargaining resources into small contract customers and implementing merchandising systems to improve execution at the store level. At the same time we're investing for growth, we intend to aggressively take costs out of the business. We have implemented a more flexible retail staffing model. Supply chain execution and cost reduction efforts continue to deliver savings while maintaining service levels. We've successfully taken the costs out of some of our support functions, but we're looking to aggressively accelerate those efforts. At this time we remain comfortable with our full year EPS guidance of $1.08 to $1.14. This is driven by low to mid single-digit comps in North American retail, low to mid single-digit comps in BSG. And finally, negative to flat local currency sales in international. Furthermore, we expect no significant increase in inventory levels despite 80 new store openings. CapEx in the 375 to $400 million range and free cash flow generation of 275 to 325 million. At this point I'd like to turn it over to Rick Lepley who will provide greater insight into the trends and initiatives in our retail division. Rick Lepley - Office Depot, Inc. - EVP, North American Retail Thanks, Charlie and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by giving you an update on our real estate activities. We made progress during the third quarter on our Kids 'R Us transaction. To remind everyone, back in March we announced our agreement with Toys 'R Us to acquire 124 of their former Kids 'R Us locations for $197 million in cash plus the assumption of lease obligations. Shortly thereafter we also announced our agreement with Petco to sell 20 sites for approximately $45 million plus the assumption of certain lease obligations. By the end of the third quarter we had closed on 82 of the properties, 19 stores have been removed from the transaction by mutual agreement with Toys 'R Us, bringing the deal site count down to 105; and we expect to close on the remaining stores by the end of the fourth quarter. We plan on converting approximately 50 of these sites into Office Depot stores. As of today, we have closed on 43 of those 50 KRU sites, 7 are currently open for business and 10 will open in the next two weeks. And by the end of the fourth quarter, I expect that 35 to 40 of these stores will be operational. Of course, we are actively marketing the excess sites. In the third quarter we remodeled 3 stores and we plan on remodeling about 15 stores in Q4, and more on that in just a minute. During the third quarter we also opened 24 new stores, we closed 2 stores, and we relocated 6 stores to bring our North American retail total to 923. And in the fourth quarter we expect to open approximately 50 new stores. Now, let me update you on the M2 store program. At the end of the third quarter 33 M2s were open for business. That is a combination of 24 new stores, 6 relocations, and 3 remodels. Our very small remodel sample size of only 3 stores is simply too small to allow us to draw specific conclusions on the program's investment performance. And to remind everyone we limited our remodel program in Q3 to avoid sales disruptions during the back-to-school period. If the fourth quarter we expect to remodel an additional 15 stores and will continue to closely evaluate the performance of the M2 remodels. Decisions regarding a broader remodel rollout will likely be made by the second quarter of 2005. New stores with the target M2 footprint, that's the footprint greater than 15,000 square feet, are currently tracking above our internal pro forma sales projections. On a productivity basis the new stores have higher average sales per square foot versus a comparative new store group in the prior year. Now we don't have deep financial history on any of these new stores yet, but we will provide you with periodic updates as we continue to open new stores going forward. Finally, here are some other highlights on the quarter. Our focus on profitability continues to deliver results. In the third quarter our store and warehouse expenses were down about 30 basis points as compared to last year. And this was primarily due to better management of our payroll expenses. We have established greater pay rate consistency for given positions across the chain. Also, we continued to manage our work force mix towards a better balance of full-time versus part-time employees, all without sacrificing customer service. Our underperforming stores task force continues to deliver results as well. Year-to-date we have elevated this overall group of stores to a cash flow positive status. We will continue to invest management time to drive further improvement in this store group. I'm very pleased to announce two enhancements to the stores leadership team. First, George Hill was recently promoted from Regional Vice President to Senior Vice President-Regional Operations. In this role he will manage 6 regional vice presidents, drive consistent execution across the six regions and improve our focus on training and developing personnel. Prior to joining our team, George was a regional vice president for Home Depot. Second, I'm happy to note the hiring of Bob Osborne as our Vice President of Real Estate. Bob joins us most recently from Mitsubishi 5 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Motor Sales of America and during his 14 years at Mitsubishi one of the responsibilities included the oversite of real estate site election in the eastern portion of the United States. Bob will be responsible for our real estate strategy and I'm confident that he will help us to further develop our quantitative and qualitative site selection capabilities as we continue our store expansion program into next year. With that I'd like to turn the call over to Chuck Rubin, our Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer. Chuck Rubin - Office Depot, Inc. - EVP & Chief Merchandising/Marketing Officer Thanks, Rick. Good morning, everyone. Let me address retail stores performance first and add some depth to what Rick mentioned. Despite a disappointing performance to our sales plan, we did achieve our third consecutive positive comp sales quarter, as you've heard, after 15 negative quarters. We believe this is evidence that some of our merchandising initiatives intended to turn around our performance have begun to take hold. Overall, compared to last year we posted a 1% sales comp with a slightly higher gross margin rate and slightly higher gross margin dollars. In addition, inventory turn improved as well. The technology group led the comp sales group. For the quarter, technology sales were up double-digits. Computer sales drove this performance. Notebooks, desktops and our best-in-class build-to-order all performed well. Notebooks, which deliver higher margin, had comp sales growth of over 225% and outpaced desktop growth. This is in line with our focus on mobility for our core business customer segment. Also posting positive comp sales were technology services, wireless accessories, drives, memory and networking. Initiatives to boost the sales of higher margin technology products as well as to improve the attachment rates of supply items continued. Our technology remerchandising initiative was completed in the scheduled 635 retail locations. Attach rates showed some improvement versus last year and we remain optimistic about positive future growth. Sales and center programs were tested and will continue where appropriate. We also piloted a first of its kind technology recycling program. The campaign ran as scheduled through the back-to-school period and was received with strong customer acceptance. We are currently reviewing options to reactivate the program. Turning to our other product categories, our furniture group comp sales were negative due to significant clearance activity last year; however, overall gross margin dollars and rate were significantly higher year-over-year. The Christopher Lowell furniture collections continue to perform well. We will be introducing a new collection and new business oriented pieces in November and due to our tight inventory controls and vendor partnerships the transition will occur with virtually no end of life inventory liability. Supplies experienced disappointing comp sales but achieved higher gross margin dollars and rate compared to last year. Our overall back-to-school selling results were disappointing despite improving during the last few weeks of the season. Despite those lower sales, we did achieve higher gross margin rates in dollars for back-to-school product as well, compared to the year-ago period. Even with the lower-than-planned sales, our end of life inventory was well controlled and we achieved an out of stock date significantly earlier than last year's back-to-school time frame. Ink and toner experienced slightly negative comp sales as well as we continued to comp a strong launch of Ink Depot. Let me turn to BSG segment's performance. BSG sales increased 2% for the quarter, with sales improving across most major product divisions. Contract sales increased 2% while commercial sales, including 4SURE, increased 3%. Growth in the OD brand in 4SURE was partially offset by a decline of the Viking brand. Furniture and supplies both delivered good comp increases. In fact, all supply departments were up in the contract group and many were positive in our commercial business. Categories that were particularly strong include ink and toner along with writing instruments. BSG gross margin dollars declined slightly in the third quarter compared to last year due to us absorbing higher paper costs along with a continued competitive promotional environment in both our catalog and Office Depot eCommerce channels. Let me give you a brief update on a couple of our key merchandising initiatives. First, private brand penetration as a percentage of sales increased for the year-to-date period to 13.5% of our total sales and, in fact, penetration reached 15.5% during the last month of the quarter. We continue to expand our successful Christopher Lowell collection in both furniture and accessories. Our writing instrument brand, Foray, which was launched during the third quarter, continues to meet sales expectations at a gross margin rate of 70 points and above. Private brand penetration will continue to accelerate through the balance of this year and into 2005. On the global purchasing front we continue to work closely with our international counterparts. Through a combination of conventional bids and eAuctions, we continued to lower costs on all product categories addressed thus far. Through Q3, 14 product categories have been reviewed with an additional 7 categories to be reviewed in Q4, and this program will continue into next year. 6 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call In the area of pricing we continued our North American retail category pricing review. This review is intended to ensure that we remain competitive in the marketplace while optimizing our margin expansion opportunities. This initiative contributed, along with other margin enhancement efforts, to our Q3 financial performance by delivering higher margin rates in many of our product categories. We will continue this program as well into Q4 and into 2005 as a core component of our profit improvement initiative. We also implemented during Q3 new operational processes and strengthened our organizational structure. Examples include the establishment of a new merchandise planning group and the implementation of a new standardized assortment planning process. These, along with other improvements, will help us achieve and sustain improved execution of the key initiatives. Moving on to our Magellan project, over halfway into the project we remain on track and on budget. Modules now in place across the chain include forecasting and planning, pricing, assortment planning and improved merchandise reporting. During the quarter we also began the 2005 planning process with the new preseason planning module. Let me quickly recap a couple of our advertising initiatives. We continued our aggressive approach of rationalizing our overall marketing spend by focusing our spend on those vehicles driving incremental sales and incremental margin dollars. As you hear, the third quarter spending level was up slightly versus last year, as planned, due to our support of the summer Olympics in Athens. Despite this we continue to expect our overall 2004 spending rate to be lower than 2003 levels while still achieving our financial performance goals. During the quarter we realigned our marketing group to improve collaboration with merchandising and other functional areas. The new structure will provide a more integrated team focus and ability to understand and act quickly upon customer insights. We continue to refine our insert strategy in terms of content, creative and distribution. We are pleased with the initial results of this more analytically derived approach. Another key enabler to improving our marketing investment spend is the advantage loyalty program. This program now has over 1.9 million members, which is slightly ahead of our plan, through the end of the third quarter. Our analysis of these customers confirms that they visit Office Depot channels more frequently, spend more per visit and are more loyal to our brand than our other customers. During this past quarter, we began to directly market to them. Our drive to expand our membership base and effort to individually market to them will continue for the balance of the year and into next. As we look forward we believe we will achieve our Q4 sales comps through the following: an improved organizational structure, new processes in merchandising and marketing enabled by the Magellan project, a continued customer-centric focus, a continued analytical decision-making approach, and finally a heightened focus on execution and accountability throughout merchandising and marketing. With that I'll turn the call back to Neil. Neil Austrian - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman & CEO Thank you, Chuck. Before we move into the question-and-answer portion of the call, I'd like to share just a few thoughts. As I mentioned earlier I have, really, two or three main goals during my tenure as CEO. The first is to instill greater alignment and accountability to drive both the speed and quality of execution of our key strategic initiatives. As I said when I accepted this job, I didn't come into it as a caretaker and intend to perform as a very active Chief Executive Officer. And, secondly, really assist in the identification selection and hiring of a permanent Chief Executive Officer for the Company. At a more operational level, I'm focused on three keep priorities: Improving our North American retail profitability while aggressively rolling out new stores in the northeast, increasing our market share within the Company's North American Business Services Group and fulfilling the promise of profitable contract sales growth in Europe. These priorities will be carried out with a sharp focus on proper fiscal management and capital discipline. For example, just yesterday we announced our decision to place on hold, indefinitely, the development of a new global corporate head quarters in south Florida. We have pressing issues to address in all of our business units and limiting our managerial and financial focus to areas that directly influence these results will best serve our shareholders at this time. In addition, we're currently conducting a thorough review of our overall cost structure to enhance our financial performance while remaining competitive in the marketplace. I plan to share with you the outcome of this review over the next several months. We will be hosting our investor meeting next month in Washington, D.C. At the meeting I hope to expose everyone to a deeper portion of our management team, to set high-level expectations for fiscal 2005 and communicate our key plans and actions to drive the business going forward. After being on the job for just over two weeks, I can say that I really am pleased with our current plans and our employees commitment to execute against these plans. I look forward to meeting many of you in Washington in November and now, operator, I'd like to turn the call over to you for questions. 7 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Operator [Caller Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Matt Fassler - Goldman Sachs - Analyst Thanks so much and good morning. I'd like to ask a couple questions. The first one would be just to get a bit more of an explanation of what's happening in Europe. Clearly, from a sales perspective you don't have the traction on the contract side that you expected. That's something that we haven't heard a whole lot about in detail in terms of the progress of the Guilbert integration and what might be going wrong there. So if you could shed a little bit of light on that I'd appreciate it. Then I have a brief follow-up. Neil Austrian - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman & CEO Yeah, let me try, Matt. I think when we acquired Guilbert there were two keys to that acquisition. The first was to really see if we could drive purchasing and operational efficiencies throughout the two organizations, which we did achieve; and, frankly, we're on target for that. When we acquired Guilbert we knew that the corporate cultures of the two companies were vastly different. We had a very aggressive sales force very committed to prospecting, acquiring new business. I can't say that they milked the business but they were basically in a status of basically caretakers and basically sitting on their accounts and not being as aggressive as we would have liked. And I think we probably underestimated what it would take to integrate the sales forces and change that kind of culture. Charlie and I plan to spend a good several days in Europe in the next two weeks and meet with Rolf and his management team to go over how they plan to make these changes which are underway at this point in time. Matt Fassler - Goldman Sachs - Analyst And Neil, have you lost sales people, has there been turnover to the extent that you're seeing local currency declines at this point? Neil Austrian - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman & CEO I think there has been turnover. Mostly, from our standpoint, on a positive basis in terms of the people that really couldn't compete with our people and we're in the process of hiring and replacing those. We haven't lost as many people as you might expect just due to the merger that we wanted to keep. Matt Fassler - Goldman Sachs - Analyst Gotcha. My second question is directed towards Rick at least vis-a-vis the retail business. Just to play devils advocate for a moment on your move to more part-time sales people. Obviously this is an issue I'd imagine that the Company had thought about from time to time and contemplated industry best practices. You know, sometimes when that happens you tend to see dilution over time in customer service. I know you discussed the notion that customer service won't be sacrificed. But if you can discuss how you're compensating for the reality of having some less seasoned people, I guess, and people who are going to be more part timers in the store. And also if you could try to quantify the change in the mix for us. 8 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Rick Lepley - Office Depot, Inc. - EVP, North American Retail Yeah, Matt the primary way that we're trying to do this is when we're opening new stores we're trying to move full time employees from surrounding stores into the new store to change the mix in both stores. Obviously we are focused on customer care and the quality of service that we're delivering. We are trying to do it in such a way that that's not affected. We've also done quite a bit of it through attrition. Matt Fassler - Goldman Sachs - Analyst And can you talk about the magnitude of the full-time versus part-time numbers chainwide? Rick Lepley - Office Depot, Inc. - EVP, North American Retail Yeah, a lot depends too on the mix of hours. Our full-time employees are working about 40 hours a week and our part-time employees are working considerably less. I don't really have a number on that right now but that's a big part of how we're achieving the mix as well. Matt Fassler - Goldman Sachs - Analyst Okay, thank you. Operator Thank you, next question. Aram Rubinson with Banc of America, your line is open. Aram Rubinson - Banc of America - Analyst Thanks, yeah. Two lines of questioning, I guess. The first, I really want to understand the mix of PCs at your retail stores this quarter versus last for starters. Neil Austrian - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman & CEO Chuck, do you want to answer that? Chuck Rubin - Office Depot, Inc. - EVP & Chief Merchandising/Marketing Officer Yeah, in terms of notebooks to desktops you're saying? Aram Rubinson - Banc of America - Analyst I don't know, just computers as a percent of the mix as hardware preferably if you can give us. Chuck Rubin - Office Depot, Inc. - EVP & Chief Merchandising/Marketing Officer The -- well, we still sell more desktops than we sell notebooks. Notebooks is growing at a much faster clip than desktops. In terms of our mix of the hardware versus the others I'm not sure that we break that out so-- 9 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Aram Rubinson - Banc of America - Analyst Can you ballpark it? Like it's not ten, right? I mean -- Neil Austrian - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman & CEO I think from a competitive standpoint I'd really prefer not to break that out at this point in time. Aram Rubinson - Banc of America - Analyst Alright, so let me ask the question a different way. You said that your technology comps were up double-digits. How much did that add to the total comp? Rick Lepley - Office Depot, Inc. - EVP, North American Retail How much did that add to the total comp? Our technology area comped positive in the double-digits. Our overall comp was a--at retail level now I'm speaking--our overall comp was 1%. So to the -- at the highest level technology accounted for our comp increase. Supplies and furniture are the other two major groups that we -- within our product hierarchy actually experienced negative comps. So technology was the driver. Aram Rubinson - Banc of America - Analyst Okay, I'm just curious if those other categories were, you know, down three, down five, down whatever. Charlie Brown - Office Depot, Inc. - EVP & CFO This is Charlie. I think we talked about supplies were actually down three. Aram Rubinson - Banc of America - Analyst Okay. And then tell me the second line of questioning is when you do have kind of a future plan for-- with the new CEO in place and such, is it going to be the type of thing in your mind that you need to infuse new investments to jump start the Company? Or is it the kind of plan where you hope to reap investments that you have already made? Neil Austrian - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman & CEO I think it is the latter. I mean, I think as I said when I accepted the job and where I feel very comfortable today. It's really a question of execution. I don't see any change in strategy at this point. I don't see that we have to make any additional investment other than what we've already talked about, which is really the new store openings on retail side and the hiring and adding to our sales staff domestically here at BSG. Aram Rubinson - Banc of America - Analyst Okay. Well, we'll look forward to seeing you in D.C. Thank you. Operator Thank you, the next question, Dan Binder with Buckingham Research. Your line is open. 10 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Dan Binder - Buckingham Research - Analyst Hi, a couple questions. First, based on the remodel activity that you've given us this quarter and next quarter, it looks like maybe the remodels for the year are down a bit and you're talking about, sort of, reviewing that in the second quarter of next year in terms of ongoing plans. I'm just curious what's going on in that front and if I'm correct on the remodels for the year coming down, what has prompted that is my first question? Neil Austrian - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman & CEO I think -- you are accurate. I think what we want to do is have enough of a test sample group of remodels to ensure ourselves that the investment that we're making in remodels is going to pay off. I think we're very happy with the M2 stores themselves. As Rick said, they're tracking above our internal pro formas, but I guess we're at a point where we'd like to test a few things and make sure we're on track and see if the remodeling expense is justified. And we'll have a better sense of that by the second quarter of next year. Dan Binder - Buckingham Research - Analyst Does that take assessment take into consideration that if those that are not remodeled that they may actually lose share versus just looking at it an absolute sales lift. Rick Lepley - Office Depot, Inc. - EVP, North American Retail No, there's no indication at this point that we would lose share as a result of remodels. I've characterized it further by saying that we're looking at three different levels of remodel. One that, as you know, and we've already told you costs about 250 to 275 and then two other remodels slightly less than the first and then another one that is quite a bit less than the first that would give it the look without changing a whole lot of fixed assets. So we'll be testing that. We're also testing three different labor models. In the three remodels that we've done, we have actually three tests going on; obviously one in each store, for three different labor models right now. So we'll learn a lot more about these. If we get a total of 18 or 20, let's say they're open for 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 months then we'll have a much better sense of which way we want to go with this to optimize return on investment. Dan Binder - Buckingham Research - Analyst Okay, then second question was on your announcement yesterday with regards to putting on hold plans for the global headquarters. I guess how far down the path should we expect any kind of charges to unwind, any contracts that may have been in place? And then the last question is with regard to your retail comp outlook I guess I suspect that me, and maybe others on the call, are a bit surprised that you're still looking for your highest comp of the year out of Q4. Can you give us some color on what you've seen so far to give you that confidence? Neil Austrian - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman & CEO Sure, let me try. To answer your first question it's our guess that we will probably have a fourth quarter charge, which was not reflected in Charlie's comments, of between 4 and $6 million; which reflects permitting, some legal costs and things we've done. At the same time I would have to say that land values down here have increased in value and we have not taken that into account which we'll only do at such time as we either sell or dispose of the property. As relates to your comps and--your question on comps in the fourth quarter, all I can say is that what we're seeing right now for the first three-plus weeks in October. One is very exciting for us. But two, more importantly, if that holds, which we fully expect it will at this point, it will be our highest level of comps for the year. 11 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Dan Binder - Buckingham Research - Analyst Okay. Thank you. Operator Thank you. The next question, Colin McGranahan with Stanford Bernstein. Your line is open. Colin McGranahan - Sanford Bernstein - Analyst Yes, thank you. First just like to follow up on Europe. Can you comment a little bit on maybe who you're losing share to in the contract space there? And any additional commentary you can give us on, you know, what your initial thoughts are on how to integrate that sales force a little better and how you can change that culture? Neil Austrian - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman & CEO Specifically I don't know. I think it's probably across-the-board. And in terms of what we intend to do, as I mentioned earlier, we're going to spend some time in Europe in the next week or two. And I really think it gets back to what I thought I had said earlier is that when you put two different cultures together, which this was, I think we underestimated how difficult the transformation was going to be from taking a sales force that basically were just farmers and were just harvesting what they had to turning them into hunters. That's the best I can answer it at this point. Colin McGranahan - Sanford Bernstein - Analyst Okay. Thanks. Second question on the contract business. It sounded yesterday when Boise reported that they're looking for lower margins in their contract business. I know in your release you commented on the competitive environment in the overall BSG business. Can you just comment on what you're seeing in terms of acquiring new contracts, maintaining and keeping existing contracts in terms of the competitive environment currently. Neil Austrian - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman & CEO Let me have Cindy Campbell, who runs our BSG business, comment. Cindy Campbell - Office Depot, Inc. - EVP, Delivery Sales I think it depends upon which segment we're looking at and the mix of business that a contract customer or contract stationer would have. It's highly competitive at the very highest end. There is margin opportunity in the mid to small markets. Charlie Brown - Office Depot, Inc. - EVP & CFO One of the others problems we've had Colin currently is, again, some of our pressures have come around paper costs and in the contract business it's more difficult to pass those along as quickly as you can in retail. Colin McGranahan - Sanford Bernstein - Analyst All right. Okay. Final question, Neil, can you just comment on any progress you're making with the CEO search and then any comments on the share repurchase strategy as well? 12 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Neil Austrian - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman & CEO I met with Heidrick & Struggles last Friday in New York and team that they have put on this assignment. They are coming down here to Del Ray tonight, will meet with the full board tomorrow, and that's as best as I can do at this point. We don't have any specific names, we haven't interviewed anybody and that will happen over the next several months. As to the repurchase strategy we have a meeting tonight, I believe it is, or early tomorrow morning with our finance committee where we will lay out our recommendations for implementing the $500 million share repurchase. And at such point as we have any details we'll certainly make an announcement. Colin McGranahan - Sanford Bernstein - Analyst Good. Look forward to that, thank you. Operator Thank you. Next question, Danielle Fox with Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Danielle Fox - Merrill Lynch - Analyst Thank you, good morning. Neil, could you give us little bit more detail on what your objectives are with the extensive review of ODP's overall cost structure. The historical trend seems to suggest that Office Depot has been able to protect, and in some cases, expand margins even in a negative comps environment for the stores. So I'm wondering where you see the largest inefficiencies. Neil Austrian - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman & CEO I don't know where the largest are at this point after nine days. What I can say is that any organization as large as ours with $13.5 billion in sales can always benefit from business reviews and a relook at how we do business. We've got a very large G&A account, and as I go if with our key management and have these kind of detailed reviews, I fully expect that we'll find both some cost savings and some ways to execute better so that we can get margin improvement. Danielle Fox - Merrill Lynch - Analyst Okay. I guess and the second question would just be, you mentioned in the closing comments that your goals, besides accountability and capital discipline, were improving North American retail profitability with an aggressive rollout of new stores. I guess I'm wondering why continue to roll out new stores so aggressively? I can understand relocations but, you know, what is the rationale for aggressively rolling out new stores? Neil Austrian - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman & CEO Well, I think there's two pieces to the rush. The first is that we were very nonaggressive over the past several years in terms of opening new stores. And we think we see a unique opportunity in the northeast that we've left to Staples, basically by themselves, and we think the customers deserve a choice. And we, frankly, think that we have that kind of opportunity which was evidenced when we acquired the Kids 'R Us stores and we intend to exploit that. Danielle Fox - Merrill Lynch - Analyst Thank you. 13 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Operator Thank you. The next question, Bill Sims, your line is open with Smith Barney. Bill Sims - Smith Barney - Analyst Good morning. Thank you I have two related questions. In the contracting commercial business can you comment of whether it was average ticket or number of transactions that drove sales? And related to that any comment on the business spending environment? Have we seen a pick up or is it still anemic? Thank you. Neil Austrian - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman & CEO I'm sorry. Could you repeat that? We couldn't understand it at this end. I'm sorry. Bill Sims - Smith Barney - Analyst In the contracting commercial business, I was wondering if you could point to was it average ticket or number of transactions that were driving the sales growth in those two segments? And comment on the overall macro environment in terms of business spending, have you seen a pickup or does it remain anemic? Cindy Campbell - Office Depot, Inc. - EVP, Delivery Sales This is Cindy Campbell. The average transactions have actually increased. That would be the cause for the growth. Bill Sims - Smith Barney - Analyst Okay, and has average ticket turned positive, or does that still remain negative? Cindy Campbell - Office Depot, Inc. - EVP, Delivery Sales It's positive, absolutely. Bill Sims - Smith Barney - Analyst Thank you. Can you just make a macro comment on the environment that you're operating in? Neil Austrian - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman & CEO I still can't understand you. I apologize. We're having a problem at our end understanding what you're saying. Cindy Campbell - Office Depot, Inc. - EVP, Delivery Sales It's cutting out a bit. I think the business environment--if I heard you, I think you're questioning-- is the business environment positive or negative. Is that, correct? 14 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Bill Sims - Smith Barney - Analyst That's correct. Cindy Campbell - Office Depot, Inc. - EVP, Delivery Sales I think it's neutral at this point. We haven't seen a substantial shift in any -- in either direction. It's been that way sort of throughout the year at this point. Bill Sims - Smith Barney - Analyst All right, thank you. Operator Thank you. Next question, Mark Rowen with Prudential. Your line is open. Mark Rowen - Prudential - Analyst Thanks. Good morning. A couple of questions. First you mentioned that the attach rates on your technology sales weren't up to your expectations. I wonder if you could just give us a little bit more detail on that? Do you think that you just didn't execute well or do you think that the kind of technology products you were selling just didn't lend themselves as well as you thought to attaching, either warranties or accessories? And then I have a follow-up after that. Thanks. Neil Austrian - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman & CEO Chuck? Chuck Rubin - Office Depot, Inc. - EVP & Chief Merchandising/Marketing Officer I think it's a little bit of both. I think that as we continue to refine our assortments and get them focused that attachment items, and this isn't just to technology although that's a core driver. The types of attachment items that we carry and how we merchandise them will improve. On the execution side, we can merchandise them much better. Merchandise them both in terms of how we advertise them and position them in our ads, merchandise them in stores, and also how our sales people in the store work with customers. So, as I mentioned in my comments, we've seen improvement but it is a key opportunity that we think is ahead of us for much better results. Mark Rowen - Prudential - Analyst Okay. And then, Neil, I just kind of have a broad question for you. It seems like you've got a lot of things to fix in the business. The European business isn't doing well, North American contract seems to be under tremendous competitive pressure, you're opening a lot of new stores for the first time in a number of years, you're remodeling a bunch of stores. Do you think you've got too much going on and how do you focus the organization on all of those things? Do you think you might need to put off-- sort of following up on Danielle's question-- do you think you might need to put off some of those things and focus on one at a time and fix them, or do you need to fix them all at once to make this work? 15 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Neil Austrian - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman & CEO Actually, if you had seen the list of priorities that was on my desk when I got here we probably cut 150 of them out. I think we're very clearly focused on three, I don't think this is a bandwidth problem at all at this point. I think the organization-- and you'll talk to these folks in November. They understand very clearly there are three key priorities and I don't think that's a lot for a company this size. I think that we've got the management talent to do it. I think we've got the management depth to do it. And clearly as you talk to our people, you'll see that they clearly understand what we have to do and what everything is going to be focused on this coming year. Mark Rowen - Prudential - Analyst Okay. Great, thanks. Operator Thank you. Next question, Michael Baker with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Michael Baker - Deutsche Banc - Analyst Hi. Thanks. I was kind of breaking up earlier so hopefully this question wasn't already asked. If so, I apologize. But just to comment on the pricing environment, particularly in contract, reading between the lines on some of your comments. It sounds like getting a little bit more aggressive across the board is that being initiated by you guys or competitors or what's the situation there? Cindy Campbell - Office Depot, Inc. - EVP, Delivery Sales I think that it's a historical situation. One that we, frankly, chose not to respond to for a period of time. It is highly competitive. Our competitors are worthy competitors. And they are looking at their pricing mechanisms by taking advantage of all the assets they have, including marketing and that sort of thing. Typically we haven't gone that route. And we sustained a fairly clean approach to pricing, one which is still the path that we're on. Michael Baker - Deutsche Banc - Analyst So when you say you initially chose not to respond, so are you now responding or are you still maintaining your pricing? Cindy Campbell - Office Depot, Inc. - EVP, Delivery Sales I think we're responding in a different way than our other competitors perform. We have are having to respond, of course, to win business but we're choosing not to show the elements of our pricing perhaps the same way some of our competitors are. Michael Baker - Deutsche Banc - Analyst Okay. And retail-- pricing at retail, is there anything going on there or is that more benign? 16 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Chuck Rubin - Office Depot, Inc. - EVP & Chief Merchandising/Marketing Officer It continues to be a competitive environment out there. As I mentioned in my comments, we have done a good amount of work between the merchandising marketing group and store operations group. That work continues to ensure that we remain competitive on very identifiable products but we optimize our margin opportunities on other products that aren't quite as visible. Michael Baker - Deutsche Banc - Analyst Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Next question Gary Balter of UBS, your line is open. Gary Balter - UBS - Analyst Two questions. One is the corporate expenses keep on rising. Looks like it is now 4.9% on the. [ INAUDIBLE ] Why is that going up so high? Is that just you haven't allocated expenses? And if you haven't, where did that go? And if you have then why is corporate so high? Neil Austrian - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman & CEO I'm sorry, we could not hear anything that was said on that call. You're breaking up totally. Gary Balter - UBS - Analyst Can you hear me now? Neil Austrian - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman & CEO No. Cindy Campbell - Office Depot, Inc. - EVP, Delivery Sales Operator? Operator We're trying to adjust the line. One moment, please. Neil Austrian - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman & CEO Thank you. 17 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Operator Go ahead, please. Gary Balter - UBS - Analyst Hello? Operator Yes, go ahead, sir. Gary Balter - UBS - Analyst Could you hear me now? Neil Austrian - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman & CEO A little bit better. Gary Balter - UBS - Analyst Okay. Well, we'll try. Question was on margins. Your operating margin, I believe, is about 4.05 this quarter. If you add back the corporate, the corporate's about 4.9. Why is that such a high number and what's -- why is it growing so much and why is that not allocated to different divisions and what would that imply for the divisional profits if it was properly allocated. Neil Austrian - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman & CEO I'm sorry I cannot hear that, I apologize we have to see if we can answer that later or offline because I can't hear the question. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. David Katz with Matrix your line is open. David Katz - Matrix - Analyst Hi. I'm just trying to get a little color on the M2 store remodels. It seemed like prior to today's call you were very upbeat about the cost-effectiveness of it and is today taking a step back more related to a new CEO and just a fresh outlook or the fact that the store sales are not coming through as you had anticipated? Neil Austrian - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman & CEO No, we're still optimistic. I'll let Rick talk. I just feel, as does the management group, what we'd like to do before we spend a significant amount of capital to test to see whether or not we get the kind of lift that justifies this kind of investment. We're very happy with M2 at this point. Rick do you want to add anything? 18 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Earnings Conference Call Rick Lepley - Office Depot, Inc. - EVP, North American Retail The only thing I would add is that the same people who are in charge of the remodels are the same people who are in charge of opening the new stores. And our original plan called for closing on the KRU stores much earlier than it's turned out that we could close on those stores. And the result is, as you could see from the numbers I reviewed with you, 50 new store openings are now in the fourth quarter. So I think it's prudent to do these the right way, to study three different levels, to look at the three different labor models that we'e putting into these stores and if some of these remodels take place in the first quarter that's just fine with me. David Katz - Matrix - Analyst Thank you. Operator Okay. Again, Gary Balter, your line is open. Gary Balter - UBS - Analyst Can you hear me now? Neil Austrian - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman & CEO Yes. Gary Balter - UBS - Analyst Okay. Great. Two questions. One is -- one's a relatively easy one just with the number of members you're signing up, what we've seen at other companies is when they have some type of discount program, like Best Buy being a good example, there's gross margin pressures; and that's not one of the comments that you mentioned in North American retail or the contract area. Why are you not seeing margin pressure from the members? Rick Lepley - Office Depot, Inc. - EVP, North American Retail The advantage program. Neil Austrian - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman & CEO The advantage program you're talking about. Gary Balter - UBS - Analyst Right, on the advantage program. Chuck Rubin - Office Depot, Inc. - EVP & Chief Merchandising/Marketing Officer Is that correct, Gary, this is the advantage loyalty program? 19 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Earnings Conference Call Gary Balter - UBS - Analyst Yes. Chuck Rubin - Office Depot, Inc. - EVP & Chief Merchandising/Marketing Officer The offers that we're providing to advantage members, the cost of those offers have actually been offset by reductions of other types of promotional pricing that we had done in years past. So we're actually seeing good control of other offers that we have out there and that's how the math has worked out. Gary Balter - UBS - Analyst And then when we look at the overall operating margin which is about 4.05, right on top of that is about a 4.9 corporate expense and that keeps on growing. Can you talk about what's in there, why does it keep on growing and should it be -- is there a point it's going to be allocated and what does that imply for the segment operating profits? Neil Austrian - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman & CEO I think you're referring to G&A costs. Gary Balter - UBS - Analyst Right. Neil Austrian - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman & CEO And the G&A costs are under review right now and I hope that we'll be in a position at the investor conference to share some things with you in terms of some of the changes we're making and some of the reductions that you'll see in G&A going forward. Charlie Brown - Office Depot, Inc. - EVP & CFO Gary, this is Charlie. One of the other things that influences that number this quarter is foreign exchange. We've added the Guilbert numbers and, of course, to the pot and we're translating those at higher exchange rates. So that drives up part of it. Gary Balter - UBS - Analyst Okay. Thank you very much. Operator At this time we have no further questions. 20 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

CONFERENCE CALL PARTICIPANTS Jamelah Leddy McAdams Wright Ragen - Analyst Nicholas Aberle Caris & Company - Analyst Tom Spiro Spiro Capital - Analyst Stewart Scharf Standard & Poor's Corp. - Analyst PRESENTATION Operator Good afternoon and welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the Alexander & Baldwin Inc. first-quarter 2004 earnings conference call. At this time, I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded and that all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the request of the Company, we will open the conference up for questions and answers after the presentation. I will now turn the conference over to John Kelley. Please go ahead, sir. John Kelley - Alexander & Baldwin - IR Contact Good day. This John Kelley in Honolulu. With me are Allen Doane, President and CEO of A&B, Chris Benjamin, CFO and Vice President of A&B, and Jim Andrasick, President and CEO of Matson Navigation Company. As many of you recall, Chris succeeded Jim in the CFO role in early February of this year. As is typical in the call, I will do this brief introduction and then Allen will give an overview of the financial performance and some comments on the outlook. Chris will comment on the financials, and I will give a quick review of the Hawaiian economy and then we will open for your questions by Quick-Q polling. In today's call, we're using slides on our Web site, and I'm on Slide Two right now. You can change the slides from your own PC and we will try to call the changes to help you stay with us. This is an experimental way to give you some exhibits to help you follow subjects that might otherwise be difficult to describe or follow verbally. Fortunately, this is a fairly easy quarter to describe, so we're just trying this technique, and I'd be pleased to hear how you think it helps later on. There are two types of participants; the public is listening in on the Web and we have invitees who are investment professionals on conference call basis, and they will be able to ask questions in the Q&A portion. (Caller Instructions). Copies of our press release are available on the A&B Web site, and invitees on the call should have been faxed or e-mailed copiers earlier today. There will be a replay available on the Web for one week, and I'm willing to take calls on the subject at any time. Please note, at this time of the year, there's a six-hour time difference between ourselves and Honolulu and the East Coast. We will be visiting New York, Philadelphia and Baltimore during the week of May 3rd and will be setting appointments for that trip in the next few days. 2 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

APRIL 23, 2004 / 7:00PM, - Q1 2004 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Moving onto Slide Three, statements in the call set forth our expectations or predictions based on facts and situations that are known to us as of today, April 23, 2004. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties such as those we describe on Page 21 of the Form 10-K in our 2003 annual report. I would also remind listeners of our corporate Web site, www.AlexanderBaldwin.com, and its links to our subsidiaries' Web sites. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Allen Doane for his thoughts. Allen? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO Thank you, John. Let's go immediately to slide number five, earnings per share. We did have a very, very good quarter. You can see the 2003 quarterly earnings on the left bar chart and on the right, of course ,is our 49 percent increase in EPS first quarter '04 versus first quarter '03. We can go to slide number six; it will give you the composition of those earnings. Basically, it's a performance summary, and Matson was on target for the quarter. Our real estate business is above target. That's really a combination of two factors; we had some timing and pull-forwards; essentially, we had more of our sales activity in the first quarter than we had thought we would, but underlying that is better results in our real estate business than we had forecasted. Our Food Products segment, the smallest part of the Company, was a little less than 10 percent of our capital. It did have a production shortfall in the quarter and essentially did not perform all that well. If we could go to slide number seven, it gives the composition of the first-quarter operating profit. There really were two drivers in the year-over-year increase in profit. The first was the increase in Ocean Transportation profitability from 12 million to $18.6 million, and the second was the increase in our property sales and development income from almost 12 million to 19 million. So, those were essentially the two major drivers in the year-over-year improvement in performance for the Company. If we can go to slide number eight, just to reference, first, we will talk about Ocean Transportation at Matson, a very big increase, more than 50 percent year-over-year in the quarter. If we can go to slide number nine, this will give you an idea of where that large increase came from. Our revenues were up about 6 percent; that was a combination of about a 2 percent volume increase with a yield/mix increase of about 4 percent. The cost side of the equation for Matson -- really, there was nothing remarkable in the first quarter of 2004. We had some what we would call unusually high costs in the first quarter of 2003 in the aftermath of a labor disruption that carried over into '03 from the end of 2002. I would remark, as well, that there is an element of seasonality that we've discussed previously. The first quarter is typically the lowest in both margins and absolute earnings for Matson, so we believe that we will be able to improve our margins and our income as we go through the rest of the year. If we can just quickly turn to slide number ten, our logistics business -- very small, 0.5 million of operating profit last year, one million this year. Those numbers are going to grow in absolute terms over the remainder of the year. Our first-quarter is normally the weakest here. Onto slide number 11, the operating profit from our Food Products business, while it shows an increase -- and I think GAAP accounting requires us to show the increase, the underlying performance metrics are not very good for Food Products, which is essentially and primarily composed of our sugar-growing and processing operation on Maui. If we go to slide number 12, you'll note on the left-hand portion of that slide that we produced 206,000 tons of sugar, and you can see the quarterly composition of that in the year 2003. It's important to note that, in 2003 in the first quarter, we produced 19,000 tons of sugar. We start midway through the quarter and then the production gets larger as the year progresses. You can see that we had a very small production of 12,000 tons in the first quarter of 2004. There was a reduction of 37 percent. Not to make an excuse but as an explanation, I believe that we've had just about the wettest first quarter certainly on Maui than we've had in about 50 years, so it's been really difficult for that business to get started. I am not confident, at this point, that we're going to be able to make all of our targets in production for the year at HC&S. 3 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

APRIL 23, 2004 / 7:00PM, - Q1 2004 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call If we go to page 13, our property leasing business, operating profit increased profitability 8.6 million of operating profit in the first quarter of '03, an increase -- a nice increase, actually -- the 9.5 million in the first quarter of '04. Our occupancy rates are up; we've had a little bit of rate-improvement, not much, but there's also an underlying upgrading of our portfolio. As you know, we sell businesses and we buy -- or I should say we sell properties and we buy other properties and we are in a continuous process of upgrading our portfolio. So here, it's more the efficiency of the portfolio than it is any major change in underlying market dynamics. If we can go to number 14, there's a big story here. The operating profit of our property sales and development activity increased from 11.6 to $19 million year-over-year in the quarter. If we go to page 15, sort of overviews on what's going on in our market in Hawaii -- very briefly, the residential market is very strong  red hot would, I guess, be an apt description. The commercial market has not been that strong but it is strengthening and certainly, we're seeing some improvement in most aspects of commercial properties. The flip side of that, at least in the short run is, that while it's a great time to be a seller, and we are selling, it's not the greatest time to be a buyer. We have not, at this point, closed any major investments or acquisitions in real estate in the first quarter, and I am not in a position to tell you when we will but certainly, the dynamics of the marketplace have shifted somewhat from the last few years. If I can now speak for a few moments in conclusion about several of the larger projects where we've made major investments in recent years and give you an update, the first would be on slide number 16, Alakea Corporate Tower. There, we closed 7.5 floors. This is a 31-floor office tower that we bought just a year ago for $20 million; we've sold 7.5 in the quarter. Altogether, we've sold 15.5, which is exactly one-half of the building. We've had a return of about $17.6 million on our investment, obviously before taxes. We think that sales are going to slow now after the initial rush but this project has been tremendously successful and it's a very, very positive picture there. Go to slide 17. This is our wholly-owned development on Waikiki. This is the first high rise residential condo to be developed by anyone in Waikiki in almost 15 years -- Lanikea. Of the 100 units in this development, 99 have binding contracts and sale. We have had a concrete strike in Hawaii; it lasted six weeks. We believe our project is about four weeks behind schedule but that the cost impact will be pretty minimal from this delay. The project is going to be expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2005, so we're going to wait a little time for that one, but everything is going very well. For those of you on the net looking at this, this is an aerial photo on the right of the construction site with a rendition of what the building is going to look like on the left. The next is the Hokua Luxury High Rise development in Honolulu. We've talked about that a couple of times. That is a 50-50 joint venture. Two hundred thirty-seven of the 247 units have binding contracts. Again, this project was affected by the concrete strike; it's also running about four weeks behind schedule. Here, the completion of that project will be sometime around the end of -- we think sometime near the end of 2005 or the beginning of 2006. That is a project that has an average of about $1 million per unit of sales revenue, so it's a $250 million-plus development -- everything going well there. The next slide, slide 19, is a scenic -- I guess you would call it -- from our Wailea project. Slide 20 is as well. I think you'll find slide 21 to be kind interesting for those of you who have it; it's identified as Wailea Parcels, and it's essentially an aerial of the 17 sub-divided parcels that the Company acquired last October, comprising 270 acres of developable property. We had very good news and reported it in our earnings release. We had -- when we bought the property, there were 29 single-family home sites that had been already developed by the early -- previous owner. These involved about ten acres of land, but it's essentially the only ready-to-go, fully developed residential product that we have. These lots were put up for sale. Twenty-one closed in the quarter; 27 of the lots have -- 21 have been closed; six are in escrow; there are two available for sale. Of the 21 that have closed, the average sales price has been about $900,000. If you kind of run an extension on that, we are estimating we're going to have proceeds from sale of about $26 million on this one parcel against our total investment of $67 million. I would caution, however, not to extend this for all of the acreage. More representative of the value of the property and what we're going to do with it is the ability to develop or sell these parcels, in effect, on a more bulk basis. 4 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

APRIL 23, 2004 / 7:00PM, - Q1 2004 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call In April, actually, we have been successful in closing our first bulk parcel. It's a nine-acre parcel that you can see just to the right called 10-F-15 (ph) on this aerial view. It's a nine-acre parcel. We sold it for about twice the $250,000 basis that we acquired it for. So, we do have a couple of other bulk parcels that we are in the process of selling. We are also in the development stage of a 25-acre parcel that we plan to develop with a partner. So, everything is going very well there. With that, John, I will turn it over to Chris Benjamin. Chris Benjamin - Alexander & Baldwin - CFO Thank you, Allen. I will be commenting on the financial statements included with the press release. I will begin on Slide 23 with a few comments about the income statement and some below-the-line items. First of all, interest expense for the first quarter was up about $700,000 year-over-year as a result of debt levels that are about $43 million higher than they were at March 31, 2003. I will comment further on debt in just a minute. Our expected tax review for the year is 37.5 percent compared with the statutory rate of 38.1 percent. This lower rate reflects the impact of tax credits. The year-over-year increase in average shares outstanding of 900,000 reflects principally option exercises during that time period. Moving to Slide 24, we had fairly modest changes in our balance sheet in this quarter compared to year-end 2003, but I would like to point a couple of items, starting on the asset side. The $14 million increase in investments reflects primarily a $13 million increase in our Hokua joint venture investment as a result of preferred equity drawls, which support ongoing construction activity. Our Hokua investment is now at about $23 million of a total eventual $40 million investment. An $18 million reduction in property is the result of depreciation outpacing capital expenditures for the quarter, as well as the transfer of some land to real estate developments, which resulted in increase in that line item. On the liabilities slide and moving to slide 25, our total debt at March 31st, including the current portion, was 335 million, compared to 334 million at year-end. This change reflects normal debt repayments. The increase in shareholders' equity, of course, reflects primarily in net income for the quarter of 27 million. On Slide 26, I will comment on our debt. As you know, we had an active investment program in 2003 with the purchase of a new vessel and the Wailea property being the two biggest components. With the delivery of a second vessel later this year, we do expect to take on some new debt but also will be using funds from our capital construction fund for a significant portion of the vessel purchase. We have authorization for up to $75 million of Title 11 financing for the second ship but don't expect to use that full amount. Other net borrowings or repayments for the balance of the year will depend largely on our real estate-investing activity for the balance of the year. On Slide 27 is a photo of the ship I just mentioned, the M.V Margaret Lilly (ph), which is under construction in Philadelphia. This will be the newest member of the Matson family and it is expected to be in service by the fourth quarter of this year. On Slide 28, going back to the financials, the cash-flow statement -- you will note the $43 million year-over-year increase in operating cash flows, which is attributable, of course, to higher earnings, as well as the sales of real estate assets held-for-sale, which increased our cash from operations. Finally, the $9 million swing in the all/other category is primarily a result of the increase in our Hokua investment that I mentioned a moment ago. To conclude my remarks, on Slide 29, I'd like to give you some insight into our capital expenditure budget for 2004. Before I start, let me point out that these numbers do not include 10-31 exchanges of property but do represent all the new capital being invested in our businesses. 5 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

APRIL 23, 2004 / 7:00PM, - Q1 2004 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call In aggregate, our expected capital spending for 2004 resembles 2003, largely because both years include a $100 million vessel acquisition. The next-largest piece of Matson's capital budget for this year, 2000/2003 (ph), is about $20 million of container equipment. The rest of Matson's spending for each year is comprised of several smaller items, including Information Systems and other vessel-related expenditures. At Properties, our capital spending is always unpredictable because we don't know what acquisition or JV opportunities may develop. The $81 million shown on this slide does not include any acquisition capital and as Allen mentioned a moment ago, we have not yet close any transactions. This, of course, could increase if we take on any new investments during the year. We have budgeted about a little over $70 million for Hawaii development activity, including the projects that Allen referenced a few moments ago. The balance of our properties capital budget shown on the slide goes towards maintenance and improvements of our income portfolio. Finally, our Food Products capital budget is in line with last year. With that, I'd like to turn it back to John Kelley, who will provide some insights on the economic outlook for Hawaii. John Kelley - Alexander & Baldwin - IR Contact Thanks, Chris. I'm on slide 30, and I'm just going to talk through some bullet points. The growth rates in several measures are slowing slightly, and I think this primarily results from some short-term deceleration -- personal income, the job count and a little bit in construction that I'll touch on. Looking from not far ahead, though, I think the key is that we're still operating in what I would consider the economic sweet spot for the economy in an island community, and there are some new factors that I expect to see kick-in and bring the pace back up. First of all, we are expecting some military housing replacement and refurbishment programs to begin to contribute to the economy shortly and a bit of a wild-card is out there that I'm seeing a number of gradual improvements in measures of Japanese economic progress. To the extent that Japan strengthens and the fact that we have not really expected much from Japan in a long time, that would provide support certainly to the visitor numbers and retail spending and business confidence, at the very least. I will go on now to talk about some items relating to the visitor industry, consumer durables, construction, and the real GS outlook. On 32, I have to apologize; there's a typo in the first line. It should be the fourth quarter. We are talking about visitor industry metrics. In the fourth quarter of '03, the total of all visitors was up about 4/10 of 1 percent. That was the net result of a good increase in domestic travelers, which represents about two-thirds of the market. That was up about 3 percent. International travelers with a very sizable portion of that number of folks coming from Japan, down 5 percent, and that is roughly a little as than one-third of the market. That trend is improving as we go forward in time. February was better; that's the latest full-month data we've got. The total was up 6 percent with the domestic portion up 11 and the international still lagging about 4 percent. In the short run, this bounces around an awful lot. For example, in the seven days ending April 15th, the total visitors, excluding Canada, was up about 8 percent and Japan amazingly was up 48 percent for that seven-day period, and the domestic market was up 3. So, there is some statistical noise in that short run that smoothes out on a quarterly basis. For the year, the forecast from the state agency Department of Business and Economic Development and Tourism expects about a 5 percent increase for '04 and about a 3.5 percent increase for calendar year '05. We've been watching the yen primarily because, in the last few months, it has come off about 110 to the dollar basis and in the last 13 weeks or in the 13 weeks in the first quarter, it ranged from about 105 to 109, still helpful for Japanese visitors coming here for their retail and expenditure levels. On hotel occupancy, the fourth quarter saw a nice increase -- fourth quarter of '03 saw a nice increase from about 67 percent in the prior year's fourth quarter to about 71 percent in the fourth quarter of '03, or about a little more than 400 basis points. The month of February had a slightly larger increase, about 510 basis points, from 78 to about just 83.5 percent. Another measure of visitor activity, Canadian Airline operating out of Vancouver just announced an increase in capacity of about 67,000 annual seats. They will be serving both Honolulu and Maui with a greater number of flights coming in the winter months, reflecting, no doubt, their climate. 6 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

APRIL 23, 2004 / 7:00PM, - Q1 2004 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Moving on to 33, in the last call, I commented a little bit about total auto registrations. This is statewide and it reflects, I think, one measure of consumer optimism, perhaps interest rates, and there's also a tie to the visitor industry via rentals. But in the last call, the Auto Dealers Association was expecting about a 12.7 percent increase between '03 and '02 in total registrations. In fact, the actual numbers came in at 17.6 percent, considerably higher. Their expectations at our last call were about a 2.5 percent growth between '03 and '04. That's been raised more recently to a 7 percent increase, so overall, the expectations for '04 registrations are up about 5,700 cars, which is certainly a positive view for those of us in the car transportation business. Moving on to Slide 34, some comments about construction -- I mentioned earlier the contracting tax base, which is a proxy for construction activity. It came down a couple of percent in the fourth quarter but from a very high-level; it's still about a $1.1 billion rate. The construction job count in the fourth quarter was up 5.5 percent and it reflected increases in three of the four island economies. Maui was down slightly but from a fairly high level. Residential house authorizations were up about 2 percent on value in the fourth quarter and almost 18 percent on units. It's reflecting continuing strength in the residential construction and the demand for residential. Then on Oahu, resales of existing single-family homes and condominiums in the first quarter, very active -- up 37 percent on dollar volume to $907 million. Then I mentioned earlier these military refurbishment and replacement homes. It's a long-term effort to both physically do to construction and refurbishment and then manage the homes, going forward, a total of about 16,000 dwellings, three large contracts involved. Putting this all together, again using the Department of Business and Economic Development's forecast on Slide 35, the outlook for real gross state product is now for an increase of about 2.6 percent, and that's about 20 basis points off their forecast 13 weeks ago. For '05, the forecast is for plus 2.4 percent real and that forecast is unchanged. One factor is they are beginning to expect a slightly higher inflation rate, particularly because of the pricing in housing. With that, I'll move to Slide 36. Operator, I think we are about ready to open the call for questions. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Operator Thank you, sir. The question-and-answer session will begin at this time. (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). Jamelah Leddy with McAdams Wright. Jamelah Leddy - McAdams Wright Ragen - Analyst Hi. Excellent quarter. I have a question, first of all, in terms of the margin on your property sales. It was in the 40 percent range. I'm wondering if you expect to see that type of margin continue. John Kelley - Alexander & Baldwin - IR Contact Yes. Thank you for the question and thank you for the comments at the beginning. No, you're not going to -- the range varies greatly on margins and property sales. We can have one project that can have 15 or 20 percent margins; another can have 60 percent, so the mix differs tremendously. We had such a high proportion of land sales at Wailea, where we are in fact having a huge margin, but that gave us an unusually high margin number. 7 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

APRIL 23, 2004 / 7:00PM, - Q1 2004 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Jamelah Leddy - McAdams Wright Ragen - Analyst Okay, that makes sense. Do you have a feel -- are you willing to share with us the timing of the additional parcel sales of Wailea throughout this next year? John Kelley - Alexander & Baldwin - IR Contact I can't tell you specifically what the numbers are going to be, but I can give you a general idea. We are fairly far along in several other -- two to three other sales at this point in time, in addition to the one that we've just completed in April that I mentioned. We are also working quite hard on a development of our own with a partner, so we're going to be in a position that the sale, on a bulk basis of these parcels, the completion of these Golf Vista sales to reduce the basis at our property dramatically and then be in a position with much of the land remaining to develop it on a more -- what I would call a more regular, orderly basis. Jamelah Leddy - McAdams Wright Ragen - Analyst Have you, at this point, determined if the remaining land to be developed would be sold off in parcels or developed internally, or are you just going to kind of take your time on that decision? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO We've gotten to the point where we've identified what we're going to do with about one-half of the 17 parcels, so we got a pretty specific idea about halfway through the process. What we do after that is going to have a lot to do with how we do in our first half and what the market looks like. But yes, we have actually, from the beginning, had a very completely organized approach towards, first, how we were going to significantly reduce the basis in this property. I did mention, when we announced the purchase, that this was not going to be dilutive, which is something that's a little bit unusual when you are buying raw land. We are proceeding to do pretty much what we said but I think market conditions are quite favorable, so it's going quite well. Jamelah Leddy - McAdams Wright Ragen - Analyst That's excellent. Would you consider purchasing property, should it become available, such as the Wailea acquisition or some of the other key properties that you discussed during your conference call, on the mainland, given that the Hawaiian real estate environment is a difficult environment to be a buyer? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO You know, we've had lots of discussions about exactly who we are and what we are capable of. There is a possibility that, strategically, we could be expanding and do some investment development work probably on the West Coast. There are a couple of markets there that we're pretty familiar with. I don't think we're going to go through some Helter Skelter kind of growth in that area. The fact is that we really know what we're doing in Hawaii; we're not perfect but we definitely have a market advantage in terms of our knowledge. So in some ways, higher interest rates and less-favorable conditions will make it better for us to be in the acquisition market. Jamelah Leddy - McAdams Wright Ragen - Analyst Okay. Why were the margins so high in your sugar business? I understand it was down sequentially in terms of production, but margins were quite high! 8 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

APRIL 23, 2004 / 7:00PM, - Q1 2004 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO Margins were high, and it's really an anomaly. We don't produce very much sugar, so we can only book what we produce, but we did sell a lot of power in the quarter. It's a really odd situation, electrical power. It's really odd that we can see that we're having problems with production. When we do produce the sugar later on, it's going to be at a higher cost, so we're going to have some profit issues there. But in the meantime, in the first quarter, we sold a lot of power. That, among other things, gave us margins that were -- I hate to use the word 'deceptive' in public but certainly it was not representative of what the underlying economics of the business would be but is totally consistent with GAAP. Jamelah Leddy - McAdams Wright Ragen - Analyst Okay, that makes sense. Turning quickly to (indiscernible) and let someone else ask some questions. John Kelley - Alexander & Baldwin - IR Contact Good! (LAUGHTER) (indiscernible). Jamelah Leddy - McAdams Wright Ragen - Analyst On a sequential basis, obviously margins were down, as it's a seasonal business. It sounded like you talked a little bit about some higher expenses in the quarter, but I guess margins were down a little bit more than I had expected. I'm wondering if -- I know you don't give specific forecasts but is the general trend if we should expect to see Matson getting back to maybe some of the margin levels that you've historically achieved? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO Jim Andrasick, please? Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - President of Matson Navigation Co. Yes, thanks for the question. The first quarter is seasonally our lowest, and I think history bears that out. If I could just cite last year's experience, the second quarter was -- excuse me, it's a high fixed cost business, as you are aware, so as seasonal volumes improve quarter-by-quarter-by quarter, we would expect to get back to, I think, a historical range, which previously we said was about 11 to 12 percent on the high side. There is nothing untoward going on in our business that would -- that I can see that would preclude that kind of performance. We are still making -- before I get the question -- we're still making steady progress at our Sand Island facility and right now, the fleet is (indiscernible) levels that really have never been better for the last 2.5, 3 years. So, I hope that answers your question. Jamelah Leddy - McAdams Wright Ragen - Analyst That's great. Thank you very much.

APRIL 23, 2004 / 7:00PM, - Q1 2004 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Nicholas Aberle - Caris & Company - Analyst Hello, congrats on the quarter, guys. First question -- I guess I've got a couple of follow-ups for Jim on Matson. You recently announced rates were being raised in the Guam service. Can you just give us a little bit more color on what that can mean for the topline, going forward and then quickly comment as well on the westbound service rates that were raised at the end of 2003 and how those are taking? Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - President of Matson Navigation Co. Certainly. In both cases, the rates were principally in the form of what we call a terminal handling charge to help us recover a portion of the costs related to both our West Coast and Hawaiian and now our Guam port activities and cargo-handling activities. The Hawaii service rates at the beginning of the year have held quite well. We don't comment on particularly the segments of our service, but I would just categorize it by saying that they've held quite well. This is not the type of rate increase that we intended to be bargained up or down, but it's a true reflection of absolute cost increases that we see in our business. As far as the Guam increase, there's not much color to it. The Company has not raised rates there for six or seven years, so it does reflect -- in the theater of international rates in the Pacific trade, I guess it's a very small change. We pointed that out in our press release, but on average, I believe it's about a 4 percent increase. What that goes to the topline -- I don't believe we break out our revenues that way for public consumption, so I can just say that it's a modest increase and we don't expect any push-back on that. Nicholas Aberle - Caris & Company - Analyst I got it. With horizon lines rumored to be on the block, Carslyle (ph) shopping this thing, how could that affect business or the competitive environment, going forward? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO Jim, why don't you comment on that first? Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - President of Matson Navigation Co. Clearly, first of all, for the benefit of the other listeners, Horizon Lines is (indiscernible) principle competitor in the Hawaii service and in the Guam service, so it's certainly an important factor for us. The financial well-being of a competitor is certainly a factor in the market dynamics, and I would say that we have no specific information about the status of the rumored sale. I believe that, from our perspective, Horizon Lines continues to be a very good and agile competitor to us in both services. So we're just standing back at this point and just observing. That's all I can say about that. Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO I have no additional comments to make on that. Nicholas Aberle - Caris & Company - Analyst Allen, is there any chance of the Food Products segment being a loss for the remainder of the year, due to the poor environment there? 10 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

APRIL 23, 2004 / 7:00PM, - Q1 2004 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO Yes, there's a chance but I don't think there's a likelihood. It's not going to be a good year and our projections are a year that's going to have a fairly small marginal amount of profitability, but we are doing an awful lot there to see if we can get our production back on track. The costs are completely under control, so it's just a matter of getting production going. But I would not expect us to be in a loss position. Nicholas Aberle - Caris & Company - Analyst okay. Any update you can provide with respect to a potential dividend increase in 2004? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO There's really not much of an update. The Board did declare a quarterly dividend which, on an annual rate, is 90 cents per share. The view, at this time, is that that is still a good dividend yield, about 2.7 percent, and based on last year's earnings, about a 46 percent payout ratio. So, given the investment needs of the Company, where we have some essential needs in terms of the two vessel replacements that have been undertaken or are being undertaken now and the real estate investments that we are already committed to, plus what I would call the somewhat-opportunistic nature of our real estate activity where it's good to be in a financially flexible position that, at the moment, the view of the Board and certainly that of management as well is that we are going to stay with the dividend at 90 cents a share. Nicholas Aberle - Caris & Company - Analyst That's going to obviously be reviewed on a quarterly basis, going forward, but your comment just basically says that, at the present time, it doesn't seem like a plausible solution. Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO Well, the Board does make a determination each quarter, and it is within the province of the Board to establish the dividend policy of the Company. Nicholas Aberle - Caris & Company - Analyst I got it. All right, thank you very much. Operator Tom Spiro with Spiro Capital. Tom Spiro - Spiro Capital - Analyst Aloha! First, on the Matson, did the concrete strike affect Matson's volumes much in the quarter? Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - President of Matson Navigation Co. No, I would say no. We don't handle any of the bulk -- certainly not the bulk materials that go into the manufacture of concrete. I believe that, as far as the supply-side, it was not a material difference for us. A lot of the bulk materials like 2-by-4s and other lumber comes in by barge and we don't handle that type of cargo currently on a -- for the time-sensitive materials that go into construction. So, I would say that, generically, it's had very little affect on Matson's business. 11 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

APRIL 23, 2004 / 7:00PM, - Q1 2004 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Tom Spiro - Spiro Capital - Analyst Can you give us an update on both Fosha (ph) and the acquisition of the new boat, please? Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - President of Matson Navigation Co. Yes, I certainly can. From all public reports, Fosha (ph) has I think announced that the vessel will enter the Hawaii trade in the fourth quarter of this year. For Matson's part, we continue to upgrade our vehicle service. We've discussed previously our charter-in of a rolo (ph) vessel which went into service in October of last year. We've expanded the garage capacity on another one of our liner vessels, which combined took us up to about 50 percent railroad capacity. One of the capital projects, which Chris mentioned earlier, was really dedicated to Information Technology to improve, for our auto customers, their ability to track vehicle shipments and to enable them to do many more things downstream. We're spending $4 million on that particular project, which is under development right now. Of course, we've established separate terminal operations in both Oakland and in Honolulu to sort of facilitate vehicle business, but we are preparing for the entry and that's all I can really say about it at this point. Tom Spiro - Spiro Capital - Analyst And the new boat? Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - President of Matson Navigation Co. The Margaret Lily (ph)? That continues under budget and on-time as far as we're concerned and as Chris said, we expect entry into the Hawaii service early in the fourth quarter of this year. Tom Spiro - Spiro Capital - Analyst What's been your experience with the boat you put into service four our five months ago? Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - President of Matson Navigation Co. It's been excellent. As far as the actual operating specifications, it meet all of its speed and fuel-consumption requirements. Like any complex piece of machinery, there are open items that need to be corrected. There's a one-year warranty period essentially to accomplish all of that. I would say our overall experience, based on the crew comments, has been very positive. Tom Spiro - Spiro Capital - Analyst Shifting over to real estate for a moment, the occupancy rate of the Hawaii properties I see is about 90 percent. What is the likelihood that we can boost that up a couple of points in a strengthening environment? John Kelley - Alexander & Baldwin - IR Contact Certainly possible, Tom. It's possible. 12 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

APRIL 23, 2004 / 7:00PM, - Q1 2004 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Tom Spiro - Spiro Capital - Analyst Is there one particular property or category of properties that keeps the rate down in the 90s? John Kelley - Alexander & Baldwin - IR Contact Yes. Do you want to know what is? (LAUGHTER). Tom Spiro - Spiro Capital - Analyst Sure, you read my mind. John Kelley - Alexander & Baldwin - IR Contact Yes, it's the office property market. We have a little bit of a mainland phenomenon here of office vacancy that is right now at about a 12 or 13 percent rate in Honolulu. Essentially, the industrial market has no vacancy, so that is very, very strong. The retail market is relatively strong, so if we are going to get an uplift in occupancy, it's going to come into several of our office properties that are somewhat mirroring broader occupancy rates. The good news, if it is any on that, is that we didn't buy these office buildings at really high prices, so we can handle lower occupancy rates than perhaps some others who acquired them on a different basis. Tom Spiro - Spiro Capital - Analyst Allen, I know the Company has spent a fair amount of money over the last I guess it's for our five years, since 1999, buying real estate in Hawaii. Roughly how much have we spent over that timeframe in Hawaii? Do you have a rough number? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO Well, I do, but it also depends on how you count it, Tom. If you use the most narrow definition -- and I will give you an example; that Hokua project is one where we have, in effect, a 50 percent interest in what is about a $250 million real estate activity, and our capital in that is about $40 million. So, on the basis of just our at-risk money, our total investment has been north of $400 million. Tom Spiro - Spiro Capital - Analyst That's just cost-basis? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO Yes. Tom Spiro - Spiro Capital - Analyst To whatever extent Hawaii or real estate is appreciated, it would be reflected in growth over 400? 13 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

APRIL 23, 2004 / 7:00PM, - Q1 2004 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO Well, yes, and to the extent we haven't sold what we've invested because, over this period of time, Tom, there have been 19 investment that we've made in these last five years that differ from what we used to do because they are not on Company lands, so they are in Hawaii but they are not our traditional landholding. Several of those projects, we've actually gone through the whole investment cycle where we've spent $30 million or more, on a couple of occasions, to develop residential projects. So, we will put the money in, we will get the return, and then there's no basis there. So, when I give you a number, as I did, it's really a number that's based on how much incremental investment we've made, not how much we have in-place right now, which we don't disclose. Tom Spiro - Spiro Capital - Analyst I see. Okay, thank you. Operator Stewart Scharf with Standard & Poor's. Stewart Scharf - Standard & Poor's Corp. - Analyst I'd like to know, firstly, what your average borrowing costs are. Chris Benjamin - Alexander & Baldwin - CFO Yes, Stewart. At this time, our average borrowing, our average debt interest rate is about 4 percent. That combines an average of about 6.2 percent on our fixed-rate borrowings and about 1.2 percent average rate now on our variable borrowing. Stewart Scharf - Standard & Poor's Corp. - Analyst Okay. Are you planning to use cash mostly to pay down debt, or do you have any interest in buying back stock? I know you have that authorization for a long time and you haven't really gone into that market. Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO In terms of the stock buyback question, we have authorization to buy back up to 2 million shares of stock. We have not been active in buybacks recently. I would say that, if you look at the last five years of history, that is certainly a tool that the Company has used at the appropriate time, and we could use it again. It's one way to return value to shareholders. Stewart Scharf - Standard & Poor's Corp. - Analyst Okay. Anything new with the fuel charges? Any changes that you're looking into regarding the volatile fuel market? Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - President of Matson Navigation Co. I think Matson has certainly tried to keep pace with changes, and we are currently at an 8 percent fuel surcharge -- (technical difficulty) -- have experienced year-over-year during the first quarter about $1.40 a barrel increase in our average costs, so we think we are current now. Certainly, 14 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

APRIL 23, 2004 / 7:00PM, - Q1 2004 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call the trends still appear to be upward. This doesn't seem to be enough refining capacity to meet the demands of an expanding economy. We use the residual portion of the tracking process for our primary fuel in most of our ships, so we expect to see further increases but I can't begin to predict how much. Stewart Scharf - Standard & Poor's Corp. - Analyst Okay, thank you very much. Operator Tom Spiro with Spiro Capital. Tom Spiro - Spiro Capital - Analyst Just to stay with the subject of financing for a moment, perhaps we are in an environment where interest rates will start to go up. Do you have any plans to fix some of your floating-rate debt? Do you have any plans to lock in the cost of the Title 11 financing now? What are your thoughts? Chris Benjamin - Alexander & Baldwin - CFO We do have a rate lock on our Title 11 financing for the new vessel, so that we are protected on. We also will look at opportunities, although we fixed a fair amount of debt last year and really have relatively little at this time, but certainly as we -- of variable-rate borrowings, outside of our commercial paper program, which I think you are familiar with. As we make additional investments this year, we will evaluate opportunities to use fixed-rate borrowings if it seems appropriate. Tom Spiro - Spiro Capital - Analyst Allen, you mentioned it, on a couple of our Hawaiian properties, we have binding contracts on a variety of apartments and such. I'm not quite sure what it means to have a binding contract. Under what terms or at what extent can a buyer walk away? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO Tom, there are some very limited conditions. I hesitate on a call like this to give you what would have to be a very legalistic response to the question, and we will give you that answer specifically. The general principle is that they are binding in terms of the amount of down payment that has been -- the refunding of the down payment, which is substantial for these units. So the party is at risk of losing the deposits that have been made if they walk away. The principle risk you have is that it is necessary to complete the construction, once you've signed a contract, within 24 months of when that contract has been signed with the buying party. So, that's kind of what you have to watch out for, Tom, is to make sure that you are able to deliver that development in that time period. Now, I would say that if, for example, this strike that occurred in concrete -- there is a force majeure provision associated with that 24-month period that would exclude, so you would be able to extend the 24 months for an event like that. So, that's kind of the major dynamic of it, but we can send you the description of it. They are pretty strong. 15 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

APRIL 23, 2004 / 7:00PM, - Q1 2004 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Tom Spiro - Spiro Capital - Analyst One other question on the real estate -- Allen, you mentioned that the real estate sales in Q1 were ahead of budget. I wasn't sure whether that was merely a timing matter, that the transactions which you expected to occur later will occur later in the year just were moved up to Q1 (sic), or whether in a more fundamental sense the sales process was going better than expected. Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO I hope you weren't going to ask that question, Tom! (LAUGHTER). It's both. There was a major positive variance in the quarter and a little more than half of it was timing, so you can figure out that a little less than half of it was just better performance. Tom Spiro - Spiro Capital - Analyst Thanks a lot. Good luck! Operator (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). If there are no further questions, I will turn the conference back to Mr. Kelley. John Kelley - Alexander & Baldwin - IR Contact Thank you very much for participating. For those of you on the East Coast, I realize it's fairly late on a Friday afternoon. We appreciate it. Aloha!

CORPORATE PARTICIPANTS Bruce Nelson Office Depot - Chairman & CEO Charlie Brown Office Depot - EVP & CFO CONFERENCE CALL PARTICIPANTS Colin McGranahan Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Retail Hardlines Analyst PRESENTATION Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Retail Hardlines Analyst Good morning. We're going to go ahead and get started to try and keep on schedule here. A couple housekeeping items to get going. You should have cards on your seats. Those are for questions. They will be collected at the end for the Q&A period. And if you could please also turn your cellphones to vibrate or off, I would appreciate that. My name is Colin McGranahan. I am the retail hardlines analyst here at Bernstein. It's my pleasure this morning to introduce Office Depot. And Bruce Nelson, who is the Chairman and CEO, will be presenting this morning. Bruce has a lifetime of experience in the office products sector. He began his career in I believe 1968 at Boise Cascade and spent 22 years with that company, but also served as the President and CEO of BT Office Products and the President and COO of Viking Office Products. And Bruce joined Office Depot in 1998 through the acquisition of Viking and was named the CEO in July of 2000 and Chairman of the Board in December 2001. It's a pleasure to have Office Depot back here at the SDC again this year. And also this year we have the pleasure of having Charlie Brown, the CFO, with us, as well as Chuck Rubin, who is Office Depot's new Chief Merchandising Officer, and of course Sean McHugh for investor relations. Bruce? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman & CEO Thank you Colin. Good morning. A lifetime experience is a polite way to say I'm old. I have been in the industry all my life, some 35 or 36 years. I should by telling you I do like this business a lot (indiscernible) I will talk about that in the second. The business model that we have and some others seem at the surface to be simple, but it's really quite complex -- different customers, different sizes, different channels and different brands in different countries. So let me tell you briefly a little bit about the company. I am not going to spend a lot of time on who we are and what we do. I'm going to give you some insight into the four or five things we think really drive future shareholder value, and I'll spend most time on those. And I will do my best to do this in a timeframe that gives you a chance to ask me questions before we conclude. The Safe Harbor statement, I won't read it to you. You have seen it 100 times. I endorse it and I want you to know you've all looked at it. So I don't want to make light of it, but I won't go through the process of reading it word by word. Who are we? Most of you know us well. We are over $12 billion, we are of global; we are multi-channel so we sell through retail stores, through e-commerce, through catalogs, through a virtual seller called 4Sure.com, and through large customers through an outside sales force, and through seats on seats (ph) where we sell outbound telemarketing. We sell customers of all sizes. It is predominantly B2B. Business is highly based on small, medium and large businesses around the world. This is a diversified portfolio which I will show you in a second, and we do have and continue to have the leadership in worldwide e-commerce, an important part of our business. I will share more insights with that. And the reality is no one sells more office products to more customers in more countries than does Office Depot. 2 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Bernstein & Co. 20th Annual Strategic Decisions Conference 2004 Three key segments we talk about a lot -- our international group, about $2.7 billion in revenue. It is contract, catalog, e-commerce and some retail. Retail is the least part of our international business. We go to market with Office Depot, Viking direct, as it's called, and our acquisition of a year ago called Guilbert. And we do that in 21 countries around the world. Our North American business services group consists of our contract operations. That's our outside sales force; about 13, 1400 people in the US that call on Fortune 100 companies through an outside managed sales force. We go to market with catalogs -- Office Depot brand and Viking brand -- and a company called 4Sure.com, and that's our business services group. And again, the core customer is a business customer, in this case from the small, medium to the very large national and growing global accounts. And finally, we have North American retail stores, a little over 900 of those; 5.7 billion of those 2002 revenue. We are in 46 states, heavily concentrated in three areas -- California, Texas and Florida is where the heart of most of our stores are. I will speak to what that means in a minute and some of our future direction. This portfolio balances us both in terms of revenue and sales. Strategically since the acquisition of Viking, which I was a part of in 1998, it's been our objective to balance our portfolio so that we have a more equal balance between retail, BSG here in North America and international. And we've done that extremely well. On your right hand side, the sales mix, 46 percent of our business is retail, 29 percent of our operating profits come from retail, 32 BSG, 36 percent and 22 percent of our revenue comes outside United States, 35 percent of our operating income. You will get some insight to that. Our international business has always been admired by most competitors. We are best in class in most of the business we are in and we continue to grow that business well. As I said earlier, we have a global leadership in e-commerce. Some data on that -- about two-thirds of our North American business services group business comes through the net. The advantage of that is our customers get timely response, they get rich information, customized Web sites. We build purchasing decisions into the Web sites. It takes cost out of our business because it means we have less people in call centers and less customer service help, and it's really self-service. It is about two-thirds of our business. We think that can grow to about 80 percent of our business. In Europe only about 20 our 25 percent of our business comes through e-commerce -- huge opportunity to grow. Guilbert, the company we acquired a year ago, they had less than 10 or 15 percent of this business through e-commerce. We believe we can leverage our e-commerce platform, drive business through the net, provide customers a better experience, more information and at the same time reduce costs. We have been the leader in this business. We continue to invest. We continue to be the leader. This business segment has always been profitable -- always, for the last four or five years, been profitable. It is a key part of how we go to market. We have seven key strategies. I'm not going to go through all of these. I just want you to understand that these seven key strategies are known worldwide by our 50,000 associates. Each one of them I believe could articulate pretty clearly what they are and what they mean, and hopefully each one of them could articulate how they fit into one of the seven strategies and what activities and functions and focus they have that drives these. We measures these, we set goals down the level (ph). We're just committed to execute these seven things -- reposition North American real estate; control costs while enhancing quality; customer centric experience; differentiated product; Excel in Europe; high-performance organization through leadership and training; and build or acquire new businesses. I'm not going to talk about all seven. Instead what I would like to talk about are the four I think -- or elements of the four -- that really make a difference and where our focus really is. These four things I'm going to spend some time on in-depth. They're not quite in priority order, but they're pretty close -- reposition our North American real estate portfolio; enhance the customer and product profitability; develop differentiated product assortments -- that's challenging in an industry in which there's not a lot of product differentiation; and finally, Excel in Europe. Let me speak a little bit about our North American real estate portfolio. Remember, it's 46 percent of our business worldwide. It is a bigger percent of our business than that here in North America. But it's what we are known for - it is our brand, it is our image and it's 900 stores. Three key elements to this strategy -- ramp up or increase the number of new store openings -- I will give you some data in a minute; remodel our older stores to accelerate comp growth and utilize our acquisition of the Kids-R-Us site to enter unsaturated northeastern markets, which have about one-third of the US GDP in which we feel today we compete in a very, very small way. Let's talk about store portfolio and age and a little insight into our portfolio. First of all, you all know this -- older stores comp less. Generally speaking today an Office Depot store on average reaches comp maturity at five years. On a generalized basis then when a store is five years old it tends not 3 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved. Republication or redistribution of Thomson Reuters content, including by framing or similar means, is prohibited without the prior written consent of Thomson Reuters.

Bernstein & Co. 20th Annual Strategic Decisions Conference 2004 to comp positive any longer. Its operating profit sometimes continues to rise, but it doesn't have comp growth for a lot of reasons. One (indiscernible) and it might be older; it might be a little out of position in the market. And two, it might have been cannibalized either by ourselves and/or a competitor. And three, the market has moved. The small-business market has relocated itself and the store may or may not be in exactly the right position. Over 70 percent of Office Depot stores are older than five years. Roughly speaking, generally speaking, that means that almost 70 percent of our 900 stores do not comp positive. You can then get some insight as to why then it's really challenging with an older store base to drive comps. The other piece of that which could mitigate that over time is retailers like ourselves reinvest capital in remodeling. In the past three years because we have tested different formats and up until now have been uncomfortable with the returns, we've only remodeled less than 30 stores at Office Depot in the last three years. We've done that strategically. We've tested and tried different formats, but couldn't satisfy ourselves that we could get adequate return on capital, and therefore we were slow in remodeling stores through North America. The second part of our portfolio is interesting. This is a the competitive overlap. The take away from this slide is you focus on the red, just to give you comparison. To compare us against the market cap leader entry (ph) Staples, Staples has about twice as many store percentages (ph) -- almost 40 percent of their stores do not have an office store competitor within five miles, almost 40 percent. That's twice as many as Office Depot. I can tell you a lot about our stores that are in markets in which we don't have another office supply superstore within five miles. They are more profitable, they comp greater, they are better penetration, customer loyalty is stronger. They're just better stores and that make sense because you don't face a direct competitor. So this is part of our real estate portfolio that we work hard to overcome and why it speaks to repositioning the portfolio. As I said earlier, -- that third piece, I would add, is that we have also lagged opening new stores here in North America for the same reason. We have for the past three years slowed down the opening of new stores. We've opened 101 new stores in the last three years in North America, closed almost as many, so on a net basis we really have 22 more stores at the end of 2003 than we had at the end of 2000. You can't and don't grow a retail business unless you grow store base. Our reluctance to grow store base has been based on really three things. One is a model that we were comfortable with that we could roll with that would get return on capital. Two is some systems capability to ensure that if we did accelerate openings we can effectively handle it. And three is understanding the store format and size that we think gives the highest returns and gives us the most amount of flexibility for stocking the SKUs we think customers want to buy, which leads us to the confidence we now have about our retail portfolio called Millennium. Millennium is our new store format. Our latest version of that is called M2. It now incorporates all of the customer and operational feedback from our earlier tests. It's more open, it has it adjacencies that customers like, its shopability by all the customer measurements is significantly higher, it has an improved operational design and too is less CapEx to build or remodel than other models we have tested. It requires less selling square feet. We are now confident that we can take an average Depot store, roughly about a 6 or $7 million store because on average that what that's what our stores do, and we can operate that store effectively today out of 17,500 square feet versus the average 27,000 square feet we have in the chain, so a substantial reduction of square feet. That means lower real estate costs, lower occupancy costs, lower operating costs and lower payroll costs. We confident this model will work. We ran (ph) two things. The M2 remodel we are confident has substantially or will substantially reduce in-store replenishment costs. The big costs in stores is the replenishment -- get units in the back room where it was delivered onto the shelf so the customer can see it. We have some significantly redesigns in M2 which we will unveil, if you will, for the first time at the end of June that will, we believe, take significant labor costs out of the North American stores. And we have done some things with signage which we think will drive customers (indiscernible) store. You say, that doesn't sound very important. Let me give you a statistic. Almost 60 percent of the customers who shop at an Office Depot superstore, and we believe our competitors, have to ask where the merchandise is. They can't easily find it. If you think about that in the aggregate, that's an awful lot of time and store hours that are not helping the customer other than to find their way to a section. We believe we have a store design that is intuitive and that will make it more clear and easy for customers to shop and understand the store. The store design itself is significantly different than any superstore here in North America, and this will be the model of store we use to open all of our new stores going forward. We now expected to open between 70 and 80 new stores in the second half of this year with this model. And we're remodeling North America at 50 or 60 of those stores in the second half of this year as well. 4 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Bernstein & Co. 20th Annual Strategic Decisions Conference 2004 One other questions that always come up is well that's a lot of capital and are you going to get a return; and are you just going to put a lot of capital to try and save (ph) comps without understanding its return on capital. We've looked at an M2 remodel program and we look at store volume and investment, and we've calculated the lift on average, the incremental lift it will take to get -- earn our cost of capital that back. So if you look at the highlighted box, we now believe that on average we can remodel a store in North America for about $250,000. That on average is about $150,000 less than our M1 format. We think that remodel substantially then changes the store to the design we have conceptualized and talked about. And to get return on that we basically have to get between a 2 and a 2.5 or 3 percent lift. We're confident we can do that to earn back our cost of capital. We will look at investing by store, by store volume, and by how much capital -- some stores by definition will take more than 250. We also think there's an awful lot of stores in Office Depot that will take far less than 250, but the focus here in we're confident we can earn back the cost of capital by reinvesting in this portfolio. Finally, the last piece of this is to use our Toys-R-Us acquisition of sites to enter the Northeast. This is the least saturated office superstore market in the US. By any way you calculate saturation, it's the least saturated market. It contains roughly one-third of the GDP of the United States. If you take from Baltimore north to Massachusetts and not quite to Detroit, it's almost a third of the US GDP. It's an area where Office Depot stores are under penetrated. It has the highest concentration of business customers than in any other geography, and we believe we have a new store format called M2 that's highly differentiated in store layout, design and costs, and that we now are confident we can use this new store design to enter the rich northeastern markets. Now, I know that makes investors nervous. Number one, it brings the question is there going to be a competitive war. I should remind all of you that for the past five or six years our two primary office superstore competitors have significantly entered Office Depot territory. So if you go back to the origin of the superstore (ph) chain, I said Texas, California and Florida are the strongholds of Office Depot. For the past three or four years we have faced significant entry of new competitors into those markets where we were, and continue to be in some cases, dominant. So this has been going on in the industry for years. The difference is we're going into the least saturated, highest density, one of the highest cost markets to do business, but we're doing that with a differentiated store format, with a lower operating cost model, and one we're confident can return to the shareholder value and accelerate our growth in retail. One other fact that's interesting is where there is an Office Depot store, every other part of our business performs better -- our contact business performs better, our delivery business or catalogs performs better, our e-commerce business is better, our loyalty is better, our retention is higher, and our cost to acquire new customers is less. And therefore, it's an important part of our strategy that we have worked on for well over three years and now feel confident that we can roll (ph). So over the next six months we will take the Kids-R-Us sites (indiscernible) we acquired 124 Kids-R-Us sites, of which we felt we could use 50 or 60 of those for Office Depot sites. Of those 50 or 60, about 30 of those, 30 or 35 of those, are here in the Northeast. That will become the basis of our entry into three significant markets in the Northeast. The rest of the stores or the Kids-R-Us sites will convert to Office Depot stores predominantly already in existing territories and the rest of the real estate portfolio we will offload to somebody else. We have sold 20 of those sites to Petsmart -- Petco -- forgive me, I get them mixed up -- Petco and we're in the process of contacting other retailers for the remainder of those sites. What does all this mean? We're going to restore growth to our retail base. At the end of 2000 we had 888 (ph) stores in North America. We're going to add in the neighborhood of 80 to 100 stores per year for the next three years. A substantial number of those will be here in the Northeast but we will also fill in the markets in which we have already a very strong presence. A good example of that is South Florida. In three counties in South Florida we have about 33 or 34 stores. We are the dominant player. We are in the process of increasing that store count by 50 percent. We are about half way there, and so a good number of these stores go into the heart of an area where we have high branded image, high brand identity, and strong operating performance, and continue to add retail capacity, and that capacity does extremely well. Let me change now to customer profitability, and first I want to talk about again identifying retail customers and how important it is to manage customer profitability across all channels and brands. First, let's talk about retail and I will go into some depth in this. Four things we've done. We've redeployed our North American sales force. Last fall and the early part of this year we took some 1300 reps here in North America, basically focused their efforts on those reps that are good to acquire accounts and those reps that are better at penetrating accounts. We aligned our sales management and our sales force. We're beginning to see the early signs that that will accelerate new account acquisition in our contract business. We have not had difficulty retaining accounts. We have 5 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Bernstein & Co. 20th Annual Strategic Decisions Conference 2004 had some challenge in growing the revenue of our existing accounts through the economic cycle we have been in. That too looks like it's changing. But with the redeployment of our sales force we are confident we will accelerate new account acquisition in the medium and large accounts here in North America. We have ramped up substantially a program called TAM, telephone account management. Now we're taking smaller and medium-sized accounts instead of calling on them with a human being outside sales reps we call on them from the inside. It is more cost efficient. We better coordinate the contact points between catalog and contract. We are also seeing some significant growth in those accounts in territories we have converted to TAM, and we are rolling that program out. I am going to talk about the Advantage program in a second, and marketing spend (ph) is key elements of this. Let me talk about Advantage. We launched a customer identity program in February called Advantage. We have now 1.5 million customers. Advantage customers buy two to three times more. It improves our ability to focus. It's self funding. It differentiates and when we know a retail customer -- up until Advantage we've only known about 20 percent of our retail customers. It allows us to know more of our customers, better target market to them, direct advertising spend to them in a more meaningful way, and understand their profitability, the retail customer profitability, across all channels. We're optimizing marketing spend. We're looking at the right mix, as you always have to do. Chuck Rubin not only is our chief merchant but he is also our chief marketing officer. And he has adopted the age-old phrase which you heard many times, "only half of our marketing money is spent effectively. The problem is we don't always know which half it is." There are some sophisticated tools today in place that are helping us understand that half, and Advantage will help us focus our direct marketing efforts to those accounts that we know when they buy, how often they buy, how frequently they buy and what they buy, and that leads to better retention, better response rates and more baskets. As part of one-to-one marketing we use our data marketing skills that we have from the legacy of Viking to do this effectively. Our Magellan merchandising system, some of you heard about this. It's the largest single digit (ph) system program we have ever undertaken at Office Depot. It's a 32 month project, 31 month project. Here's the top line. We are about halfway through; not quite. It is on time, it is on budget delivering the benefits as planned. Four key areas -- store and space planning, merchandise and discrete assortment, merchandise planning, and replenishment and forecasting. Let me speak a little bit to each one of those. Store and space planning, that module is in and operating. We simply could not add hundreds of new stores and remodel hundreds of stores without a more effective space planning tool. That piece (indiscernible) Magellan has been delivered on time, on budget and is performing well. Magellan better aligns our merchandising system capabilities with our strategy. You need capability to go with strategy. It enables processes, tools and technology. Four planned outcomes -- improve sales and margin through a more effective store utilization called space planning, stronger assortment of merchandise plans, discrete assortments. We've been a chain that what is good for 1 store is good for 900. Magellan gives us the capability to discrete assort by store through some sophisticated tools. Better pricing, better decision-making and data, and improving stock. And here's some of the highlights of the benefits. We think it's a 1.5 to 2.5 percent sales lift. That means 100 to $150 million of incremental sales when Magellan is fully implemented in about 15 months from now. We think it's a 35 to 65 margin basis point improvement. That too is incremental. That is 20 to $30 million of incremental gross margin. We think we can improve our already industry-leading supply chain; seven to an eight percent improvement in inventory turns. That means 60 to $75 million reduction one time in inventory. Our project is complex, but to date is on time, on budget, delivering the benefits as they have been scaled to deliver. And finally, our supply chain, just a brief comment about our supply chain. As I said, it's industry-leading. We have the highest inventory turns in our industry, and frankly have had that for some time. We intend to continue to grow that leading supply chain, and we do it in differentiated way. We're the only superstore retailer in North America that uses a combination of large warehouses which fulfill customer orders and cross docks (ph), North American cross docks which replenish stores. We basically go to every one of our stores every day from a cross dock. That means a couple of things. We replenish more frequently which means higher inventory turns, our in stock position is better, and it answers one of the concerns people have when you invest more in technology. The fact is we can feel comfortable about managing the lifecycle of technology products of desktops and laptops by utilizing our best in class supply chain and manage their lifecycle by deliver every day. Other office supply superstores don't have that capability that allows you to manage that inventory as well as we do. We intend to expand on that lead. 6 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Bernstein & Co. 20th Annual Strategic Decisions Conference 2004 Private-label. Private-label today is about 12 percent of our business. Worldwide directionally we're headed to 25. It's an enormous opportunity for lots of different reasons. Yesterday we announced a significant redesign of the packaging of our private-label paper. The reason paper is so important is it is a big part of our category -- it is 15 to 20 percent of our revenue -- it occupies a significant part of the space of our retail store and it is enormously confusing to buy. The reality is what we want to do is to drive the paper to the customer requirement. What's the customer requirement? So we package and we identify features, benefits and attributes, and we drive the customer to the product they need, and often that is the product that has higher margins and higher value than commodity kind of paper. There's an enormous opportunity at Office Depot to add value to private-label, and as I said directionally it is our goal in the next couple of years to double our penetration. What does that mean? It means improved margins, it means improved buying and leverage, and it's a better value to the customer. That's been in conjunction with a concept we call global content management. We've invested significant amount of effort in this over the past two or three years. This means that we can describe a product one time -- attributes, benefits and futures -- put it in a sophisticated database, and deliver that information to the point-of-sale -- signs in retail stores that drive the customer to the right product they want at the right time. How do you explain the difference between 20 and 24 and 26 pound paper (indiscernible)? We can do it in in-store signage. We can do it over the Internet, we can do it through catalogs, and we can do it through e-commerce. So global content management gives features, benefits and attributes that the customer cares about most, describes the product that way which we think helps the customer make decision about products. The net return is we get more of their wallet and we get higher margins. Developed proprietary brands. Christopher Lowell, some of you may or may not be familiar with his name, but this is a private brand expansion to an otherwise destination category that was highly fragmented. This is exclusive to Office Depot. It's features and benefits were designed by us and Christopher Lowell to hit both price and value points and quality that were not addressed within our industry. It has higher gross margins than average and its sales are well ahead of plan. We think there are opportunities beyond this category to do the same thing, and this, as I said, is exclusive to Office Depot. You simply can't buy it anyplace else. Let me talk a little bit about our international group for a minute. One of the things you heard me talk about, Excel in Europe. We are the leader in Europe by a significant factor. If you look on your left, you see our pro forma versus our four major competitors. Basically we're twice their size. Size counts, size matters, leverage counts. This is an enormously profitable business and has huge opportunity to grow, and we intend to grow and continue our European market leadership. Here's a little bit of what our international business looks like as a part of our revenue. About 45 percent of it is contract international, about 49 percent of it is mail-order, and as you can see only 6 percent is retail. Retail is not our primary strategy outside the United States. Delivery is, and this takes the two elements -- mail-order which is basically the legacy of the Viking acquisition of 1998 and enormously profitable, cash flow, high return on investment, growing business, although it's smaller growth rates, and our contract business, which we entered both a startup starting in 2001 and then in the acquisition of Guilbert last year gave us the lead in Europe and we intend to expand and grow that lead. This group is enormously profitable. It is high sales growth in local currencies. It is high profit growth in local currencies. It does have the currency risk with it to translate results outside the United States to US currency. Today that's benefiting us slightly if you look of the value of the euro to the dollar. But this is an enormous business. This is an important part of our business segment that is incredibly profitable, generates high return on capital and high amounts of free cash flow, and we intend to continue and invest and grow this business. We need to accelerate and will accelerate the Guilbert growth. We bought Guilbert a year ago, doubled our size. Our challenging work today is growing that piece of our business. Guilbert had not grown on a top line for the past three years. We need return a culture of growth through some sophisticated tools. We're confident we will do that. Our catalog businesses in Europe are doing fine; a little softness in Germany, a little softness in France, but they're doing fine. And we're going to focus on our retail profitability in the three countries outside the United States where we have 100 percent owned (indiscernible) -- France, Spain, and Japan. And we will continue to acquire or build our presence in new countries. An example of that is a couple weeks ago we announced the acquisition of our franchisee in Hungary. it is not a lot of capital. He gives us access to 10 new European countries with a very strong management team and a presence and a business that's already profitable, albeit small, that fits into our culture extremely well that gives us more opportunities to grow that business in the future. And we've been outside the United States since 1990 so we know how to run and manage this business. 7 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Bernstein & Co. 20th Annual Strategic Decisions Conference 2004 Let me talk about in summary what all this means. A balanced portfolio, three basic businesses, seven key strategies driving our business, and we are confident that these initiatives will deliver value. Let me give you some examples. By improving our international retail business three countries - Japan, Spain, and France -- when we get those to EBIT brake even that would result in six to seven percent share accretion. Put another way, our start-ups in those three business is jointly (ph) costing the company six, seven cents a share. We are on our way to profitability in France with comps this past quarter of plus 18 percent, our Japan operations are basically today at break even prior to G&A costs, and our Spain operation -- five (ph) retail stores -- are now progressing nicely. We believe within the next 24 months we will get those to at least EBIT brake even. That's six or seven percent of share. Doubling our private-label penetration from 2003 levels could add another four to five cents per share -- higher margins, higher values, better perceived value for the customer. And returning our North American retail stores to the profitable probability level they had in 2002 -- that's two years ago -- would add 15 to 20 cents per share of earnings. We are confident we have a store model that will help us do that. We are confident with our global sourcing, leveraging our private-label, focus on payroll costs, focus on CapEx that we can and will return our retail business in North America to 2002 profitability level (ph). And the point of all that is we have an enormous room to grow. Talked about strategies for a moment; let me talk (indiscernible) about high level 2004 and take you from the strategic to the tactical and just reaffirm what we think this year is going to be like. We believe we will have quarterly sequential improvement in North American comps. We view the first quarter plus three percent. We think our overall sales growth in North American retail this year will be six to eight percent. It will be the first year we have had retail sales growth in almost four years. And our gross margins compared to 2003, excluding the mix of technology, will be slightly higher. We're seeing margin improvement across our retail businesses in all categories except technology, and technology is a higher percent of our mix and that would cause the consolidated margin mix to look lower. Our North American business services group, we see sales from the mid to the high single digits as the quarters and the year continues; slightly lower gross margins predominately because of the mix to larger customers, the fastest-growing segment of our North American delivery business; and a continued decline in North American warehouse costs. To remind you (indiscernible) North American warehouse costs, over the past three years we've probably invested about $75 million roughly in North American warehouses. That investment, a capital investment, plus other focus has taken out $150 million of cost in our North American warehouses over the past three years, and there's still more opportunity to do that, and we continue to see that in the first quarter throughout this year. Our international group sales growth in local currencies in low to single mid digits, that may be at short-term risk with the impact of Guilbert and our struggle to grow that in two countries at the moment, France and the UK. Although I will add we are not losing share in either of those countries. We have a large position in those countries. We have a Guilbert organization not used to growth. We are confident we can restore it to growth. Stable gross margins, except the impact of Guilbert in the mix. And we have and will continue to achieve (indiscernible) synergies. Our CapEx for the year -- 3 to 350, excluding the impact of the toy stores. We offered to pay $197 million for those sites. We now think by the time we get done with that, not taking some of the sites as planned, off-loading some of the sites, that that will be more like 125 million when we're done with that. At this stage, by the way, we've only been able to close on 10 stores. Kids and Toys are slow delivering us the closings, and we don't pay for those until we close them. So we've got about 10 closed. And we think free cash flow, ex out the Kids will be up 4 to $450 million. And we remain comfortable with the EPS guidance this year of $1.20 to $1.25. So that kind of sums up first an awful lot about the three or four things we're spending most of our time on that we drive value and then a little of insight into the current year. Hope that's given you a feel an a flavor for Office Depot. And Colin at this time we will open it up to questions. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Retail Hardlines Analyst If you could please pass your cards to the assistant walking through the aisle. 8 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Bernstein & Co. 20th Annual Strategic Decisions Conference 2004 First, why don't we start with one just on the overall environment. If you can comment on what you're seeing in terms of business demand, trends in office products demand; what your outlook is for the economy or the trends going forward as well? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman & CEO I think from our perspective there are signs that the overall environment is positive. A couple things that we look at -- spending in technology. Remember, technology spending for a small business is a PC, a laptop, a new all-in-one printer, a new laser printer. These are not huge CapEx items; these are 3, 400, $900 each. That's increasing the across the board. We think that's a good sign. Small businesses have under-invested in those categories in the past three years, and they want to shop those at Office Depot. Our average order value in both retail, commercial and our contract businesses is creeping upwards. That means customers are buying more on an average transaction. That's always been an indication of confidence. The average number of items on an order is increasing slightly. That too has been always a leading indicator about customer confidence. And overall spending is up, so we're pretty confident we do have, at least at the moment, an environment in which there is growth in spending. The worry we all have is the political environment as all that (ph) means to it, and certainly the issues outside the United States. But basically all the signs we see tell us that we've got an improved environment for spending at the retail level and at the large account level. Our large account business is growing nicely -- that's corporate America. They are starting to add some payroll in the aggregate and we're winning some share. So we are optimistic (indiscernible). Our forecast for the outlook is basically business is the same. We don't see it -- it doesn't have to get better for us to perform better. If it got worse that would be another issue, but we think that is going to hold throughout this year. Europe, a little different. I think Europe's economy is not as in good shape as the US, particularly in the large countries. France, Germany in particular are struggling for growth; high unemployment, you all know about it. France and Germany represent a significant part of our present (ph). I don't think we're getting economic tail wind in Europe at the moment. In fact, I would say we have economic head wind today in some bigger countries in Europe. Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Retail Hardlines Analyst Question here on the longer-term operating margins. First, what is the North American retail margin difference between Office Depot and Staples today apples-to-apples, I guess asking about G&A (ph) allocation? And what is the long-term consolidated operating margin targets? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman & CEO Let me go to the first one. Apples-to-apples as we talk about before allocation it would appear that Staples' retail business is probably in the neighborhood of directionally 150 to 200 basis points more profitable than our North American business. I think that's a function of a couple of things, not the least of which is their presence in Canada which is 220 some odd stores (indiscernible). I happen to believe that that's an enormously profitable segment of Staples' business. I also would add that I think where we compete side-by-side given a Staples in three to five miles there is no evidence that we're less profitable, nor is there any evidence that we lose share. So I think part of it is a real estate portfolio, and that's why I'm really confident about our ability to raise our store operating margins to 2002 levels. The second question, Colin, was what? Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Retail Hardlines Analyst Consolidated operating margin target long-term. 9 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Bernstein & Co. 20th Annual Strategic Decisions Conference 2004 Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman & CEO As you talk about operating margins, certainly five to six percent consolidated. I don't think it gets much higher than that. I don't think the competitive environment lets you get much higher. I think that creates umbrellas (ph). Certainly five to six percent operating margins is an attainable target and not that much of a stretch for us. Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Retail Hardlines Analyst A question here on comps and leverage. Within the North American retail division when do you begin to see leverage from delivering positive comps given that you didn't see that in Q1, and does it require greater than a three percent comp to leverage SG&A (inaudible)? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman & CEO I think -- and this is just an insight into Q1 for a minute -- the lack of leverage in Q1 was intentional. If that makes you nervous I'm sorry, but we increased our advertising spend in Q1 deliberately for a variety of reasons, and I won't go into all of them. And two, as we have said all along, an early ramp up of comps would come with technology. That with the confidence we have of (indiscernible) technology and now with the addition of Chuck that our early in 2004 comps would ramp up quickly in technology (indiscernible). Technology contributes less to the bottom line; it is probable, it's just less profitable. So I think we will start to see leverage in comps, particularly in the second half of the year, as our supply comps increase. And one of the initiatives we have that is more short-terms is in the next eight weeks we will reset almost two-thirds of our stores in the middle of the period -- the technology section of the store. That's not a reallocation of space to technology; that's putting adjacencies, supply adjacencies, computer supply adjacencies near the hardware. And we believe that will drive higher basket, higher margins, higher growth, and we've got some evidence on the test data to point that out. We will have those resets done in two-thirds of the chain by the second week of July. The third of the chain we're not resetting are the stories we have designated for remodels in the next 12 to 18 months. So we're confident that as we get to the second half our comps will ramp, they will be supply driven and there will be leverage on the cost base, and therefore deliver incremental EPS. Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Retail Hardlines Analyst Speaking of remodeling, can you discuss the M2 rollout in stores per year and the corresponding CapEx and free cash flow for '04 to '06? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman & CEO You can do the cash, if you would Charlie. The roll out -- I said earlier we will open about 80 to 100 stores. The variability will be the Kids sites that gets delivered to us in the second half of this year, and virtually all of those will be M2. And our current plans are to remodel 50 to 60 existing stores to M2, and we will hopefully have all of those done before the holiday season, some before back-to-school. Assuming that the M2 model generates what we think it will, then we would accelerate remodeling of our existing chain in 2005 and beyond into the 100 per year as opposed to less than 100 per year. And if we get the kind of return that we would like, we will accelerate those as fast as our capabilities will let us. On the free cash flow, I will give that question to Charlie and let him expound. Charlie Brown - Office Depot - EVP & CFO Our current guidance on free cash flow for the year is 400 to 450 million. That obviously doesn't include a significant acceleration in the remodels. At a 200, $250,000 remodel to so 100 a year you would have to knock about a couple hundred million off of that number as we accelerate that 10 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Bernstein & Co. 20th Annual Strategic Decisions Conference 2004 program. There probably also would be a slight dip for the acceleration of openings, but as we start to lap that the cash will come back. So through '06 you are probably looking at with an accelerated remodel program free cash flow in the, I want to say 300 million to 350 range. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman & CEO And that's with accelerated remodels and accelerated new openings. Charlie Brown - Office Depot - EVP & CFO Certainly better than 250. Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Retail Hardlines Analyst There was a nice follow-up question here, if I can find it. You talk a lot about free cash flow. What's the view on allocation of that free cash flow in view on dividend? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman & CEO The most frequently asked question on the face of the earth. I said (indiscernible) We are driven to increase return on capital. You can't sit with a lot of cash and do that. We have continued to discuss ways to give back shareholder value, and we will continue to discuss. Our commitment to this is to deliver value to you one way or another, either grow the value by reinvesting the business as we did with Guilbert and/or give that cash back to you directly in the form of either dividends or stock repurchase. That's our fundamental perspective of how we run that business. We've done that in the four years I've been here and we will continue to do that. So I think you will continue to see us drive our cash per shareholder value. Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Retail Hardlines Analyst Time for one last question here. There's obviously been a lot of organizational changes over the course of the last 12 months. Can you just comment generally on how the organization is settling in, and then any update on the search for a President, North American position? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot - Chairman & CEO I think this is probably one of the most talked about events at Office Depot, and I can understand your concern and nervousness. From my chair, I think if you ask my two colleagues here, one of which is new, they would say to you that the changes we've made in the last 12 months have been enormously positive. I'm confident we have an executive team that is working more in harmony with each other in a more coordinated fashion than ever before, and delivering (indiscernible) better than before. In spite of what (indiscernible) it is not unstable inside the company. In fact it's quite stable. On the search for a North American President, that's not a position that's been open for use, so it's not something that has to be filled. Unlike some other positions that we had where we had to find somebody, a la marketing with Chuck and merchandising because both are now his responsibility, I continue the search for that position. It is to add bench strength. It's a new position at Office Depot. I'm optimistic we can find the right person. The search continues. It's not an easy search for a lot of reasons. It's a complex business model. And we've got a team of people that the individual has to be still a part of as opposed to change the team. So I'm confident about leadership today and our stability, and I'm not nearly as nervous about it as some of you who write about it and try to understand it from the outside. I could go into lots of detail about it, but it wouldn't serve any useful purpose.

JULY 28, 2004 / 7:00PM, - Q2 2004 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO Thank you, John. These stacked bars compare earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2003 with those of the first half of 2004. This year's second-quarter EPS of 71 cents was 27 percent above the 56 cents we reported in the second quarter of 2003. Comparing both halves, we've earned $1.35 this year versus 99 cents in the first half of 2003. In the second quarter, earnings continue to reflect some of the trends we first observed last quarter. Transportation results continue to be strong, above the targets we've set for the unit. Real estate results are considerably above target, and they came in much earlier in the year than we had projected. As we said in the release, those earlier closings will lower our expectations for the next two quarters. Lastly, although food products is much smaller than the two I just mentioned, the negative financial effects of the shortfall of this year's sugar production did begin to show up in the second quarter's results. This slide shows the composition of operating profit among the five businesses for the second quarters of '03 and 2004. Moving from the bottom of the blocks to the top in 2004, Matson provided more than half of the quarter's operating profit, 55 percent. Logistics services' contribution continues to grow nicely, now 5 percent. Property leasing was 16 percent. Property sales with very strong performance was 24 percent, and food products dropped to 1 percent. I'm now going to take each business segment and talk about its performance in the quarter and then its outlook. Ocean transportation operating profit rose 35 percent to $31 million. This improvement was based upon a 4 percent increase in revenue and total expenses that were virtually identical to the second quarter of last year. These charts show the primary volume metrics for the Hawaii service. On the left is quarterly total container volume in thousands of units; on the right is autos. Within this quarter, its 1 percent increase in total container volume was a 4 percent increase in Hawaii-bound cargo. This was driven by better overall economic conditions in the state and strong construction in particular. Autos were flat overall but volume continues to be at historically high levels. These charts show two Hawaii service metrics that describe the revenue yield on cargo. The yield per Hawaii-bound container rose a total 6 percent. This increase comes from an overall level of freight rates, the terminal handling charge, the fuel surcharge and changes in mix of commodities carried. On mix, for example, refrigerated containers bring in more revenue per unit than do most dry containers. The yield for Hawaii-bound auto rose of total of about 3 percent. The fuel surcharge is intended as a direct cost offset -- well, the other revenue increases are utilized to offset wholly or in part increases in the other operating costs. This chart of operating profit margin is intended to capture information about all categories of cost. In the past, we've said that Matson's operating margins usually are in the range of 10 to 12 percent. So you can see, reaching 15 percent this quarter represents unusually good performance. In fact, this is the best second-quarter margin in recent years. Among the year-over-year positives in expense categories this quarter were the absence of a one-time excise tax provision last year, lower benefits and G&A costs. One factor contributing to the lower cost was Matson's recent relocation of its headquarters from San Francisco to Oakland. Partially offsetting were higher cargo-handling costs, insurance costs and vessel depreciation. Of special note is fuel. We expensed fuel at nearly $30 a barrel this quarter versus $26.35 in the second quarter of 2003. With a fuel surcharge of 8 percent for most of the quarter, the added revenue kept pace with our increased fuel costs. To help us look ahead to the second half of the year, here is a chart of the operating profit in millions of dollars, by quarter. At this point, with Hawaii's economy still looking strong, cargo demand looks good. We don't expect to take any additional rate increases this year and contractual longshore cost increases take place at mid-year, so these costs will be rising. 3 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

JULY 28, 2004 / 7:00PM, - Q2 2004 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Taking all these factors together, we expect that Matson will continue to have good performance in the balance of the year, but its profit margins may not be as high as they were this quarter. There are several other issues at Matson worthy of mention. We expect to take delivery of the second new vessel in Matson's fleet in August. The Maunawili follows the Manukai into service by less than a year. Also in early July, Matson switched container terminals in Oakland to a new facility dedicated just to its use. As you know, we have had a vessel charter and operating alliance APL for our service to Guam. This agreement expires in February of 2006 and we now expect that it will not be renewed. As we described in our 10-Q filed today, Matson currently estimates that the annual operating profit reduction can be estimated at 10 to $20 million and possibly higher during the transition period following the agreement's expiration. With 18 months until that expiration, Matson is focused on developing an optimal successor service to Guam. We plan to keep you apprised of our progress on developing that successor service. After the end of the quarter, we learned that one of our partners in Sea star, a joint venture service at Puerto Rico, plans to exercise its option to purchase Matson's 19.5 percent interest during the third quarter. This purchase will generate a small gain and will relieve us of a guarantee of $11 million of venture debt. I would note that the guarantee was once $31 million. Another company is constructing a car carrier service to Hawaii -- car carrier for service to Hawaii. The (indiscernible) reports that this vessel will be completed in the first half of 2005. Matson takes this potential competitive entry seriously and is working to provide the best competitive service to retain its current auto-shipping customers. Lastly, the Carlyle Group, owner of our competitor in the Hawaii service called Horizon Lines, announced that it had sold that business to another private equity firm. Castle Harlan. We do not anticipate any negative effects on the Hawaii trade as a result of this change. Moving onto the logistics service component of the transportation segment, Matson Integrated Logistics had great performance. Operating profits rose a strong 86 percent on a 63 percent increase in revenue. This chart shows two of these operating metrics for Matson Integrated Logistics. On the left is the quarterly increase in total revenue; this is a proxy for overall level of activity in that unit. The improvements result both from an acquisition near the year end of 2003 and overall internal growth. On the right, you can see profit margin, which also shows good performance this quarter. Our expectation is that, with strong management, the contribution from logistics services will continue to grow from its relatively small dollar base. As the U.S. economy continues to pick up and shipping traffic rose commensurately, we expect good year-over-year comparisons will continue. Now, turning to food products, revenue in this quarter was off 18 percent. Operating profit declined 87 percent. This performance was primarily attributable to the expected lower sugar production for the year. This metric is easier to see in the stacked-bar format. Year-to-date sugar production at HC&S is off by 23,000 tons or 26 percent. This decline resulted from a combination of heavy rains, resulting in difficult factory conditions and malicious fires that have disrupted harvesting. In spite of solid cost controls, a production shortfall of this magnitude is just too great to make up, so our unit costs have been revised to match the expected annual production. For the rest of the year, it appears that domestic sugar prices will be below our targets for the year. We now estimate that raw sugar production will be 5 to 7 percent below 2003 levels. Although operating costs will be lower than in 2003 for the full year, we expect that the segment will be marginally profitable. Moving now to real estate results, property leasing had a 1 percent decline in revenue and a 2 percent decrease in operating profit in the quarter. Looking at occupancy metrics that we have provided before, there will be -- there was a small year-over-year decrease in the quarterly rate for mainland occupancy, and Hawaii occupancies were flat. 4 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

JULY 28, 2004 / 7:00PM, - Q2 2004 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Another cause for the decrease in operating profit were expenses relating to the repair of siding of an office building here in Honolulu. This chart shows quarterly operating profit for last year and year-to-date, 2004. For the balance of the year, we expect that the entire portfolio will enjoy continued good occupancy levels and that lease rates will be stable. As a result, operating profit from the leased portfolio will likely have modest growth for the second half. In the second quarter, we had $28 million of revenue in property sales, an increase of 7 percent. Operating profit from property sales rose 94 percent, however, to $13.4 million based upon higher-margin mix of sales. For this business, the best way to describe performance is on the basis of individual projects. This is an aerial of Wailea. During the quarter, Wailea was the dominant contributor. Recall that we'd purchased 270 acres of that Maui resort late last year, consisting of 17 development parcels plus 29 home lots. About $18 million of the 28 million in revenue this quarter was from Wailea. Filled in in red, as you see on this slide, we sold two development parcels, a total of 19.8 acres outright and one parcel, 30 acres, on an installment basis in the quarter. In addition, we closed five houselots at Gulf Vistas, our residential subdivision. We also plan to announce shortly a joint venture to develop another parcel with a partner. We started with 29 Gulf Vista houselots. They average roughly a third of an acre in size, 21 closed in the first quarter, 5 in the second. Prices have averaged $860,000. At the end of the quarter, there were three lots remaining. Back on Oahu, Mill Town Center, our industrial subdivision, had 11 parcel sales in the quarter. Those 27-acre projects started a few years ago had a total of 61 lots. It is now very close to selling out. In fact, Mill Town Center was the very first of our Hawaii acquisitions we call Project X, investing in lands outside our core land holdings. We've done twenty of these investments to date in the last five-plus years. Selling prices to date at Mill Town have been in the high $20 per square foot. At the end of the quarter, the remaining nine lots had active interest. Our office condominium in downtown Honolulu has one floor closing in the second quarter. Prices have averaged $1.1 million per floor. Since the end of the quarter, two floors have closed escrow. We have active and very active interest in all the remaining floors, even though the they are in loft or unfinished condition. In effect, with the closings that we've had through the first half of the year, we've gotten about $18 million back before taxes. We (indiscernible) on the sales for a little more than half of the property. Lanikea at Waikiki -- although the next few projects did not contribute to revenue or profit in this quarter, I think it's good to go over them. Lanikea, our oceanview Waikiki condo construction is going well, 100 units except one penthouse under binding contracts, prices average 588,000 per unit. Hokua, our luxury high-rise construction, is also progressing well. We expect work there to finish late in 2005. All but 7 of the 247 units are under binding contract averaging $1 million per unit. Mauna Lani Resort, you're hearing this one for the first time. We did have a release on this joint venture in the quarter. During the quarter, we announced a new joint venture at the Mauna Lani Resort on the Kona coast. There, we've partnered with Brookfield on a 30-acre site adjacent to a championship golf course. This is one of and in fact our first large effort on the big Island and we have a top-notch partner. Our final plans for this project are likely to offer a mix of single-family and multi-family homes as well as luxury houselots. We expect construction to begin about mid-year, 2005. Property sales -- this chart shows just how strong our operating profit has been so for this year. The fact is the pace of property sales and pricing both have exceeded our expectations. As we look to the rest of year, given the pace of those earlier transactions, the mix of inventory that we have on hand and the time it takes to conclude these sales, it's clear that the pace of sales for the balance of this year will be much slower. If you recall and as you can see in this table on the slide, we have also had faster and earlier sales last year with the second half having considerably fewer sales. Kukui'Ula -- we've partnered with D&B Associates on the development of a high-end MasterPlan resort community of (indiscernible) in the southern coast of Kauai called Kukui'Ula. The project will comprise 1200 to 1500 residential units, commercial areas and also an 18-hole championship golf course and other amenities. A major milestone was achieved on July 22 when the Kauai County Council gave final zoning approval for that project. When signed by the mayor of Kauai, this project will proceed with final design and construction.

JULY 28, 2004 / 7:00PM, - Q2 2004 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call A&B has the option to invest in future equity requirements for the project, which we will be evaluating very seriously over the next few months. Construction is expected to begin in 2005 with the first sale slated to occur in 2006. Within the next 6 to 12 months, we will provide a detailed development plan for the project in an earnings call. This is a very significant matter for the Company. So, at this point, I'm going to turn it over to Chris Benjamin to make some comments on our financial position. Chris Benjamin - Alexander & Baldwin - CFO Thanks, Allen, and good afternoon to everybody listening in on the mainland. I'm going to start with some general comments before I move to the financial statement. First of all, we have adjusted our 2004 effective tax rate estimate to 38 percent compared with the 37.5 percent I mentioned at the end of the first quarter. This increase simply reflects our latest estimates of earnings and tax credits for the year. We repurchased 76,000 shares of stock in May at 29.95 a share; the total cost was $2.3 million. In December 2002, management was granted the authority to repurchase up to 2 million shares by our Board of Directors. This authority expires at the end of 2004, and following this most recent repurchase, it now stands at 1.9 million shares. These are the first repurchases that we've undertaken since 2001, when we bought 105,000 shares at an average of $21.61. In 1999 and 2000, we bought a combined 3.9 million shares at an average of $21.07 a share. Regarding new vessel financing, Allen mentioned the MV Maunawili a moment ago. Most of my comments today are going to focus on the financial statement implications of the financing of that vessel, as well as the subsequent retirement of Matson's commercial paper program. The financing of the vessel itself is relatively straightforward. The cost of the ship is $101 million and Matson plans to withdraw $46 million from the capital construction fund to finance the purchase. The balance of $55 million will be financed through Title 11 guaranteed debt. The Title 11 debt will have an all-in interest rate of 6.6 percent and a 25-year final maturity. On the commercial paper program, Matson's intent is to retire this commercial paper program following the purchase of the MV Maunawili. As you may recall, Matson has a $100 million of commercial paper outstanding and a corresponding $100 million in its capital construction fund, or CCF. This program has earned generous spreads between CCF returns and the interest on the commercial paper a total of over $21 million over the past 12 years. But due to declining spreads, Matson has decided to take advantage of the purchase of the Maunawili to end this program and will withdraw $100 million from the CCF to do so. The reason that the retirement of the commercial paper program is timed to take place after the delivery of the Maunawili is that Matson needs sufficient tax bases in its vessels to minimize the immediate tax impact of the withdrawal. How it works is that rather than making a $100 million taxable withdrawal from CCF, Matson will reduce its tax bases in its vessels by that same amount and make the withdrawal itself non-taxable. By reducing the tax basis of the vessels, of course Matson's tax depreciation in 2004 and subsequent years will be reduced. The impact in 2004 will be about $11 million of deferred taxes becoming payable later in the year. We would expect that payment to be made in December. So, on the next slide, to summarize the impact of these two events, the Maunawili purchase and commercial paper retirement, will have on the balance sheet, there are two things really. The first is that the recent decision to retire the commercial paper program triggers the reclassification of both the CCF and commercial paper balances to current assets and liabilities respectively. That's the only effect you will see for the second quarter. Later in the year, however, the commercial paper and CCF balances will decline as shown in this table to 0 and $20 million respectively, with Title 11 debt increasing to $109 million. 6 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

JULY 28, 2004 / 7:00PM, - Q2 2004 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call So, with that background, the balance sheet explanation is relatively straightforward. Current assets increased to $385 million at quarter-end, primarily as a result of the reclassification of the CCF assets to current and also due to an increase in sugar inventory and in cash of about $15 million each. Investments have increased $31 million. That's primarily as a result of the investments in construction at Hokua and investments in two other real estate-related joint ventures. The noncurrent portion of the CCF you'll see is has been reduced by $100 million, and that I explained a moment ago. If you wonder why the $46 million of CCF money that we will be using to purchase the ship is not also reclassified, since it's going to be withdrawn, that's because it will be used to purchase a long-term asset, so it remains classified as long-term or noncurrent. On the liability side, again we see the various effects of the reclassification of the commercial paper, the current with $100 million swap between the current and long-term debt. The balance of the current liabilities increase is several small items, including an increase in current taxes and an accrual for our upcoming dividend payment. The additional reduction in long-term debt over the $100 million reclassification reflects net repayments. On the next slide, the total debt at quarter-end was $314 million. Barring any sizable acquisitions in the third quarter, we would expect that this balance would be further reduced as the commercial paper retirement more than offsets the new Title 11 debt associated with the vessel. On the cash flow statement, we had very strong operating cash flows that enabled a $31 million net repayment of debt during the first half of the year. Capital Expenditures of 24 million in the first half represent only CapEx for property. By our internal definition, a big portion of the investment category here also is CapEx. That's cash committed to construction by our joint ventures, for example. In this case, it's almost entirely Hokua capital that's been put in during the first half. The all-other category that you see is the $29 million figure there. About $20 million of that is from proceeds from property sales and $9 million of that is the result of new equity from options exercises. The next slide shows our total CapEx for several periods. I introduced this slide in the previous quarter call with the 2004 projection and the 2003 actual CapEx figures. I've added here our year-to-date numbers. Total projected CapEx for the year remains around $250 million. Matson so far has had a most amount of container acquisitions and vessel and IT spending, and we will continue with both but its largest expenditure for the year remains the upcoming vessel purchase. Finally, properties spending year-to-date consists primarily of its investments in the Hokua and Lanikea projects as well as some of the joint venture activity that I mentioned a moment ago. You may recall that I mentioned, in the previous quarter, that the $81 million projection for this year does not include any acquisition capital or 10-31 reinvestments. As appropriate acquisitions are identified, this figure could increase materially. With that, I would like to turn it over to John Kelley, who has some good news about the Hawaii economy. John? John Kelley - Alexander & Baldwin - VP IR Thanks, Chris. In our last call, some of the data seemed to be showing deceleration. That hesitancy has since disappeared with growing confidence that the U.S. economy will continue to support higher visitor traffic and visitor spending. Moreover, Japan's economy seems to have found traction since then. Hawaii's two distinct housing markets, visitor investments on the neighbor islands and local first-time buyers and those who trade up, especially on Oahu, have continued to keep residential construction and purchasing 7 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

Last week, the July unemployment rate was announced at 3.1 percent, well below 4.4 percent a year ago and 5.6 percent nationwide in July. Economists noted that 12,000 jobs had been created since the year-ago period. Funding is progressing for several big and long-term military housing refurbishment and replacement efforts and with a Striker Brigade and its supporting C-17 aircraft being deployed to Hawaii, the short-term effects of Iraq troop deployments should be just that, short-term. With higher costs of housing and energy, there almost certainly will be a pickup in inflation, but it's certainly forecasted at this point to be relatively modest. Here are some quick trends in the visitor industry. Under visitor arrivals, May figures were 17 percent higher with international numbers now clearly lapping the Iraq and SARS month a year ago. Year-to-date through May also looked good with smoother, steadier international growth. The forecast presently by economists at the University of Hawaii is for this year to have a 6 percent-plus increase in visitors and about 5 percent-plus (inaudible) in '05. These strong visitor numbers show up similarly in hotel occupancy numbers for both May and year-to-date through May. One last item on the consumer front, auto demand forecasts continue to edge up higher. We used this slide in the last quarter and the previous 7.2 percent projected retail sales growth rate have now been raised to 9.9 percent according to HADA, Hawaii Automobile Dealers Association. With that, operator, we would like to move to ask for questions from our listeners. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Operator Thank you. Our question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). Nicholas Aberle. Nicholas Aberle - Caris & Co. - Analyst Good afternoon. Congratulations, guys. The first thing I was going to do was tip my hat to Jim but is he not around this afternoon? Unidentified Company Representative I think he's listening -- (Multiple Speakers). Nicholas Aberle - Caris & Co. - Analyst Matson obviously was a great performance in the quarter. I just wanted to quickly touch on the subject of Guam -- of the Guam Charter. How did the margins on the Guam Charter compare to the margins in the ocean transportation business between the U.S. mainland and Hawaii? Chris Benjamin - Alexander & Baldwin - CFO I think you can say, in general terms, that they would be higher. How much higher is a matter that depends on cost allocations that we do. The principle reason that they have been higher is due to the favorable Charter arrangement with APL that has been able to keep our transportation costs down. Nicholas Aberle - Caris & Co. - Analyst Could you provide a little bit more color with respect to exactly what happened in the negotiations and why the Charter is not going to be re-upped in 2006? 8 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

JULY 28, 2004 / 7:00PM, - Q2 2004 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO Yes, I can't provide too much color because there are continuing discussions, and I would say that these are somewhat of a confidential nature at this point, but we did find out, in late June, that APL had essentially changed its position and that we came to the conclusion, based upon this, these discussions and a meeting that took place in late June that more likely than not that the alliance was not going to be renewed on terms that would be economic to the Company. Nicholas Aberle - Caris & Co. - Analyst So it sounds like the developments were pretty unexpected in nature? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO Well, we knew that the alliance was going to terminate in February of 2006. We have been in discussions for more than a year, on and off, although they haven't been regular -- with APL -- but it wasn't until this meeting at the end of June that we came to a conclusion that it was reasonable that we would not have a new alliance relationship with APL. (multiple speakers) -- extended beyond that -- or extended the present alliance. Nicholas Aberle - Caris & Co. - Analyst I got it. With respect to Horizon Lines and new ownership there, have you seen any changes in the competitive environment? Do you think that, going forward, you'll have a chance to perhaps gain market share there over their current share? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO I wouldn't want to comment on our ability to increase our market share. We are always doing our best to provide good customer service and Matson does that and has done that. The change in ownership is very recent. We have not seen any material changes in the competitive environment at this stage. Nicholas Aberle - Caris & Co. - Analyst Wailea, 29 lots, 3 left at this point and then 17 parcels at the start -- how many parcels are left at Wailea? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO Well, we have, at this stage, sold or on a complete basis or an installment basis, three. With another in the process of sale; we are looking, as we noted just a few moments ago in the call, at a venture relationship on a fifth parcel. Nicholas Aberle - Caris & Co. - Analyst Okay, so one more is going to be sold for sure. Is it safe to say that the rest is going to be under some type of development, or is that still up in the air as to exactly what's in store for the rest of the parcels? 9 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

JULY 28, 2004 / 7:00PM, - Q2 2004 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO Yes, we have development plans but they are subject to changes based upon market conditions. We felt that it was prudent to sell, in a very favorable market environment, some of the parcels in bulk, which dramatically is reducing our net basis in that investment. But you can expect that, going forward, there will be a future of sales of joint venture developments and perhaps development on our own for the remaining parcels. Nicholas Aberle - Caris & Co. - Analyst So we saw sales get pushed up more into the first half of the year. We shouldn't expect obviously the same results in the back half. If the environment remains as robust as it was in the first half, do you think that you could churn some of the property unexpectedly from what your standpoint is right now if the environment continues to be good? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO The environment is good but we really don't have a lot of salable inventory that's ready to go and that could be closed this year. We've pretty much put in place and executed on most of the things that we had planned to do this year, so I doubt that we're going to have a material increase in our sales activity. In fact, as we said in the call, it's likely we're going to have a pattern for the second half of the year that's going to look a little like last year's second half. You might just want to go back and look at that slide, Nick. I know we went over it real fast today but that slide did show a very small amount of profit in the second half of the year in that segment. Nicholas Aberle - Caris & Co. - Analyst I got it. Then lastly, looking for a marginal profit on the food products segment in the second half, or for the full year -- I mean, worst-case scenario there, could we see this dip below and be a loss-making segment? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO At this stage, we think it's going to be marginally profitable. There's a possibility that it could dip into the red. Nicholas Aberle - Caris & Co. - Analyst Thank you very much and congratulations. Operator Justin Hughes. Justin Hughes - Jefferies & Co. - Analyst First of all, on the shipping side, can you give us a little bit of guidance on the second half of this year? What kind of contribution we should see from the Maunawili -- maybe I'm pronouncing that wrong -- to operating income as well as you have a new route between the big island and the mainland. 10 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

JULY 28, 2004 / 7:00PM, - Q2 2004 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO Yes, by the way, that's good pronunciation of the ship -- (LAUGHTER) -- the Maunawili. It's coming into service at the end of the year; you're not going to see very much of an impact, since it should be in the service and get broken in in the fourth quarter of this year. Really, when you look at it, just to reiterate what was said very quickly, when you take all of the factors together in terms of the rate increases that have taken place in the first half of the year, the contractual increases and longshore costs that we're going to have at mid-year that will show up as costs in the second half of the year, we think that Matson is going to continue to have very good performance for this year but that its profit margin will not be as high as it was this quarter, which was as high as we've seen in quite a long time. So, in terms of what we are projecting for the rest of the year, we're going to have a good year. We are just not going to be showing the type of margins that we experienced in the latest quarter for the second half of the year. Justin Hughes - Jefferies & Co. - Analyst Maybe I can just ask the question in a different way. Can you give us maybe an operating income contribution you could expect from this ship on an annual basis? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO No, I really am not in a position to do that. I do -- in terms of the ship, though, I can say that, on a return-on-investment basis, we have gone through this. When we made the decision, the decision was made to acquire two vessels. The economics were favorable to the Company and as a result, the investment was made. One ship has been in service now for not a year but approaching a year. It has performed very well. The second ship will be in service in the next couple of months, and we expect good performance there. So, I can answer the question this way -- that, based upon the original assumptions that were made on the operation of the ship, that it is performing at or above our expectations. Justin Hughes - Jefferies & Co. - Analyst Then on your -- in the Sea Star investment, how much cash will you be getting from that? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO We should be getting about $7 million in cash and guarantee elimination on debt. Justin Hughes - Jefferies & Co. - Analyst Okay. Then on the development side on the Kauai project that you just talked about today when you got full approval for it, the 1200 to 1500 units, will you just be selling the lots or are those going to be fully developed? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO We are in the process of preparing some final development plans that are being led by our partner, D&B Associates. We will be in a position to give our investors a much more detailed perspective on this project in the next 6 to 12 months. It could be a combination of both. 11 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

JULY 28, 2004 / 7:00PM, - Q2 2004 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Justin Hughes - Jefferies & Co. - Analyst Can you give us -- even if it's a huge range -- how much you think an individual lot could go for? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO It's substantial. It's going to be a very substantial amount of money. The lots are going to be, depending upon the size of the lot and its location, this is going to be an upscale project but in terms of individual lot pricing, it's a bit premature on that -- (Multiple Speakers). Justin Hughes - Jefferies & Co. - Analyst It looks like it's actually in a better location, at least closer to the water than your Mauna Lani resort. So would that be at least a decent comp? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO They are not quite comparable but I can say this, that both projects are very attractive. The different is that the Mauna Lani project is a subdivision of an existing, very successful development of Kona where the Kukui'Ula project is in effect an entirely new residential development. Justin Hughes - Jefferies & Co. - Analyst Are you still there? That's the one by the Four Seasons right? I think that you were talking about in the Mauna Lani? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO Yes, it's a little bit away, a couple of miles distance. Operator (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). Tom Spiro (ph). Tom Spiro - Spiro Capital - Analyst Tom Spiro, Spiro (ph) Capital. Aloha! That was some quarter. Congratulations. Particularly Matson's results were striking. Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO We will convey that to Matson and I know that some of our Matson management, including Jim Andrasick and his key staff members, are listing. Tom Spiro - Spiro Capital - Analyst I have a couple of questions. I will start with Matson. I noticed that, for the quarter, the Hawaiian container volume was up 1 percent. You mentioned that the Hawaiian-bound, I guess that's westbound containers, were up 4. The guess that means that eastbound was down something like 3 percent. I kind of curious, if my understanding is correct, why that should be. 12 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

JULY 28, 2004 / 7:00PM, - Q2 2004 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO Yes, the eastbound volume was down fairly significantly, and that's a result of a number of factors. It's more agriculturally driven activity than anything else, and it's also a lot lower-rated freight than westbound. The differential in container rates is pretty significant between westbound, where we sail pretty much full, and eastbound, where there is a lot more vacancy, so to speak, in our ships. Tom Spiro - Spiro Capital - Analyst Do you expect the eastbound weakness to continue? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO I can't tell you that with any degree of precision. Really, the eastbound traffic has a lot to do with agricultural activity and cattle-related activity in the States. Those are the principle users of eastbound. In addition, we have military moves as well, which are fairly substantial. I know that one factor -- and I can't at the moment give you the specifics on it -- but the Iraqi war has removed a number of combat personnel from Hawaii, but what is has done is it's also in effect stopped movements of many goods and household goods out of the state because basically people have been sort of frozen into their current posts and duty stations. (multiple speakers) -- happening. Tom Spiro - Spiro Capital - Analyst On the Guam situation, you've mentioned that the APL contract or I guess the termination of it may result in a diminution in our operating profits of roughly 10 to $20 million. I wasn't sure if that number was before our coming up with alternative arrangements or after that. That is to say, are there things that we can do to moderate that 10 to $20 million diminution or is that it? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO It basically assumes that we have a successor service in place, and that is the net effect of the change on the Guam market. As we said, and I will just read it for you -- I'm going to find it here in our 10-Q. You probably haven't had a chance to look at it yet, but I would also just note, in the Q, we say "Unrelated in the Guam service, Matson intends to further moderate the estimated reduction in operating profit in the Guam service described through a combination of cost reductions, organic growth acquisitions and yield management initiatives." So, the number you see is related to the APL Guam market. But unrelated to that, obviously the Company intends to do what it can to moderate the reductions. Tom Spiro - Spiro Capital - Analyst I see. Okay, thanks. Over on the real estate side, I think you mentioned, Allen, in a prior call, that the Hawaiian office market has been a little bit weak. Is it starting to strengthen as the Hawaiian economy strengthens? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO Yes, that's a good question, Tom. We are seeing glimmers -- (LAUGHTER) -- of improvement. The vacancy rates are starting to drop and rates for leasing, if they are not going up dramatically at least have stabilized, so we are seeing some glimmers now of a slight shift in the office market place in Honolulu. 13 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

JULY 28, 2004 / 7:00PM, - Q2 2004 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Tom Spiro - Spiro Capital - Analyst Great. I'll ask one more and then I'll get back in queue. Staying with real estate, as you talked through some of the upcoming real estate projects and as I look at our 32 million, 34 million of operating profits so far this year, it looks to me like we are entering a period -- '04, '05, '06, '07 -- of unusually robust profits from real estate sales. I guess we are beginning to harvest those wise investments that you made in the prior five years. Is that a fair characterization of the period we are about to enter? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO That is a dual-edged sword! (LAUGHTER) (indiscernible). Yes, we've timed our acquisition activity very well and I do really want to compliment our real estate people for a tremendous amount of positive effort. We've made these 20 investments outside of our company lands; we've stayed very disciplined in the process. We are in a harvest mode for some of those investments; some of them, we're not in a harvest mode but we will be in the next couple of years. Our challenge, Tom, is to continue to find good investments that are going to take us beyond the next year or two, into the next three to five-year period, and realize benefits for our shareholders on those. That's what we're doing. Mauna Lani is one example of that. The Kukui'Ula project, while it is on our Company lands, could well be a very significant contributor to the Company's income for a period of 10 years or more. Tom Spiro - Spiro Capital - Analyst Those 20 investments that you mentioned, in round numbers, how much did we pay to make those acquisitions? Do you have some sort of an aggregate number or is there some other way we can get a sense of how much capital we directed in that area? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO We've really put in more than $400 million but it's a little deceptive because the total investment value is considerably higher than that. For example, the Hokua project, we're putting in $40 million. It's a $200 million cost deal that, if you multiply the number of units by $1 million, you know, it's got 250, $260 million of return on it. So, that will give you some perspective on our investment basis, but it's probably understated the value of these projects in aggregate. Tom Spiro - Spiro Capital - Analyst Thanks much. I will get back in queue. Operator Diane Daggett. Diane Daggett - Vulcan - Analyst Just a couple of quick questions -- in terms of shipping for the second half, can we expect operating margins to be in the 10 to 12 percent range that they've been in for several quarters prior to this 15 percent operating margin quarter? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO We are not in a position to give specific forecasts on operating margin per quarter; we just haven't done that. I can just say that we just wanted to caution everyone that a 15 percent margin was an excellent margin for the second quarter. Usually, our third quarter is the highest; we expect to have a very good third quarter, and so we're going to have very good margins there. We will have good margins in the fourth quarter, we expect, 14 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

JULY 28, 2004 / 7:00PM, - Q2 2004 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call but the fourth quarter is historically not that strong. So, you'll see good margins for the rest of the year, we believe. We're just offering a slight bit of caution that we had an exceptional second quarter. Diane Daggett - Vulcan - Analyst Okay. Just one question on the real estate side -- last year, there was approximately two-thirds of your property sales in the first half. Should we kind of think of it as that way for this year, or is it significantly different? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO Actually, I wish we could go back to the slide that shows that on our presentation, but it's actually going to be a higher percentage than that and I can't give you a specific number. But for the year, we are going to be able to show a very nice increase on a full-year basis versus 2003, but we've done most of what we said we were going to do and which we had planned to do and which we had prepared to do in terms of salable inventory in the first half of the year. Diane Daggett - Vulcan - Analyst Right, okay, but it doesn't sound like it's going to be down from a year ago in the second half? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO I can't comment on that. Diane Daggett - Vulcan - Analyst Okay. Well, good quarter. Thank you. Operator (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). Tom Spiro. Tom Spiro - Spiro Capital - Analyst I was hoping to touch upon the subject of a corporate liquidity. Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO Good, because I'm tired of talking! I'm going to get Chris in here, maybe John! Tom Spiro - Spiro Capital - Analyst It seems to me, as a look at your financial statements and the Company's earnings, the prospects this year, that you guys are awash in liquidity. You don't have much in the way of debt. Your earnings are robust and my crystal ball is no better than yours but I imagine it will stay take quite strong. You generate lots of depreciation and I was kind of curious what you're going to do with all that cash. I saw you nibbled on some stock. I was very pleased that you did that and I hope you will continue, but what are your thoughts about liquidity? 15 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

JULY 28, 2004 / 7:00PM, - Q2 2004 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO Chris, why don't you just start in terms of the current financial position and then we will make a comment or two in response? Chris Benjamin - Alexander & Baldwin - CFO Sure. You are right; our cash balances have been increasing. We, at this point, decide the commercial paper program, which I've already mentioned, we will be retiring. We have very little, if any, floating-rate -- variable-rate debt at this time, so we are in a position of very strong liquidity. I think it's our expectation and hope, although we have nothing immediately in the pipeline, that we will be undertaking additional investments this year, but of course, that's always difficult to predict. To the extent that -- a subtext in your question is related to returning cash to shareholders. I think, at this point, we are, as always, certainly mindful of the various investment options we have, one of which is returning cash to shareholders, but at this point, we evaluate that as we always have before. Our focus right now is on development or identification of investment opportunities. So, we are in a very strong financial position; we are right now at 27 percent debt-to-total capital. That will come down somewhat in the third quarter, as I mentioned earlier, and we are actively looking for investment opportunities. It's difficult to be predict exactly when and how big those will be but that's our perspective right now. Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO Tom, on the question of repurchases, you know, they represent a trade-off at any one moment between several possible uses of cash. You know, we look at the cash we have; we make a judgment on our ongoing needs in the business, the investments that we have to make in the future, the stock price, the cost level, the debt, the tax issues, and our dividends, and we make a determination. We have had a history, although not much of a recent history, of repurchasing stock. You know, we like to do what the market does. We like to buy it when it seems to be a good value and when that's the best alternative that we have. So, in terms of that stock-repurchase issue, we did make a nominal investment in the quarter and we haven't done that, as we noted, for several years. In terms of our acquisition activity, our objective is not to place money but it's to make money. Right now, we are in a little bit of a seller's market and we are selling. We could be in a buyer's market, which means we're not going to sell as much but we would have some very good buying opportunities, which we did for several years. As Chris said, though, we're looking at several possibilities, not only in real estate but also at Matson, for some investments that are going to the accretive and beneficial to our shareholders. So, we're not sitting around counting the capital and cash in the treasury; we're looking at all the alternatives we have to utilize it. Tom Spiro - Spiro Capital - Analyst Well, I'm glad you're looking at all the alternatives. I applaud you for nibbling on the stock; I'm glad you did that. Given the change in the tax treatment of dividends that occurred not long ago, I hope you will give serious consideration to raising the dividend rate as well. But most importantly, I just wanted to congratulate you on the quarter. Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO Thank you and I will extend that again, Tom, to the operating people here who all made it -- they made it happen. 16 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

JULY 28, 2004 / 7:00PM, - Q2 2004 Alexander & Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Operator Another follow-up question from Diane Daggett. Diane Daggett - Vulcan - Analyst I was just wondering when you will be in a position to give us some guidance for 2005. Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO Probably when we put our 2005 operating plan together, which will be in the fourth quarter of this year. Diane Daggett - Vulcan - Analyst Okay, so probably on the fourth-quarter conference call? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO Maybe later than that, but we will let you know when we can provide some sense of where we think 2005 is going to take us. Diane Daggett - Vulcan - Analyst Okay, thank you. Operator There are no further questions at this time. Gentlemen, I will turn the conference back over to you for any further or closing comments. Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President, CEO We thank you for your participation. Aloha, good day. Operator Once again, that does conclude today's conference call.

CORPORATE PARTICIPANTS Sean McHugh Office Depot Inc. - Director, IR Neil Austrian Office Depot Inc. - Chairman, CEO Chuck Rubin Office Depot Inc. - EVP, Marketing & Merchandizing Rolf van Kaldekerken Office Depot Inc. - President, European Operations Charlie Brown Office Depot Inc. - EVP & CFO Mark Holifield Office Depot Inc. - EVP, Supply Chain Rick Lepley Office Depot Inc. - EVP, NA Retail Monica Luechtefeld Office Depot Inc. - Global E-Commerce George Hill Office Depot Inc. - SVP, NA Retail Operations Cindy Campbell Office Depot Inc. - EVP, NA Delivery Sales PRESENTATION Operator Good morning, my name is Sean McHugh and I'm Office Depot's Director of Investor Relations. I'm very pleased to welcome everyone to Office Depot's 2004 Analyst Meeting. Before we kick off today's events, I have several items I'd like to pass along. First a brief safe harbor statement. Except for historical information, matters discussed today are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed at today's meeting. These risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in our SEC findings and you may find them at various public webs sites including sec.gov and freeedgar.com. Second, we welcome your questions today. Each presenter has allocated time for a Q&A period during his or her segment. To aid the presenters and the rest of the audience, I would ask that you use some of the floor microphones we'll have circulating throughout the audience. And now, without further delay, I'm very pleased to introduce Neil Austrian, Office Depot's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Neil Austrian - Office Depot Inc. - Chairman, CEO Thanks Sean. Good morning. I'm delighted to be here, have all of you here, thank you all very much for coming. Hopefully those of you who were here last night at our small cocktail reception had a chance to meet a large number of the management team that we brought here. And hopefully that dialog at least started to answer some of the questions that you might have. Several of you asked why we're having this meeting today, because a number of you thought that given the change in management we'd probably cancel this meeting. And I think the more we've talked about it, we've decided that we ought to come here, because it's the right thing to do. I think this meeting will give you a chance to assess our management team and get a pretty clear understanding that we do have considerable debt. And hopefully, by the end of the meeting we'll be convinced we're not standing still waiting for a permanent CEO to arrive. Let's take a minute and look at the agenda today. 2 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting After I give a few other remarks, Chuck Rubin who's head of merchandising and marketing will talk, and Mark Holifield who runs our supply chain is going to talk about where we are, as well as an update on our Magellan merchandising project. We'll take a quick break, and Rick Lepley and Monica Luechtefeld will talk about North American Retail and our entry into the Northeast. We'll break for lunch, and Cindy Campbell will talk about our North American delivery sales, followed by Rolf van Kaldekerken who will update us on International. Charles Brown to talk about where we are financially, and then I'll make some closing remarks, and we'll be prepared to have some considerable discussion at your leisure. But before we formally begin, a large number of questions came up last night, where it probably makes sense to try and address those up front. And that will hopefully provide some definition on a number of these issues that you're going to be hearing about a little bit later. The first question I got asked last night was wasn't this change in management sudden, and how did the board come to a decision at that point in time to make a change in management? If you look at the Board of Directors of this company it's a pretty unique and pretty talented board. There also are four new board members that joined our board in the last year. David Bernauer who is the CEO of Walgreen's, Al Bru who had run Frito Lay, Pat McKay who is the CFO of Restoration Hardware, Myra Hart who now teaches at Harvard but was one of the original people in the management team at Staples. The board has been talking for quite a while about how the company was performing and executing. It's certainly not a mystery to you that we have not done as well as we think we can do and should do. The board had had discussions with groups at the end of the 2003 year end and became increasingly concerned during 2004 that we really weren't executing the way we should on the strategies that had been adopted. There's never a good time to make a change. Bruce and I talked about that when I got down here. I helped hire Bruce back at Viking Office Products. And I think Bruce would tell you today that waiting to year end all it did was probably prolong three or four months in terms of our timetable to find a new CEO. And I think the board felt, that putting this in motion today, we'd be in a position hopefully to have a CEO in place by the first quarter of next year such that that individual could and would have an impact on fiscal 2005. At the end of the meeting I'll talk a little about where we are in the search process and an update as to the time table as well as the characteristics and the job specs of the CEO that we're looking for. Second question that came up is you're brand new, how can you be making all these decisions? Do you have any confidence in the management and how can you even assess the management team? Aren't they all new as well? Well, clearly I'm new as the CEO here; I'm not new to Office Depot. In 1998 when I was at Dillon Reed co-heading their leverage buy out group, we bought Viking Office Products, and I got to meet and spend a large, large amount of time with Irwin Helford (ph). I joined the Board of Viking in 1988, became a board member of Office Depot in 1998 and Office Depot acquired Viking. And I've chaired the finance committee here at Office Depot for the last several years which gave me a very good opportunity to get to know virtually all the people who are reporting to me today as well as some of the people that work for them several ranks down in the management. I wouldn't say that I'm totally new, I can't claim that I know everything about this industry or business but what I will say is I didn't come in cold. A lot of the decisions that have been made were in the works. A lot of planning has been done, a lot of discussion had been done. If I take any credit at all, very small, all I did was enable the rest of the management team to make those decisions and go ahead so that they were empowered and took ownership for the decision. If you look at the management team today, what's surprising is how long a lot of them have been here and the talent level that we've got that stayed even though we've changed at the top one or two times. Look at Europe for a minute, which we'll talk about a little later. Rolf van Kaldekerken I got to know, in 1994 when Irwin hired Rolf and I got to meet Rolf when he headed up our German operation. 3 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting Graham Cundick who's here, is Senior VP of merchandising and marketing for Europe, Irwin hired, 1990. Wim van Aalst was hired in 2000 who heads our supply chain in Europe and Rob Vale who runs the European operations in 1999. So what you have is a combined 34 years experience in Europe with our top four people. If you look at the domestic operations, Charlie Brown, our CFO came in 1998. Cindy Campbell who is now running BSG has been with the company since 1995. Mark Holifield who runs our supply chain, he's been here 10 years he came in 1994. Monica Luechtefeld has been here since 1993. Frank Scruggs who heads Human Resources is new to the company in his role as EVP, Human Resources but Frank and I served as directors together at Office Depot for over seven years. Rick Lepley who runs retail, most of you think he's new to the company. Rick actually formally joined Office Depot in 1995 in Eastern Europe and he started his company, it was doing business with Office Depot in 1993. Rick went to Japan in 2001 and came back in 2003. And he and a SWAT team of guys who were really instrumental in putting together the M2 concept for our new stores. Patty Morrison is new. Patty is our Chief Information Officer, she's been here a little over 2.5 years, prior to that she was the CIO at Quaker Oats and before that for a $6 billion division at GE. And the newest person, Chuck Rubin. Chuck is the head of merchandising and marketing, he's been here a little less than a year, but worked with the company in his role as a consultant at Accenture. So you add up those people, you've got about 53 years of combined experience in terms of the direct reports. I've got a lot of confidence in them, I've spoken at length with all of them. And I think the statement I can make today is that they're all totally committed to the company, just as I am and I'm really not concerned at this point in time - or if somebody comes up here and tells me differently  [laughter] which is saying the least. It's a very good group; it's a group they're keeping. I think any new CEO coming in, is going to look at the talent level that we have, and be pretty happy. There's a natural worry about us entering the Northeast. A number of you asked us last night, why are you doing this instead of opening more stores in the market that you currently dominate? I think we can do both. My question is why give up a third of the United States to a competitor? Basically when you look at our two businesses one of, not the only, but one of the major reasons you have a margin difference is a much larger percentage of their stores are in areas where they're the only ones there. We believe there's room for two competitors. We also believe that we're not going to do things on an irrational basis. I think we've got enough financial tools in place and enough controls in place that we're not going to do things that aren't productive. Can we make money in the Northeast? All the signs say that we can. Do we expect Staples to fight back aggressively? You bet. The same way we're going to fight in Chicago to defend the territory that we've got. You know it's a trade off of short term profits today versus long-term gains tomorrow. And I think those of us who are here running the company believe on a long-term basis it makes sense. If I can use the sports analogy that John Madden gave me. John told me when you play not lose, you've already lost. What I can commit to you is that we're not about to lose. A number of you worry about the cost cuts. Half of you that talked to me last night said we cut too deep. The other half said you didn't cut enough. I think many, if not all the initiatives, other than the corporate headquarters, were being worked on by the management team when I got here. And I think all it took was a little nudge to say what's the right thing to do. When you look at the decision that was made in terms of outsourcing our call centers, an awful lot of work went into that. And an awful lot of analysis was done by Tim McGrath who runs our call centers and has been 4 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting here for five years. Looking at the research that pulled up through the voice of the customer, whether or not we were giving up customer service. Because quite honestly we were already using two of those outsourced call centers to handle some of our problems at the time. The other rumor that went around last night was that we're going to outsource everything. I don't think that's true either. I think what we're looking at is, a way to rationalize the business, the cost side of the business, and use those resources to grow the top line. I don't believe the outsourcing in any way, shape or form represents to anyone that this is a company in trouble. I look at this business as an operating turnaround, not a financial turnaround. This is one of the strongest businesses that I've seen. We've got over $1 billion in cash. We've got enormous cash flow. We've made our bets in three principle areas, U.S. retail, U.S. contract, European contract, and mail order, and I think now is a question of just executing on that. Interestingly enough, you'll see some of those (inaudible) to check outs, our customers think we're doing something right. When you look at our customer research, they tell us we're doing pretty well. And that's the voice I'd listen to, rather than the voice of our competitors. I was asked in hindsight, would I make the acquisition of Guilbert. Absolutely, absolutely. We got the cost savings that Rolf and his team had projected when we made that acquisition. What we didn't get were the sales increases that we thought were inherent in the business where we could change the culture of the Guilbert sales force that Rolf will talk about, and we missed. But I think we're back on the right track. Finally, I was asked, do I have a vision for this company, where do I think it can go. That's a little hard to answer after six weeks. But having sat on the board, and having listened to so many presentations, you get a sense of what could be. And you look down the road, and I don't see any reason why a retail business can't do 6.5 to 7% profit. I don't see any reason why Cindy's group can't do 8%. I don't see any reason why in Europe, we can't do 12%. What does that mean to the bottom line, somewhere between 5.5, 6% pre tax. I think we can do that. I think it's just going to take a little bit of time and a lot of work. Let me take a few minutes for those of you not familiar with Office Depot and kind of look at some very topline kind of information that will set the stage for today. We're basically a $13 billion business, $13.5 Charlie reminds me. It's a big business. Retail is 34% of the company, our BSG group is 30%, International is 26%. And embedded in all those numbers is our e-commerce business which is approaching $3 billion. And that's primarily seen today in our contract side. Business unit structure. North America is approaching $5.8 billion with 923 stores in the U.S. and Canada. Business service group, $4 billion, they cut across contract, catalog, e-commerce. Our for sure business is technology up in Bristol, which basically is catalog and telephone. In our international group with $3.5 billion, which really is -- serves every kind of channel today, catalog, contract, e-commerce, retail. Our Office Depot catalog, our Viking catalog, because their sales force are in 21 different countries. We can sell to customers of any size. Through our retail business, we service consumers, independent professionals, small companies. Even our large contract customers come into the stores with their preferred customer card. The catalog shot basically drops down at some point to consumers but is mainly geared toward independent professionals and small business. Contracts, both domestically and internationally, it's mainly geared to medium business and our large corporations. And basically everybody that we touch shops through the internet. We've grown the business pretty well. Basically today we operate in 23 countries, about 900 plus stores in North American, 76 owned stores internationally, another 150 stores we operate under the Office Depot name under a joint venture. 5 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting We've got 2,800, 2,900 contract sales people on a global basis. Over 40 e-commerce sites, over 50 warehouses and distribution centers, 36 call centers that will go down by about 10 as we consolidate the domestic call center business. Eight thousand skews at the store level, 14,000 in our delivery system and over 46,000 employees. When I came to the company as the Chief Executive, I tried to articulate three priorities we were going to focus on. These aren't new priorities, the point being I wanted everyone in the company to understand that there were three mission critical things we had to do this year and focus all of our efforts on these three things. What it means is a lot of nice to do things aren't going to get done. Improve North America retail profitability and continue the Northeast expansion. The steady growth increase, our market share in BSG and to our European colleagues, put the growth back and integrate the Guilbert sales force so that we can get back to where we should be in Europe. I think it's pretty clear to me at least now, everybody in the company understands these three priorities. There is no ambiguity whatsoever. And what we've done, is place accountability in the hands of the people that can make it happen. Why North American retail? It's pretty clear. It's 44% of our sales, 28% of our operating profit on a segment basis. I know a number of you have asked how we're allocating all of our G&A. It's not going to change it a whole lot, even if it did, there's not I'm going to do about it right now, because I can't get rid of all the G&A that would go with any of the segments. It's pretty clear that we have an opportunity, when you look at competition, to improve our North American retail profitability. So where does this leave us and what's different today than when you were here a year ago? Far fewer initiatives, much improved focus to the company. Rick Lepley has profit and loss for the stores. Cindy Campbell has profit and loss for the BSG group. Rolf has always had profitability for Europe. That does not mean that Mark Holifield, and the supply chain, and Chuck Rubin in merchandising don't have a very, very strong and powerful voice and input. What it means is I expect Rick and Cindy to fight with them, to make sure we get the kind of profits we need, and if at the end of the day they can't agree, then they can come to me. But without this kind of accountability, nobody owns the profits. What are the objectives that we've got for today? It's clear that we recognize we've got several problems that have to be addressed. We hope today is going to give you some insight as to how we plan to address them in the timetable. It's pretty clear we cannot cost reduce our way out of the problems we've got. This is a top line growth issue that we have today. Yes we make some cuts, the organization understands it's not business as usual. But at the same time, the way we're going to increase shareholder value is through sales growth, both at retail, and in our BSG group. We've got retail gross margins we have to deal with. You're going to hear today about the technology initiatives, what we're planning to do with attachment rates, and what we plan to do to drive supplies next year. How new store openings are going to help, both in the Northeast, and in the areas we now have dominance. We're going to address who are key customers are, and what that customer wants and needs from Office Depot. We're going to utilize merchandising and our supply chain as a competitive advantage, which we believe we have today in both those organizations. And finally, focus critically on the top line of the three business units that I have talked about. I'm happy to take questions at the end of the meeting when I wrap up, which I think is more appropriate, I'll give you some update on the search at that point in time. At this point, I'd like to ask Chuck Rubin to come up who's our EVP of marketing and merchandising. 6 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting Chuck Rubin - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, Marketing & Merchandizing Good morning everybody. It's nice to be here, it was nice speaking with some of you last night. To get started let me introduce two members of my team who joined us on this trip who I'm proud to have here. First, Wilson Zhu who is our Vice President of Private Brand and Global Sourcing and definitely sitting next to him is Tony Ueber who is Vice President of our Marketing Strategy, branding and decision support area, as I say, I'm very happy to have them here. In reference to build on what Neil is talking about, each of them have been with Office Depot about two years. So I truly am the newest guy here on the block. Earlier this year we combined the merchandising and marketing organizations with both reporting to me. This integration supports some of the things that you'll hear throughout today. This allowed us to plan and execute in a more effect and more structure and a more purposeful way with clearly responsibilities. Specifically, we've developed a strategy that's more unified and more customer centric. It's begun to manifest itself and it will continue to manifest itself in a few different ways. Firstly, in how we position the brand, secondly in the product mix that we offer and thirdly in how we develop our private brand strategies. Of course, the strategy has to be enabled by the appropriate mechanisms. In our case there are three critical ones. One is the analytical rigor which balances the art and science of retail. Secondly as a much more disciplined process orientation which will not only help us improve our business in the short term but in fact sustain it long term. And thirdly, an organization that in my case is a group of marketers and merchants who have integrated and focused on the same purpose, which will improve the collaboration and the execution of our efforts. The ultimate goal of this is obviously to more efficiently reach our target audience, with relevant product assortments and messages that speak to them. So for customer centric, let me start my comments with a little bit more about who that customer really is. As you can see in this chart, the vast majority of our customers, in fact even a higher majority of our revenue is derived out of our business customer. This group has not always been our clear focus. For 2005, it has to be. Our efforts, our resources, will be dedicated to stressing the assortment for the marketing vehicles to speak for this group. In terms of brand awareness, let's take a look at how customers view Office Depot. As you can see on a national basis, along with our competition, we all have pretty high brand awareness in the 90 plus percentile range. In terms of top of mind performance which is the box towards the bottom which is framed out, our top of mind performance is higher than Office Max and slightly behind Staples. It's important to note that this high brand awareness, that we're very pleased with these results given that we're not in the Northeast where as Neil mentioned, over a third of the national GDP is generated. In terms of brand perceptions, our business customers rate us very highly on core brand functional components. Things around value, convenience, products and service, those are the four blocks that are presented up here. And in fact, Office Depot is at parity with Staples and on most factors, is significantly better than Office Max. In terms of brand loyalty, Office Depot scores higher than Office Max and Staples and if a look at the core components of loyalty, things like satisfaction and willingness to recommend, we come out higher than both of our key competitors. So for 2005, we need to build up a strong brand recognition and customer loyalty. However, to prepare for this, we have been and we will continue to address issues that have restrained our performance this past year and even before that. Specifically, issues that included a customer definition that was too broad, we included consumers as well as business customers more than we should have. A brand benefit that was not clearly articulated and a creative campaign that was not targeted at this core business customer, really differentiated from our competition. 7 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting To achieve our 2005 financial goals, we have taken a number of options to address these issues. Specifically, we expanded the Office Depot Advantage Loyalty Program and I'll speak more to this in a moment. We've developed and we will continue to develop more tools to make our marketing spend more efficient and cost effective and again I'll speak to this in a moment. We're defining a more distinct brand benefit that's closely in line with the needs of our core business customer. This we believe will allow us, being the largest share of their wallet as well as further attracting more desirable new customers. Fourth, well be deploying a new creative direction that will speak to our core business customer. And fifth, we're activating this clearer brand positioning for a refined product assortment that will better target this business customer. This will reflect itself in things like package sizes and in terms of the type of license product that you see in some of our competition. Our Advantage Loyalty Program, which is now about nine months old, continues to grow and exceed our membership plans with almost two million members to date. As we look at 2005, we're targeting a membership of 3.3 million. These numbers are proving to be the right kind of customer, with close to 60% of them business members. And compared to our average customer, they're spending on average three times as much per purchase and are stopping more frequently within our different channels. Obviously those two together, you end up spending more money with us annually. Additionally, one half of them are newly identified retail customers which allow us to learn more and target them better. Given the critical mass that we've now reached, we're close to the two million numbers. We're already begun targeted marketing efforts and we're very encouraged with the results we've seen so far. In 2005, well continue to invest in the advantage program with the goal of growing our share wallet, adding new customers and ensuring that current customers stay with us. We'll further integrate our Advantage Program into existing marketing vehicles and leverage the earnings into our assortment and pricing strategies. We will also augment the program by offering incremental benefits to our advantage members by partnering with appropriate third parties. I mentioned a minute ago some of the new analytical tools used by both the marketing and merchandising organization to allow our marketing spend to be more effective in driving profitable sales as well as being more cost efficient. One such tool set, very aggressive in our insert spend which is the largest chunk of our media spend. Now on the screen you see an example, it's actually a live example, with the departments that have been camouflaged, if you will. But what it shows that in an analysis of our 2003 spend, reflected for instance with department A, that it was receiving very little insert space even though it was quite responsive to the advertising, meaning that it was driving significant incremental performance, not absolute performance but incremental performance over the norm. That compared to department C which was receiving more space, that's the red off to the left, even though department C was less responsive. We're not alone in this kind of misappropriation of space. It's quite a common problem for many retailers and certainly Office Depot was guilty of this. Our solution was to develop and deploy a standardized methodology to optimize the allocation of space by category and product and in fact even the overall size of the insert. We were forced to consider various options in allocating space across product categories and items. And some products in fact have received significantly more space while others less. To put it a different way, what we implemented in what we'll continue to utilize is an earned space model with products earned in space as opposed to being entitled to it. It's a process where art and science are blended. Nonetheless, one that's really not all that common amongst many retailers. We're very pleased with the results so far and this program will continue into 2005 as we continue to try to leverage our media strength to make it more efficient. 8 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting I spoke a bit about our customers and a bit about our marketing practices. Let me talk a little bit about our products, what we sell. This slide shows that customers rate our product selection very highly. In fact, when it comes to the breadth of our office supplies and breadth of our suppliers as well as providing a true one stop shopping environment, we score higher than our competition. We view this as a true competitive edge against any of our competitors whether they're the primary Staples and Office Max and also Warehouse Clubs and Discounters. A look at the Office Depot mix of product sales, showing that technology is increasing the penetration compared to 2003, while furniture and office supplies has been reduced. In fact, our 2004 mix is pretty comparable to what 2002 shook out to be. Now while Ill talk a bit more in detail in a moment about both technology and supplies, let me address that overall mix of product sales. Overall, our margins have suffered as a result of this mix towards technology and you're all aware of that, we talked about that in previous calls. Throughout this past year we've invested heavily in technology through people, through marketing efforts and through the focus of a number of folks who work within the company. Some of us suggested that this is an overinvestment on our part. We do not believe this. Instead, we remain committed that technology is accretive, not dilutive to our business. What we really do believe is that we have underinvested in our supplies business. We have put too little space, too little focus, too little support into that business. And this will clearly change as we move into 2005. Let me step back for a second and set the context of our business customers overall purchase pattern. This is an industry- wide view which highlights where office product shoppers spend their money. It exposes that just over half of their spend is allocated to technology purchases with about a third of their spend in basic office supplies and the balance for about 16% into furniture. These numbers support the different businesses that we're committed to and we'll remain committed to them as we remain in 2005. In terms of technology, as the year progressed, our strategy focused more on our core business customer. This slide reflects the mix of desktops to notebooks which is apparently about 50/50 with laptops obviously being more business oriented as I'm sure most of you who are carrying them around today in your briefcases can attest to. Laptops, along with our CTO offerings as a proprietary offering are configured, or their custom build program are more profitable than the conventional desktops and drive higher attachment rates of higher margin accessories. With the help of Mark's inventory management team, we've done a terrific job of managing our inventory in our technology area and had very, very little end of life exposure on that inventory. This slide shows the frequency of office supply purchases. Now you'll note the middle row in the blue, technology is certainly more than an occasional purchase for the business customer. But it truly is office supplies, core office supplies that drive the frequency of purchase and obviously the higher overall margins that we're seeking. As I mentioned a moment ago, it's the supplies business that's been most disappointing for Office Depot over the past year and even before. While they've done a very good job of managing our gross margin rates, we have not achieved acceptable sales levels. This must change for us to deliver a better blended gross margin for 2005. As we look ahead, we have a number of efforts in place to improve our performance both in sales and margin. Let me give you a sense of just a few of those. Firstly, we'll be streamlining our assortments so that they are easier for customers to understand and shop, particularly at retail. For example, currently we are implementing in the stores a new binder, the three ring binders that carry, which is a large profitable business for us. We're opening up a new binder retail plan-o-gram, which is based on actual customer shopping patterns and we believe will get us back to a higher sales level and a more friendly environment for our customers. Secondly, new products and alliances that add newness to what is sometimes perceived as a very vanilla category in office supplies will be introduced. Thirdly, new pricing strategies that encourage multiple item purchasing, that optimize gross margins and will be reinforced and we believe this will be particularly attractive to our core business target customer. We have products to enhance the attachment rates in supplies to other product 9 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

For instance ink to printers will be intensified. We'll be score carding performance on attachments closely and selectively tying salespeoples' pay to that performance. Fifth, well be increasing marketing through marketing media specifically targeted to our core business customer. With supplies, for example during Q1 of '04 which is a critical back to business timeframe, we were underrepresented in key supplies categories. This will change as we move toward 2005. Six, we've strengthened our organizational capabilities and I'll talk about that in a few moments. And finally seven, we will be expanding our private brand offerings. Private brand is a significant goal for us at Office Depot. Our surveys show that nearly all office supply shoppers have bought at one point a store brand during the past year. Most said that they selected it because of a lower price. But historically, not just for office supply companies, but for lots of retailers, private brand has really served as an opening price point strategy. Leave the brands to carry the quality and the time frame would be the price point. We believe this presents one of the largest opportunities for Office Depot in all businesses, but particularly in supplies where there is such commoditization. This is a snapshot of our performance in 2004 compared to 2002. Look at our private brand, and you'll see that for this year, it will represent about 15% of our total revenue and be spread across about 2,300 SKUs a significant increase since 2002. During that time, we have expanded and repurposed our Office Depot brand to maintain a consistent quality and value proposition across all categories that we carry. We've also devised other brands beyond Office Depot to target key product niches. Things like Foray, writing instruments and Christopher Lowell furniture. You'll note that that penetration has increased across all of our selling channels in both Burke (ph) and Cindy's organizations. As we look to 2005, our private brand efforts will continue to grow. New products will be developed that expand our reach both within categories and into new categories. We'll also position our brands to not only offer our customer terrific value and price but in fact our quality will become equivalent to the national brands. In fact we're so confident of the quality and the value of our product, we offer 100% product guarantee satisfaction on every product that we sell. We're able to do this due to the exhaustive testing that every product that we offer through private brand, the testing that's strung by an independent third party. Additionally, all of our private brand partners must meet the standards defined in our social accountability program which ensures that the conditions and the factories that we produce our goods meet the ethical and social conditions that we would want to be associated with. As I mentioned, private brand will grow for 2005 and beyond. For 2005, we have a target that's listed up here at 18 to 20%. Obviously that means that the back half of the year has to have us tracking at higher than 20% to be able to blend out at that rate. We believe this is very achievable given that we only offer private brand in about 30% of our subcategories of product that we offer. When you consider the greater margins, the product differentiation from our competition, and the improvement in customer loyalty, we feel very bullish about private brand. Global sourcing will become a more significant contributor to our 2005 financial results as well. Now the program consists of a couple of components. Certainly, there's a direct import part of our private brands where we actually work directly with overseas manufacturers to develop and deliver product to our customers. This is in contrast to working with current branded manufacturers to develop product that they manufacture, and they put our label on. This direct import program will continue to increase for 2005. But additionally, there's another side to our global sourcing which we call global tendering. For 10 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting Office Depot, global tendering is the consolidation of our worldwide purchasing power, specifically its merchants in North America working with the merchants in Europe side by side to leverage our joint efforts in working with the vendor community. This helps us secure the best product at the best price. To date this program has yielded over a 17% reduction in cost of goods sold for the 14 categories that we've addressed. But for 2005, we will address more categories and anticipate further significant savings. Enabling these efforts of both the traditional RFP process as well as web based e-auctions. Both of these will continue to play a role as we move forward. We're very confident of our improved performance in 2005. To achieve this, we have recently implemented a number of organizational changes and I'd like to touch on those now. These have included responsibility consolidations to streamline that accountability, become more focused on our mission, internal promotions and new hires of proven results-oriented executives. These changes will provide us greater skills and improve our execution while increasing our clear accountabilities. A few that Id like to call out. Firstly as I previously mentioned, we have integrated merchandising and marketing with both reporting to me. This aligns the goals of both merchandising and marketing much more so than have been historically. Secondly, we've introduced additional merchandise managers and direct channel managers to provide more coordination of our product categories, focus on the merchandising nuances of our Internet and catalog channels and further focus on flawless execution in our strategy. Thirdly, we've created a merchandise planning team to provide significantly more analytical support capabilities in our category management pricing and our merchandise planning assets. Fourth we've strengthened our marketing research capabilities by bringing in a new person. This has already helped us improve our understanding of our customer. And lastly, what I want to mention for the moment is we've improved our catalog Internet and B2B commerce experience which will help strengthen the knowledge and experience from a merchandising perspective to support Cindy's business. I mentioned earlier the need to balance the art and science of retail. This year we've invested heavily in the so called science part which allows us to make more fact based decisions. Mark Holifield will discuss the Magellan project in a few moments and that really is the backbone of a lot of these changes. So let me call out a few improved capabilities, some already supported by Magellan. Firstly, we've improved the research capabilities; I mentioned we've added someone new to lead that area. With improved capabilities within that area so we can better understand who our customer is, it's something much more granular than just the demographic level. We understand better what customer groups are worth, what share of wallet we own by category and what are their needs and preferences. We've deployed a more sophisticated marketing mix model to improve the effectiveness of our media spend and some of that I spoke to earlier when I referenced the insert effectiveness. Thirdly, we've improved the analytical skills to support merchandising, strategic and tactical decisions. Things like how effective is my assortment plan, what vendors, what price points, what classifications are really driving my sales? Are they driving our profits? And lastly we have created a fact based approach to support our pricing strategy. How competitive is the marketplace, how does this allow with the category role of the item? What are the items that must be priced aggressively, what are the items that we can maximize our gross margin? These analytical capabilities along with others that I haven't mentioned are critical for us to achieve our success for 2005. They're critical for us to listen to what the customer is telling us. They are also critical so that we don't base our decisions purely on the art or the intuition which we did too frequently. To sustain our improvement, to execute better, leverage for technology as Magellan, and lower our overall G&A, we've developed and deployed a number of new processes. 11 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting These processes are standardized and formalized, they're analytically driven and they're score carded to ensure that were performing as we said for all these disciplines for Office Depot. Some of the examples that we pursued are listed on the screen and Mark Holifield will speak to those in a few moments. Now more than ever we are improving these processes. They are essential for us as I mentioned to improve our performance in '05 and to sustain that long-term. They're critical for us to improve our sales and margins, reduce our G&A and maintain better in-stock positions. So in summary, I've talked about a number of things around our strategy. Our focus on the core customer, a further refinement of our brand positioning, targeting our product mix to key customer segments and building our private brand. These strategies in themselves are not going to grow our business. They are the enablers that will allow us to execute this with an integral organization, integrated organization, more efficient and effective processes and the analytical rigor to make the best decision each time we select a product, target a customer or make an offer. The results will manifest themselves in a more intense focus on the target customer, increased merchandising and marketing effectiveness, improved sales and margin, more consistent execution and lower G&A. Thank you very much for listening this morning and I think I'll be able to take a couple of questions. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Unidentified Participant I have two questions. The first one, a lot of retailers had a tough time with back- to-school school and can you maybe address some of the shortfalls they might have had, was that a merchandising issue, weather. And then second, I don't know if you saw the article, the New York Times yesterday on Wal Mart and their detail of marketing expertise. And if you didn't, they can pretty much tell what you should sell in the store right before a hurricane, et cetera, et cetera. Your new software, given the people, the systems you have, can you get to that kind of granularity, and how long would it take you to get there? Chuck Rubin - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, Marketing & Merchandizing Let me take that one first. I did not read the article so I cannot comment on that. As far as our abilities in marketing, first of all, we have a little experience with hurricanes in Florida so I didn't see the article but I have some of the experience as to a store organization sitting in the front here. We have, marketing, the old joke about marketing is that you know that half of your spend works, you're just not quite sure which half. We have become over this past year far, far more analytical in determining, projecting performance. What the right items are, what the right price points are, by leveraging historical information. So we have dramatically improved and as many retailers are attempting to do we have made huge strides forward. In fact our insert productivity, again, our largest chunk of our media spend has improved dramatically. Now there's always the risk because there's always new products. And without some historical baseline, that's where you have to skew the pendulum a little bit more towards the art side of retail as opposed to the science. But because so much of our business is commodity oriented, we do have lots of history, and we're able to filter through that pretty extensively so we've made very good strides. As far as back-to-school is concerned, back-to-school in fact was disappointing. I think it was disappointing for most retailers. 12 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting We saw it pick up towards the back end as you got closer to school opening and we have, given our national distribution of scores, excluding mostly the Northeast, we saw then a pretty consistent trend towards improvement, very close to the opening. We had difficulty as many did with certain product classifications. Texas Instruments calculators for instance, which typically are big drivers of volume were disappointing for us and others. We had some challenges on some of our novelty products. So we were disappointed with it, we were disappointed with the traffic. Misery loves a little bit of company but in this case not all that much. I'm pleased to say that we were able to move through inventory, the liability inventory, the lifecycle-based inventory efficiently and without any significant negative impact to our performance, to our bottom line performance. Unidentified Participant (off mic) Can you hear me now? I'm going to try to tie a couple little things that you said together. Number one you said you've increased your investment in technology, you think that's the right thing to do and you're going to continue to do that. Number two, you said that your supplies business has been weak for the last year. And you thought that was primarily an execution issue. But do you think that in some areas you were trying to compensate for the margin deterioration in technology by keeping supplies prices too high? You think that's why you lost some business in that and do you think you need to be more competitive on pricing, particularly in supplies? Thanks. Chuck Rubin - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, Marketing & Merchandizing Let me clarify one point. We made some investments in technology for 2004. We believe that the level of investment, financial investment, will diminish in 2005. We've gotten technology to the place from a capital standpoint that we believe it needed to be. So that would diminish in 2005. I don't, for instance, see any further remerchandising to be done. The supplies component, the pricing initiatives that we put in place generally, I don't believe that has had a negative impact on our top line performance in supplies. Most of the pricing changes that we put through we actually test and control on. And we determine whether there's any impact to top line revenue. And where there is, we don't go forward with the increase in price but where there isn't, then we pursue that. So generally I don't think that's really what drove our supplies shortfall. I think what did drive it is that there were issues that we had. We complicated a business such to the point that customers were at times, I think, frustrated. Frustrated in terms of offering an assortment that was too broad potentially with too many choices, too many vendors, too many SKUs. In other cases, it was an assortment that was difficult to shop. If you talk about our retail stores, there was a plan-o-gram that just wasn't quite as intuitive from a customer's perspective. And hence it may have been somewhat frustrating. Weve had a number of other operational execution issues, where we had not as a smooth a process as is in place right now. When you combine all of them, I don't think there's a single silver bullet, but when you combine all of them, I think it materialized into a supplies business that just didn't live up to what we have to have it live up to. Right now, where we stand is over the past couple of months actually we've made pretty good progress working jointly between, let's just focus on stores for a second. Between the stores operations group, the inventory management group and the merchandising and marketing group really trying to streamline some of these processes. Supplies, all product categories will benefit. Supplies should benefit the most. 13 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting Unidentified Participant Chuck, if you could speak a little bit about the relationship as your first bullet point of focusing on your target customer to your (inaudible) advantage program, the 1.9 million customers. You've got that chart, it looked like 58% of your sales out of the advantage program are from business customers. But you have talked earlier about 90% plus of your current or global customers who want to be from the business side. So is that a disconnect, am I reading it wrong, or where do you want that advantage program to go? Chuck Rubin - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, Marketing & Merchandizing The earlier slide shows that roughly 90% of our current customer base is business customers. I think as we move forward and following the question correctly, the target customer, we have a variety of target customers. We welcome consumers shopping in our stores as well. They generate good traffic and they can generate volume for us. In terms of resource allocation, whether that's media spend, whether that's product uniqueness, whether that's just focus of the merchandising and marketing group, that has to get reallocated in a more defined way than it has been and that reallocation is more towards the business customer. The advantage program we believe is one effort to really address that, 60% of that customer base right now has been defined as business customers. There are futures that are made on top of that as well. Consumers are a portion of the advantage program. They're not the most attractive component because they shop less frequently. We think that as this year transpires, 2005 that is, we'll continue to add members, it will continue to become skewed more towards business customers and we will continue to market more specifically to them with offers that are developed specifically around them. Unidentified Participant And just for a definition, how are you classifying SOHO customers, the small office, home office customers? Are they business or personal? Chuck Rubin - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, Marketing & Merchandizing Business. Unidentified Participant Can you elaborate on the private label program, because I guess my observation would be it's pretty easy to do what private label programs asked but it's hard to do a private label program well such that you actually differentiate the products and brand them for Office Depot. So how are you going about that? Chuck Rubin - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, Marketing & Merchandizing Well, first of all I have Wilson Zhu. So I bought Wilson Zhu. Private brand is an area when I came to the company, the company had already started the process of investing in private brand. Wilson was here and it already started to assemble a pretty impressive array of partners to support our effort. You're right, private brand, it's easy to develop, but it's also very hard to make it quality and sustain it. We believe we've already got a terrific foundation in this. So we've got an organizational structure that's in place. We have a quality assurance program, we have a social accountability component that's already in place and performing very well. 14 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting So we've got the foundation that's laid. When you look at the product that we actually offer out there, we think that we have leapfrogged our competition in terms of what we're doing. Christopher Lowell furniture is a private brand that we work in tandem with Christopher Lowell, he's an interior designer of some note that the television show and column, et cetera, for those of you who don't know him. That furniture is a private brand that we believe is a shining star in our assortment compared to what others carry. It's fashionable, it's great value, it's very functional. We also have developed a line of writing instruments under the Foray label, which we believe is attractive for the customer but also attractive financially for us. As we go forward, you'll see us leverage those labels. You'll especially see us leverage the Office Depot label. And underlying all of our effort is this belief that it has to be quality. If we're willing to stand behind it, there has to be the quality built into it. So we feel pretty confident about where we're headed. We haven't, this is not an overnight expansion that we're pursuing. If we're not as sensitive to building the quality in, we could probably pump that private label penetration up even higher on a faster basis, but that's not the healthy way to do it. This is and will continue to be one of the core foundations of Office Depot for years to come. So we believe that we're doing it in a controlled fashion, we're very solid partners and very, very comfortable with where we are. Just as a point of reference, I mentioned it last night to a couple of people, we're going to end up at 15% penetration for the year this year, 2004, we're already tracking obviously higher than that 15% on a monthly basis for us to blend out for the year at that. So, private brand is a marathon, it's not a sprint. We're going about it, training and putting it in place the right way. Unidentified Participant Couple questions for you. First, when I met with you earlier this summer you had suggested, this Dan Binder, you had suggested that the merchandising team was probably a little bit weak and you were making continuous efforts to try to strengthen that. I'm just curious, given some of the additions you've made, how do you feel about the team today. Are there additional spots open? That's the first question, the second question was, you had mentioned that the supplies business had a very broad offering. Is there actually an opportunity to consolidate vendors in that space? Is that part of it? Or is it something where you just editing SKUs with existing vendors? Chuck Rubin - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, Marketing & Merchandizing Lets address the first question on the team, I mentioned a couple of changes. We are very comfortable with where the team is. I think we need to continue to strengthen the team we have on the ground and then maybe a selective addition that we need to make, but I think the team is significantly strengthened from when we talked a number of months ago. I just brought in a new VP of Merchandising who will be overseeing supplies with extensive Internet, catalogue and B2B sales experience, so he  a guy by the name of Scott Koerner - he's a very engaging guy who I have high confidence in. The addition of divisional merchandise managers also strengthens our ability to execute. Understand that we are a very flat organization and while I am supportive of a flat organization, we were struggling with the balance of both execution and strategy. And by adding in this divisional merchandise managerial level, who, we will have both recruited internally and promoted internally, as well as going outside to strengthen the team, it balances our ability to execute better while the vice presidents in merchandising are able to move their sightline up a little bit and stay focused on the longer-term business. So we feel very good about that. And finally from an organizational standpoint, we have strengthened our talent, both from Scott, who I mentioned, as well as the direct channel managers, strengthened the talent on the direct side of the business, which supports Cindys business. This is an area that over the past couple of years, it appears as though we have been somewhat weak. There are nuances to the Internet and catalogue and contract business that we weren't attending to as well as we could have. 15 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting And we've now strengthened that, so I feel pretty good. As far as the broad offering that you mentioned, is there opportunity to consolidate vendors? Yes, there are. I mentioned to some people last night that I hosted a vendor conference, the first one in years at Office Depot, last week. In fact, many of the speakers today also spoke at that conference. We hosted 90 of our top vendors and outlined where we were going for 2005, and laid out some specific challenges. That, in fact, was one of the challenges. There will not be spaces for every vendor that we do business with today going forward and that means that some vendors will prosper and others will suffer. Today we have sometimes the same product offered through different vendors, between the different channels that we distribute through, so there's an opportunity for that alone. And then when you layer in the things that I mentioned earlier, and talked in more depth about last night, we have assortments that probably are just at times too broad. I think too confusing for our customer. If you walk in, especially supplies where it is commodity oriented, I think sometimes the breadth of our assortment of vendors and even SKUs is broader than it needs to be and hence, is a little more confusing for the customer. Unidentified Participant Just one last question. If you could just comment on where we should see the private label brand increasing? You mentioned that over 30% of the subcategories offer it today, correct? Chuck Rubin - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, Marketing & Merchandizing Well, I think that's - I mentioned you'll see it both deepen and broaden, so the classifications of product that we offer today will get deeper and there will be more classifications. Paper is probably worth noting. Paper is a large private brand classification today, I don't see that expanding much in 2005. So the expansion that we have will be in non-paper categories. That in turn is an interesting point because paper, if you look at it from a margin standpoint, paper is the most conservative margin opportunity, if you will, for private brand. It's everything else that's more effective from a margin standpoint and we look at 2005, the expansion potential in private brand is in pretty much everything outside of paper, since we've tapped that one so deeply already. Unidentified Participant A question on the assortment changes. I'm just trying to think of how you're thinking about this longer term. You have 8,000 SKUs in your stores. I'm just trying to picture it. How many SKUs do you think you're going to reduce there? And then is it a strategy youll be offering one type of product per category, or would you offer a good, better, best? Or is it an initiative where you want to drive gross margins there by directing your customers' purchase actions towards a higher gross margin product? Chuck Rubin - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, Marketing & Merchandizing Well, certainly one of the goals is to try to optimize the margin and by positioning products, you can do that. I don't think that would make it as black and white as you're describing. I don't think that the goal is to offer one line of product across the store for each classification of product. 16 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting I think there's a different implementation of this based on the product category, but overall, the strategy is to make the assortment easier to shop for the customer. We have certain classifications of product today that you'll see over the next number of months. We'll start to clean up, if you will, that we offer an assortment that is more confusing than it should be. Now there's other assortments quite frankly we may need to add in some SKUs. So I don't see the 8,000 SKU count for our retail stores changing dramatically. Its the allocation of that SKU count that you may see shift a little bit. You also might see, and I think I mentioned this, you also might see that the SKU count doesn't change, it's the vendor mix that changes. We may carry 3 or 4 vendors in a classification of product today, but tomorrow, it could be 2 vendors. There's, we believe, clarity for the customer in that, and we also believe from a financial point of view that there's an opportunity for us to leverage that better. Unidentified Participant There's been a question on technology merchandising. I don't know if John Lostroscio is here today or not, but if you can give us an update as to where you stand on the cleanliness of the PC inventory? I know it was up quite dramatically from where it was a year, 2 years ago? And what the objective were and the follow up, also, on the consumer versus business mix, I think you spoke a little bit about the notebooks versus desktops (inaudible), but can you tell us how the I-Pod, I think you're carrying those in your stores, how that fits into the mix? Chuck Rubin - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, Marketing & Merchandizing John is not here today. He actually had commitments to help run our business down in Delray Beach, so he stayed back home. As far as the cleanliness of our inventory, as I mentioned, we're very, very pleased with that. It's really supported by two key things that bear repeating. One is Paul Larkin, who heads up our inventory management. He's done a terrific job of controlling our inventory flow of product and technology. The second thing that they've been able to leverage, along with merchandising, is the CTO offering that we have. It's configured to order capability, which is unique in our channels of distribution. Our vendors, even those vendors who aren't available on the CTO , give us huge kudos for this. In essence, what we've been able to do is for inventory that's offered for sale at retail, we are able to control the inventory flow of that and as we lower that inventory, waiting for new introductions of product, we are able to fill that gap with the CTO offering, which is a virtual inventory offering. So the customer doesn't walk out of the store that day with the CTO purchase with the product in hand, it gets delivered to them in a few days and it's allowed us to really manage that inventory and truly, truly control the risk that we have in that end of life inventory. As far as the - second question was, I'm sorry, consumer business technology? Oh, the I-Pod, that's right. The I-Pod, we carry an HP I-Pod or the H-Pod as it's called at retail. We carry the Apple I-Pod online. We are, as most people, excluding Comp USA I think, we do not sell Apple directly in stores today. The H-Pod model is doing OK. It's in a somewhat limited distribution based on quantity. How does that fit in with consumer versus business? We think that when we define our business customer usage, that applies to things that they would use in the course of conducting business, whether that's a briefcase to carry a notebook and their essentials or whether it's an I-Pod that they may carry while they're traveling on business in airports, which many of us do consistently. What you will see us curb back on  actually, in fact we really  I should reword that. What we won't be getting into, are things that you're seeing some of our competition do with clearly oriented-licensed product that is clearly consumer oriented. We believe things like the I-Pod have a niche to fill for our business customer. I think that I'm getting the sign to wrap up. So with that, I appreciate everyone's interest and support and I will introduce my partner in inventory management, Mark Holifield. 17 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting PRESENTATION Mark Holifield - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, Supply Chain Thank you Chuck. Good morning everyone. Thank you for coming to our meeting today and thank you for your interest in Office Depot. Before I get too far , I'd like to introduce some key people in the supply chain team and the Magellan team. First, I'd like to introduce Dennis Andruskiewicz. He's our Senior Vice President of Distribution and has been with Office Depot for 5 years. I'm going to spend some time talking with you today about some success we've enjoyed on distribution over the years. Dennis is one of the key reasons that success has happened. I'd also like to introduce Paul Larkin. Paul is Vice President of Inventory Management. Paul has been with Office Depot for 6 years, started in inventory management with us, moved out in the field working in distribution, and thought he'd come back and run our inventory again, and he's doing a great job of that. I'll show you some great results in inventory management as well. I'd like to introduce Carol Martin. Carol is Vice President of Merchandising currently on assignment with the Magellan project. Carol has been with Office Depot for 10 years in a variety of merchant roles and is doing a great job with the Magellan program as well. If you take anything away from my presentation today, what Id like it to be is this; that everything we're doing as to supply chain and with the Magellan program, it's all about North American retail profitable growth, and it's all about North American delivery profitable growth. I'm going to spend some time talking about supply chain.. I'm going to spend some time talking about Magellan. First, our supply chain focuses on 4 key areas. It's pretty simple. It's 101. Customer service is the first, foremost and most important focus for our supply chain. Nothing else matters if we are not in stock for the customer at the shelf in the store. Nothing else matters if we don't fill the order on time and complete or have the product in our warehouse ready to go when the customer calls. Nothing else matters if we are not on time and complete with that delivery at the customer delivery point. So customer service is the first and foremost focus area for the supply chain. At the same time, we want to manage our inventory very carefully. Our second focus is in inventory productivity. We want to make sure that we can contribute to the company's cash flow appropriately, make sure that we're getting a good return on our investment in inventory. Third, our total supply chain costs. That includes distribution costs, but that also includes costs downstream in the supply chain at the store and back upstream with the vendor. The fourth area, critically important, is responsiveness. I'm going to talk a little bit about how we measure our responsiveness at Office Depot and how we look at our supply chain as critical responses where it's important to our business. About a year ago, we reorganized our supply chain operation. First, we consolidated our existing operation under Dennis. Before, the distribution organization reported up to the business units. We had retail distribution and we had BSG distribution, separate buildings, separate inventories, separate management. So we consolidated that so that we could unlock synergy. We also consolidated inventory management in the pricing group. We thought that it was important to bring a single focus for product flow and information flow, so that we could better manage our inventory, our in-stock position and our cost structure. Let's set the table with a picture of our distribution network. There's 10 Crossdocks in our network. Those are the blue diamonds on the map. You can see that they are disbursed throughout the U.S. These are what we use to support our retail stores. You will note there's a blue diamond up there in Northeastern Pennsylvania, so we are well positioned to support our Northeastern growth strategy on stores. The red squares represent our CSCs, the customer service centers, they support 18 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting the delivery business. These support our delivery customers. That's where we store the 14,000 SKUs and respond to customer orders throughout the U.S. So as you can see, we're well positioned in the Northeast there as well. Nothing new. Our Boston facility, Connecticut facility, Philadelphia, Baltimore and our Northeastern Crossdock have all been there operating for quite some time. So were very well positioned for our growth strategies there. Let's go to our first area of focus in the supply chain, the customer service. Our service metrics are strong. Our retail stores must be in-stock when the customer comes in, to get the product. It must be on the shelf. Our retail in-stock levels are at 99% and we measure that 2 different ways. We measure it that with our perpetual inventory system, where we identify what is in the inventory of the store on the perpetual inventory. And then we also have store people walk the store every day, scanning every hole , every out , or every load in the store so that we can replenish that slot. And thus our retail in-stock levels, are at 99%. Our BSG filtrate, that is, the filtrate for delivery orders, is better than 99%. That means when a customer calls and requests an item from us, it's inside our warehouse and we're able to fill that order. Our on-time delivery, down at the customer level, taking those orders and delivering them, we're also at 99% there. Those are good numbers. We are happy with those, but we constantly strive to improve them and we will continue to do that. Let's talk about that second area of the supply chain focus, inventory management. As you may know, we've got a constant focus on inventory productivity at Office Depot and that's led to continuously improving results. Were really quite pleased with this, and pleased to see record results in this area. We continue to make excellent progress, combining inventory management and the supply chain together to help us to be more responsive and drive these types of results. Let's take a look at inventory turnover another way. We benchmark ourselves against others. We do that so that we can measure how we're doing and identify areas for improvement. As you can see, in this dimension, we compared very favorably with other retailers and distributors. Now, everybody knows that different product types, delivery mix, a whole bunch of other factors can impact these numbers, but we believe that these numbers are valid to compare as these are the groups we're often compared to and the numbers speak for themselves. We similarly benchmark gross margin return on investment and inventory yields and the picture there is quite similar. Back to those 4 key areas, the third I talked of was total supply chain costs. Lets talk first about our retail distribution costs. These numbers reflect the indexed cost of operating all aspects of that 10 Crossdock network that supports stores. That includes labor, depreciation of equipment, transportation, and all that goes in to getting product to our stores from our Crossdocks and through our Crossdocks. As you know, this is a labor intensive business, over the years, there have been a number of increases in health and welfare costs, yet we continue to make improvements. There have also been increases in fuel costs. We continue to make improvements there. By the way, we didn't do this while sacrificing internal service to our stores. Our accuracy rates in stores and our on-time rates in stores are the best they've ever been. Let's look at the delivery side of the business. This is the BSG distribution cost. They have declined as well over the years. Again, indexed costs, all the costs of operating our warehouse network, our 22 warehouses, all the costs of distribution and transportation are in this, labor, rent, depreciation, supplies . Particularly of note here is we've taken out about $150 million in cumulative cost savings over the past 3 years, a very meaningful impact on our EPS results. Over this period of time, all of our customer service trends have been positive. So how do we (inaudible) some of that? One way we did it was optimizing our modes of delivery. Starting in 2002, we took a very hard look at the way we were managing transportation for delivery. In the past, we used a one-size-fits-all approach for the most part, and that was private fleet. About 80% of our deliveries went through private fleet. Trucks that Office Depot owns and operates and Office Depot drivers. Now the service of that is quite good . You know, having your own trucks on the road, having your own drivers, is a very high service proposition. 19 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting But when you're loading up trucks with only a little bit of product to take over long distances, it doesn't make that much sense. This is particularly true considering the advances the parcel carriers have made, UPS and FedEx, in time-definite delivery and improving their tracking and quality capabilities. We also found that dedicated contract carriage was a good solution, so here are the things we did. We first took the one-package orders or the two-package orders, the ones that it didn't make sense to stock our private fleet truck and make delivery and we tendered those to UPS. Secondly, we took high cost markets such as New York City and Detroit, we partnered with dedicated third parties. These are companies that operate dedicated fleets, oftentimes with Office Depot delivery vehicles with Office Depot uniformed drivers and make deliveries. They have cost advantages sometimes because of the labor structures that they operate under. They also have delivery management expertise and they also can manage trucks very well. Finally, we took small markets and outsourced those to third party where we have less than 5 routes. Small markets, things like Oklahoma City, places like that, where you don't get economies of scale, by partnering with a third party will have those economies of scale. You can lower your overall cost. So our index transportation cost has come down as well. So where does this take us on mode mix. For 2002, as I said we were about 80% private fleet, with some business going to parcel, third parties and LTL. In 2004, we've taken the mix to about 40% Office Depot private fleet , about 30% with dedicated third parties, and the rest with parcel carriers and LTL . This shift has been key for the cost directions in BSG deliveries that I showed earlier. Now you don't make shifts like this without imposing some disruption on your business. No doubt some pain occurred out there in the delivery markets, but what I will tell you is that that pain is likely behind us. The Office Depot fleet, the third-party dedicated carriers and the parcel carriers are all performing at 99% on time, or better at this point. So all that , including our inventory carrying costs, here's the picture of distribution and supply chain costs at Office Depot. The first thing I talked about in supply chain is responsiveness. We attribute that responsiveness to a couple of key areas. First, fast transit time. As I indicated before, we operate 10 Crossdocks around the United States. Instead of putting up mega warehouses in 4 or 5 locations, we decided that we would put these 10 low inventory, low fixed cost facilities out there, close to our customer. 86% of our North American stores receive at least 5 day-a-week deliveries. Only one pair of our stores is receiving 6 day-a-week deliveries. This allows us to be responsive to fast-moving trends in stores, allows us to be better in stock, and allows us to improve our inventory productivity while we do that. The average driving time from Crossdocks to North American stores is less than 4 hours. We believe that a distribution network that is hours away is far better than one that's days away. We also focus on a high velocity of inventory. We use flow through distribution for about 80% of our flow of goods and about 20% in traditional warehousing for the retail channel. We use a distant time allocation at the Crossdocks and that results in warehouse-like service at a much lower cost. Let me tell you a little bit about how this works at the Crossdocks. Currently we have 10 Crossdocks serving about 923 stores. When we go to make an order to the vendor, we look at all 92 stores or so that will serve our Crossdock . We roll up the demand, support that demand from all those stores, we look at the inventory position in that store, we identify the safety stock for that store, we identify the space - the plan-o-gram minimum, so that we look good in the store as well. We roll all of that up to a forecasted demand at the Crossdock level. We take that order to the vendor for a bulk order destined for the Crossdock. Note that that's not store-ready orders, that's in fact the bulk order to the Crossdock. Whenever an order arrives at the Crossdock some days later, we scan a UCC 128 bar code, that links up to an advance ship notice that the vendor sends to us via EDI. That tells us everything that is on that 20 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting pallet and allows us to distribute that pallet - redistribute that pallet based upon what is happening in stores now; based on today's forecast, based on today's inventory position. We then take that product directly to the store outbound lane. It gets loaded on the truck and it's down the road for delivery for the next day. These facilities, as you can see, there's not a lot of capital investment in there. There's not a lot of inventory in there. That keeps our costs very low. In comparison to warehousing, where you bring products in, you receive it, you put it away, then you replenish it to a picking slot, then you go pick it, then you bring it out and the you send it down the road in a truck, there's far more steps in that than in the Crossdocking flow through process. But because we do that last-minute allocation, we gain the benefit of warehouse-like service. Now that's not to say that flow through is the right strategy for every SKU, because it's not. As I said, about 20% of the space is devoted to traditional warehousing. That allows us to hold upstream , high scarcity products, high value products, things like the I-Pod , where we can hold those in inventory. If we sell one of those in the store, up to 4 or 5 per day, we'll have that in the store tomorrow. We do believe that that gives us the most responsive supply chain in the business. And we've not stopped learning in this area. We're continuing to improve along the way. As I mentioned before, the distribution units reported into respective business units retail and delivery. Now, as part of the single supply chain strategy, we can unlock synergy and gain leverage. We have those inventories that were separate across the channels. We can now leverage those inventory tools by eliminating the barriers across the channels. There are a number of examples here on how we're getting that synergy. The Crossdocks now serve delivery customers. Instead of duplicating technology inventory in those 22 customer service centers that serve customers with direct delivery, we're holding that inventory at the Crossdock and fulfilling orders from there. Our delivery customer service centers are now serving retail customers, both in shipping product to stores and shipping product directly to retail customers when its ordered. There's further benefits as well, leveraging our inbound freight, using our delivery fleet to deliver to stores, leveraging space, people, support and management further. So where do we go from here on the supply chain? Well, we're not done. We're focused on continuous improvement here. Our execution is still not flawless. We always have room for improvement. Our focus would be to continue our stocks where it improves customer service metrics. We know that that is the most critical item in our supply chain focus. What our customers will see from this is improved in-stock, improved fillrates and improved delivery service. And that brings us to the Magellan program. Now some of you may be familiar with this background based on previous meetings and information, but let me restate the rationale for this initiative. Back in the day when Office Depot was a single channel retailer, it was really quite simple, stamping out large-scale office product super stores across the landscape with a single assortment was pretty easy. It didn't require a lot of sophisticated systems. Add to that multiple store formats, add to that multiple channels, add to that multiple brands, and pretty soon, you realize you've got to have an improved system to handle that. We also lacked the analytical capability that we needed to help drive intelligent merchandising. Now how did we get that? Well, our choices were to continue to enhance our in-house systems, develop new ones in-house, or pick a leading retailing system. We chose to implement leading solutions from Retek and from AC Nielsen. We picked Retek because it's the most functionally rich retailing system out there that operates on technology that's state-of-the-art. It's scalable for our business and it has proven success with other clients. We also believe that it led to an overall lower total cost of ownership, and therefore, improved our investment ROI . In the past, we had no merchandise planning system. We had no assortment planning system. All this was done in an ad hoc manner. 21 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting To drive the merchandising that Chuck wants to drive, these types of systems are absolutely critical. So what are our objectives here? First, to improve our sales and margin through more effective store space utilization. That means, improving our store layouts, making sure that our stores are laid out productively with appropriate mix for supplies, furniture, and technology based upon the earned space. Secondly, laying out stores correctly at the shelf level, making sure that we optimize the use of the shelf space to drive margin and customer satisfaction. Secondly, we want to continue to improve our in stock position through improved forecasting. Improving sales and margin through improved assortments and merchandise plans. We want to make sure that we have the correct analytics to allow us to plan our assortments better and to track our merchandising performance. Finally, improving our sales and margin for better pricing, decision making and data integrity. Our legacy proves that we haven't had the flexibility to deal with the type of challenges we're faced with today. So here's what weve done with Magellan. At this point, we have 9 tracks of functionality live. The overall program is pretty much on target, delivering the functionality we said we would deliver, when we said we would deliver it, for the cost that we originally estimated. Now, these types of programs, as you well know from looking at our company, have a fair amount of risk with them. We're managing risk very carefully. Too many companies have been bit on this. The road to supply chain hell was paved with failed ERP implementations and implementations that just haven't gone right. We've been very cautious. We've assembled a dedicated team both IT and business, we've got the right people. We chose the right software platform in Retek. We chose the right integrator, the one with the most experience in implementing Retek. We've been very cautious along the way. We've passed through four levels of testing in each implementation that we do, and we broke out the implementation into phases, so there was no big bang, no high risk. So, what are these phases that we've laid out? First, we use Retek's inventory optimization module, helped us to improve our inventory by managing the parameters that we manage our inventory with in our existing systems. Secondly, we implemented Retek demand forecasting. This improves our overall forecast accuracy, improving our in-stock position at stores while keeping our inventory turns good. We implemented Merchandise financial planning, Retek's Top Plan product. This gives you a tool to take the overall business plans and lay it out by category down to the sub-class level, allowing you to plan your business and hold merchants accountable for their sales, margin and inventory forecast and actual performance. We implemented Retek's merchandising system, which includes foundation data. There's not much really sexy about that. It's really about item data, location data, and things like that. But with improved item data, with things like product attributes, things like good/better/best relationships, we can manage our assortments much better. We also implemented Retek's pricing. That allows us to manage store zones better, it allows us to manage relationships between SKUs better, such as good/better/best, such as the red/yellow/green pin, making sure that we price those accurately across, and that will improve our margins. AC Nielsen Space Plan gives us the plan-o-gramming tools we need to lay out the product on the shelf properly, and to do improved store design. So, that's where we've been. All of those are in place now, and moving forward. Here's where we're going. First, merchandising data warehouse, Retek Data Warehouse. That module actually went live on Thursday, so this slide is just out of date. That's another on-time, on-budget Magellan delivery with the functionality we said we would deliver. What Merchandising Data Warehouse gives us is the capability for the scorecards that Chuck talked of, which allows Chuck to drive his merchants toward a consistent, analytical approach to managing assortments and merchandising. Our Retek merchandising system tracks with inventory and purchase order management and allocation, will help us further improve our inventory management, plus provide better integration of our inventory systems with the Retek tools. Merchandise Financial Planning Top Plan wave two 22 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting will further improve the capability of Top Plan to handle all of our channels. And last, Assortment Planning, Retek's assortment optimization tool, will help us to provide better assortments in the stores and throughout the company. I talked a lot about systems, but Magellan is not just systems. It is really about retailing process, as well. We've had some key process wins here. First, a new merchandise financial planning process. This allows that sales, margin and inventory accountability and performance management that Chuck needs to drive the merchant organization. This will improve our execution through better merchandise plans. The new assortment planning process is now in place, before Retek's optimization tool. We put this in place first so that we could start to gain benefit as quickly as possible. This ensures a more analytical approach to managing assortments, and includes cross-functional review with store operations, replenishment, space planning folks and merchants to ensure that we're being most effective with our new assortments. We've got a new plan-o-gram submission process, which eliminates errors in the process, and we've got new training for merchants, which includes strategy development, program negotiation, and category management. So, with combination of good systems and good process, we believe that Magellan will deliver the benefits promised. We're on track to deliver benefits in the range that we originally expected once systems and processes are fully vetted in. The sales and margin numbers here reflect the estimated 12-month run rate, with expected benefits once we're fully implemented. The inventory reduction is a one-time reduction. These numbers are the same as we presented in New York in October 2003. So, giving you a high-level view of the supply chain and Magellan, I guess our four key supply chain objectives. We've had a clear track record of success. We possess a customer service focus. We will continue to improve our in-stock in stores, our fillrates in our warehouses, and our on-time delivery. We've demonstrated inventory efficiency leadership. We'll continue on this path, again using inventories to drive profitable growth. We have an excellent track record of reducing costs. We'll continue that. By reorganizing the supply chain, we're now leveraging supply chain skills and infrastructure among the channels for continued improvement. And lastly, the Magellan program is on track, on budget, on time. At this point, I'd be happy to answer any questions or -- about Magellan or the supply chain. Thanks very much for your interest. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Unidentified Participant Mark, obviously Retek and Magellan are doing a lot of things a little bit better along the way, but where do you think you are in terms of the 35 to 65 basis points of improvement? How much of that do you think you're already realizing with the modules that are in place, and how much of that is to come as you put the assortment planning modules in place? And then, as the risk side of that, maybe if you could characterize -- obviously, you're doing a very good job implementing it on time, on budget and as planned, but characterize where you are in terms of the risks of something going wrong at this point versus what you've already kind of got behind you and in place. Mark Holifield - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, Supply Chain Right. Regarding the margin, in 2004 we probably gained a little bit. As you could tell from the slides, those tracks went live mostly during 2004. In our business case and in our actual results, we've seen a ramp-up period of time before people can really get to the results. In 2005, we'd expect probably a little bit less than half of those margin and sales improvements, and those are in our plans already. As far as risk goes, we manage risk very carefully. We've got -- as I said before, we've got a key leadership team, people from Accenture who have helped us to implement this. They're the most experienced Retek integrator out there. Retek, we've got a great team from Retek, and we've got a great team in our IT group and in the business group. We also have internal audit involved, helping us to do risk brainstorming with every go-live that we do. That helps us to plan for the worst, expect the worst, and then go forward. So, we have back-out strategies, we have all kinds of capabilities to manage risk. 23 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting Yes, there is risk still in front of us. I mean, when you are taking the perpetual inventory of a company and moving it from one system to another, that is not a risk-free proposition. But we're managing risk extremely carefully. We're reviewing the project with the Audit Committee, the Finance Committee, and with others. We have a Steering Committee that includes the top leadership here with us. And each time, we go through a risk assessment, where we are with the program. Unidentified Participant Mark, just a couple questions. First of all, given that your in-stock is quite high, and seems like that's probably not the biggest opportunity, could you give us a tangible sense, or a tangible example, of a kind of change you'd make in mix or assortment in a given store or a given market, based on your findings from Retek and the Magellan program? And secondly, as you look at the 35 to 65 basis points of margin, how much of that comes from lower markdowns, and what are the line items within growth that should drive that expansion? Mark Holifield - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, Supply Chain Right. Some of the tangible assortment changes might be simply tailoring the assortment to the size of the store. This gives us the capability to manage several levels of plan-o-grams, several sizes of plan-o-grams, allows us to identify which SKUs do we need to come out -- need to pull out of the assortment when we go to a smaller store, like a downtown store, or something. So, it identifies which are the SKUs that are most productive and which are the least productive, and gives us that capability. As far as the margin benefit, there's benefit both in markdowns and in vendor negotiation and in pricing, so there are a number of different line items that impact the margin. Pricing is a margin improvement. The Retek Data Warehouse, the information on each SKU is an improvement -- there's an improvement baked in for that. The inventory management tools, improved forecasting and capability to manage inventory will lower our markdown exposure, so there are -- there's a little bit of margin in every one of those tracks that I put up, practically. Unidentified Participant Thanks. Mark, can you talk about how your business might be affected by the slowdown at the West Coast ports and what contingency plans you're taking to avoid out-of-stock situations? Mark Holifield - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, Supply Chain Yes. Yes, as you may know, the situation in California this year is bad as it's ever been. Delays have been reported between seven and 10 days landing freight at the dock, and then, once you land it on the dock, there's a backlog of trucking, which leads to sometimes a five to seven days away in getting the freight picked up. This has some impact on our holiday business. Our product does come through the southern California ports. Don't think it's huge, but there is some exposure there. We are making contingency plans. We have expedited freight out of southern California to deal with this. We're also making plans for next year, to figure out how to work around the situation. We've got a number of options outlined that I think will avoid this problem in the future. OK. Sean might have a couple of housekeeping items, and then we'll go to break. Oh, one more question, sorry. Unidentified Participant Yes, just a question with regards to distribution infrastructure. If you could sort of talk to the sort of capacity utilization, particularly in the Northeast facility, will you be able to get a lot of leverage once you start to build more and more stores in the Northeast, or is that going to just require a lot more investment in infrastructure? 24 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting Mark Holifield - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, Supply Chain I think our delivery infrastructure is quite sound up there with Boston, Hartford, Philadelphia and Baltimore. Those facilities, for the most part, are under capacity at this point. The Crossdock can take on a fair number of stores although, at some point, we will need to increase the Crossdock capabilities up there to support the store counts, as planned. The good news about cross docking is, as we said, it's an extremely low capital investment, very low. You saw the building there, that you don't have to put a lot of material handling equipment in that. All you really need is a wide floor space and you can get that done, so it's really quite low in capital commitment. Sean McHugh - Office Depot Inc. - Director, IR OK, I think that's it. We're running a bit behind, but we'll be OK for the rest of the day. We'll take about a 30-minute break, and if everyone could be back here at quarter past eleven, we'll pick up with North American Retail. Thanks. (BREAK) PRESENTATION Sean McHugh - Office Depot Inc. - Director, IR OK, it looks like most everyone is back from the break. I'd like to get us started here and, hopefully, keep us on schedule for the balance of the morning and the afternoon, as well. The next portion of the program is our North American Retail. We've got two speakers today, Rick Lepley and Monica Luechtefeld, and right now, to start, I'd like to introduce Rick Lepley, our EVP of North American Retail. Rick Lepley - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, NA Retail Thank you, Sean. Good morning, everybody. I would like to talk to you this morning about where we are in North American Retail and where we're going. First of all, as I think most of you know, from 2000 through 2003 we ran a string of 15 or 16 consecutive quarters in which we comped down, and we followed that with three consecutive quarters this year of comping up, and I believe the fourth quarter will also show positive comps. Our retail profitability has ranged from a low of 3.3% in the year 2000 to a high of 7.2% in the year 2002 and, through the first three quarters of 2004, retail has contributed 6.6%. For four years, our store count in North America has essentially been flat. We ended 2003 with 900 stores, and that was only 12 more than we had ended the year 2000 with. And we've had a flurry of activity in the past weeks and in the next six weeks, and we'll end this year with a total of 970 stores in North America. At the end of the third quarter, we had a total of 923 stores in North America, 890 stores in 44 states and the District of Columbia, and 33 stores up in Canada. The average size, the average footprint of one of our stores, is 26,000 square feet. The average age is over eight years. In fact, it's about 8-1/2 years. The average store carries about 8,000 SKUs. In the year 2000, we did 142 million transactions. We're supported by a supply chain, as Mark indicated, of 10 Crossdocks in the United States, and we currently employ about 23,000 employees. The reality of Office Depot retail is that we have an older chain of stores in a much larger box than our competitors, and therein I believe lays a terrific opportunity for improvement. With just the new stores that we added in the final -- in the last two weeks and then the final two weeks of this year, we will have averaged -- lowered our average store age to 8.3 years, and dropped store size on the average down to just over 25,000 square feet. In 2005 and 2006, our focus will be on initiatives that drive profitable growth, and there are only two major initiatives in which we're focused, the repositioning of our North American real estate and improvements in operational execution in our stores in North America. We've reorganized 25 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting North American retail to provide for greater accountability, and to get everybody focused on just one thing, and that's improved contribution from our operating units. Let's talk for a moment about repositioning North American real estate. I think that this will be our main focus over the next 24 to 36 months. It is unquestionably our number one priority. We've restructured our existing organization. We have hired Bob Ozburn as Vice President of Real Estate. In fact, Bob would be here today, but he's out interviewing people because we've also added positions of Real Estate Portfolio Managers in North America. We've better aligned the key stakeholders during the selection site, and the way this works, essentially, is that our real estate group has a strategy or a plan for each major metropolitan market. They'll go out and find a space, and they'll take it to the regional Vice President. He'll look at the location. He'll decide what size box he'd like to operate there. If he's in agreement, then they'll bring it into our finance group, and our finance group will run all the numbers. They'll do the demographics. They'll do the pro forma. And if the numbers support the deal, it will then be brought to Real Estate Committee. Real Estate Committee has three members -- myself, Charlie Brown and Bob Ozburn , and our real estate meetings take place monthly, so we look at the whole portfolio not only of new stores coming in, but also all of the leases that are up for renewal 12 months out, sometimes even 18 months out, depending on what the terms of the lease were. So, what we're trying to do is to actually have a plan for every single existing store, to understand when that lease expires in the future, and to decide what it is we want to do with that box. Do we want to make it smaller? Do we want to relocate? Do we want to renew that lease? All of that is part and parcel of the real estate meetings that take place monthly. So, not only are we there to select new sites which have been proposed, but also to review existing sites. All new stores opened in the future will be the M2 format, providing our customers a differentiated shopping experience. And unquestionably, much of our activity will take place, as you know, in the Northeast. I've already told you that we expect to end this year with 970 stores. We expect to add about 100 stores in the year 2005, and about 100 more in 2006. It would be reasonable for one to expect that at least a third of these new store openings would be focused in the Northeast. As I mentioned earlier, our M2 store model is the only model we will introduce going forward. M2 is a highly differentiated and winning proposition. It's got a lower cost to build and a lower cost to operate. It's a customer-preferred shopping experience. The research has been excellent. M2's can run with a lower average inventory. At the same time, our AOV is actually proving to be a little bit higher. The design principles provide for better graphics and color, enhanced store layout, low sightline fixtures, more bulks and fewer peg hooks. We took about 50% of the peg hooks out of a traditional Office Depot store. With M2, we're actually working with the merchants to even try and lower that figure. M2 has labor model efficiencies that, unquestionably, will make it less expensive to operate. In short, as most of you know who came to the M2 introduction, M2 is really designed for women. Our research shows that about 60% of those people shopping our stores are women and, of the other 40%, some percentage, maybe as much of half of it, is influenced by women. So, we wanted lower sightlines. We knew for sure we needed a better and differentiating color palate, since all office supply superstores are red. We also knew we needed better signage, because research showed that two-thirds of shoppers in office supply superstores ask where something is, which told us that we had to do a better job of not only improving the sightline, but improving the signage. And you can see at the bottom that we'll have 110 M2 stores in operation by the end of the year, consisting of 80 new stores, 12 relocations, and I believe that we'll be able to finish 23 remodels. The Northeast is a large, attractive market comprising of nearly one-third of the nation's GDP. We believe that there's a large opportunity for incremental office supply superstore capacity, given that many markets currently host only one competitor. Our Kids 'R Us store acquisition has facilitated our expansion because it gave us access to buildings with the right size footprint in attractive markets, and the portfolio provided meaningful site counts. So, in other words, these will serve as the nucleus around which we can build density in various markets. We plan to open 51 of these locations as Office Depots stores. Now, the question that I received last night most often, I suppose, was what the status of KRU? So, I brought these numbers with me this morning, and I can fill you in on that. We started out with 124 stores in the transaction. Twenty-three stores fell out along the way for various reasons, so that 26 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Of the 101 stores, we're opening 51, and we've sold 17 to PetCo, so we're down to 33. Of the 33, six are already sold. Now we're down to 27. We had seven deals pending right now. We're down to 20. Five of them we have short-term leases on. In other words, the remaining term of the lease is less than 24 months. In some cases, in one that I remember, it's only seven months. So, in all likelihood, we won't be able to dispose of those. We'll just wait them out. And that gets us down to 15 that we still have yet to dispose of. The timing of this expansion and the acquisition of the M2 stores was fortuitous to us -- for us because of the M2 format. These buildings were perfectly formatted for laying out an M2, and that really places us in a better competitive position going into the Northeast versus our plain and simple traditional format. Our second priority, as I mentioned at the outset, is to improve store level execution to increase unit contribution. Contribution from units is the focus of everything we're doing in North American retail; contribution at the store level, at the district level, and at the regional level. We've reorganized North American retail to create greater accountability. We're implementing a targeted selection process for new hired employees. We are revising our employee compensation plans. We've re-instituted mystery shopping at our stores in North America. We are conducting extensive district manager audits monthly, and we've focused resources on improving our under-performing stores. Over the past several months, we've reorganized to drive greater accountability at all levels of our organization. We've appointed new leadership, including George Hill , our new Senior Vice President of Regional Operations. George is here with us this morning. We've appointed three new regional Vice Presidents, and we've appointed a Vice President of Store Operations, Joe Jeffries , who's also here with us this morning. Now, one year ago, an Office Depot district manager had 15 stores. Today, an Office Depot district manager has 10 stores, so we've added nearly 30 district managers in the past nine months. In the past nine months, we've built a sales organization exclusively to support our copy, print and ship initiatives not only at the store, but also in our BSD group. That's comprised of about 35 to 40 individuals, District Managers in the field, as well as a corporate support staff. We formalized a store manager's council that's comprised of our highest performing store managers, also and perhaps not coincidentally the most outspoken, and we're trying to use them to understand what it is we're doing right and wrong and to leverage the best practices that they're using across the whole chain. We've also realigned our Canadian support organization in order to focus on our Canadian stores, and the results so far have been terrific. So, in the future, decisions about Canada will not only be made by people in Canada, but they'll all be Canadians. We won't be making too many decisions down here about marketing or merchandising, except that we'll be trying to satisfy the demands they have for us to help them improve their business and grow their store count. Recently, we implemented a Web-based employee selection and development tool. There are a lot of great retailers utilizing this system. What it does is help you qualify and understand the individual that you're hiring, so that you're certain to higher the right type of person who can grow in a retail environment. And what we know from people who've used this testing in the past -- one of these companies, that is Home Depot, is using something very similar to this -- we know that they get higher customer service scores as a result of using these employees. We know, in fact, that their shrink is lower. We know that employees demonstrate a higher level of commitment to their employer, and we know that they're more productive employees as a result of these tests, and that they're driving higher sales per hour. We're linking compensation to profitability. Of course, payroll is the single largest operating expense line item, so this is obviously our most impactful lever. We've begun to enforce greater pay rate consistency across the chain, and we've gradually been shifting our labor mix between part-time and full-time employees. Our current mix is about 60/40. Our target is 70/30. Though the customer service levels are always a concern, we've been watching that closely and, as we've been making this transition, there's no noticeable change in our customer service levels. So, we're delighted to be able to inform you that customer service levels are not dropping as a result of moving toward this mix. Of course, it's always a concern, and we'll be certain to keep an eye on it. Last week, as you know, we eliminated duplicate positions in lower volume stores. What you may not know is that this represented less than one-half of an employee per store. In addition, our store level bonus program has now been centered around metrics that drive unit contribution at the store level. In the fourth quarter of this year, we are re-instituting a mystery shopper program for all our stores in North America. What that means is that, during 2005, each store will receive 12 mystery shops, and a portion of the store manager's bonus will be tied directly to the mystery shops results. 27 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting In recent months, we've instituted a new and much more detailed district manager audit report. This tool is to be completed on all stores each month. The report ranges from two to six pages depending on the contribution level of the store. The report becomes considerably more detailed and more involved for stores with low or negative profitability. The interesting thing about this is that it's Web-based so, when we go out to travel -- if, for example, we're flying to San Diego to call on stores, we can just go and print all these and take them with us. And as we walk the stores, we can look at the district manager's report and see how the store looks and if, in fact, it agrees with what he has written. Earlier this year, we formed a team to improve profitability across some of our under-performing locations. This program involves dedicated management resources, a complete initial operational diagnostic of the store, and then create an action plan. They target metrics and milestones, and we have a regular status check on each under-performing store. Year-to-date, these stores have improved cash flow versus last year by $5.2 million. In 2005, we're expanding this initiative to include a larger group of stores. We've already begun to see improvements in operating profit margins in Q2 and Q3 of this year, driven in part by our operating expense reductions. So, I'd like to end this portion of my presentation with a slide that I showed you at the beginning. We have two priorities. It's quite simple; optimize our North American real estate portfolio, and improve the operational execution out the store level. Everybody in our organization understands that. In order to get this done, we have restructured. We've created smaller areas of accountability for people. And the bottom line is that we believe that focusing on these two areas will allow us to grow profitability at retail in North America. Well, thanks for your time this morning. I would now like to bring up Monica Luechtefeld, and she'll share a few thoughts with you on our entry into the Northeast. I know that you're all anxious to see that. And when Monica's done, I'll come back up and entertain questions, and perhaps bring George and Joe back up with me. Thank you. Monica? Monica Luechtefeld - Office Depot Inc. - Global E-Commerce Thank you. As Rick said, I'm partnered with him on the Northeast strategy, so I came in the M2 colors, for those of you that haven't been to the M2 store. It's a privilege to be with you this morning, and to have a chance to share with you some of the information about our Northeast initiative. There are really three takeaways that I'd like you to leave with today. Yes, we've been opportunistic as we've looked forward into the Northeast and taken advantage of what the KRU deal brought us. But, at the same time, we've been strategic and focused as we've looked in the Northeast, focused in that we're looking at markets within the Northeast where we can draw density, and strategic because we're leveraging all of the Office Depot assets and bringing all to bear as we move into the Northeast, so that we win customers across the company and can drive the return on investments. As Neil and Rick told you, the Northeast is a very large market. It represents 30% of the GDP. But what you might not know is the Northeast really only represents about 6% of our current store count. So, there's clearly a lot of upside for us as we grow our share within that marketplace. Our goal and our focus is to take a look at markets, just as you have, where there's additional capacity for retail superstores, and to drive density into those markets. So, we're very focused and very specific. In addition, we intend to leverage all of our assets, and KRU provides us with an excellent starting place, an excellent footprint, to get going in the Northeast. And yes, that's the opportunistic part. But we've also got a new model to take to the Northeast and, as Rick has talked with you, a model that's meeting our customer's expectations with excellent customer reviews , and that's the M2 model. It's a very shoppable experience. Our customers are receiving the model very positively, and it's a much more efficient store for us to operate in the Northeast. The third point that we're leveraging in the Northeast is some of the information that Chuck brought to you, a differentiated assortment. We think there's a real opportunity as we move into the Northeast, to leverage some of the initiative we've already begun in the area of furniture, in particular. Our Christopher Lowell assortment is differentiated, unique, and has been widely accepted across the country. And, in fact, Chris is joining us this week in many of our Northeast markets to begin to introduce not only his style of furniture, but to make a differentiated experience for the Northeast customer about Office Depot and our office furniture. 28 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting At the same time in our merchandise mix, Chuck talked with you about technology, and technology and the wide assortment of technology that we bring to the Northeast shopper is another differentiated point for us. And the final and, perhaps, the most strategic element is the fact that we're really leveraging all of our assets. As Mark indicated to you, we have capacity in our CSCs in the Northeast, and we not only have some capacity in our Crossdock distribution, but can easily add additional capacity for those stores, from a servicing point of view. But some of you, as we spoke last night, probably don't realize how many assets we have in the Northeast in our BSG group. We have a large, active presence in our mid and large business customers in the Northeast already through our business services group. We also have strong presence in our Internet business and catalog business, and the stores provide a unique opportunity for us to pull all of those assets together so we all grow more. We're going to measure our success, as you would expect us to, on our share of market, as well as our operating profit growth, and then, of course, on what we do not only next year, but years after are driving incremental comps into the Office Depot chain. We looked at the Northeast, as many of you have looked at the Northeast. We looked at primary markets in the Northeast where there's additional capacity for stores, and we've been very focused in trying to find those markets where there's room for stores, not just to add a few, but also to build density where we add that room. And we've found those marketplaces, just as some of you have already outlined in your reports. We took another look at density related to saturation. A lot of times, you've focused on saturation as one of the key concerns. But equally important is the opportunity of having density in a marketplace. When we looked across all of the Office Depot chain and we looked at our average sales per square foot at retail, we found that we have real positive opportunities where we can get density, and that out-compensates, in some cases, for mid-point relative to saturation. We think that the markets we're entering in the Northeast in the large DMAs are going to perform about that average across the Office Depot chain, and we think there are some unique opportunities in the smaller MSAs for actually beneficial sales per square footage in the Northeast marketplace. Now, this chart looks a lot different when you're inside Office Depot. Our -- my friends yesterday had me remove quite a bit from this chart for you today. This is our Northeast expansion campaign and, suffice it to say, it's very specific and very targeted. And while the market looks wide, we are finding opportunities in small, individuals MSAs and, clearly, larger DMAs where we can find an opportunity to add stores because there's market capacity, and we can find an opportunity to build density. And Rick talked with you earlier about the discipline that he's instituted into our retail real estate team, and that team has a very disciplined approach to adding stores into this marketplace. So, entry into the Northeast is not just taking advantage of sort of the widespread geographic foothold that KRU gives us, but it's also based on a disciplined approach by Rick's real estate managers to fill in around those stores and find us density. One of the most differentiated part of our thrust into the Northeast is really the way we're approaching it from a multi-channel point of view. From a status update we've just barely begun, our first Northeast stores opened about three weeks ago, so we're just getting underway. We have some soft openings going on as we speak, and Rick's team has begun opening almost four a week, and will be for the balance of this year. So, we're just getting the momentum going right now. But our approach in the Northeast has really been a multi-channel approach. We've been leveraging those selling resources that are already in place and in market to begin telling their customers first about Office Depot coming to the marketplace. You'll hear from Cindy a little bit later today about the cross-channel shopping that our customers today have an opportunity to experience in other areas of the country. Our mid and large corporate customers, through their store purchasing card, have the ability in other areas of the country to walk into the retail stores for their rush and emergency purchases, and that drives quite a bit of incremental volume. Well, those customers are excited that they're now going to have the opportunity to shop at the Office Depot store adjacent to their business office for those rush and emergency purchases. And we're signing hundreds of those customers up every week for store purchasing cards as we begin opening in those marketplaces. In addition, our BSG sales force is in the marketplace introducing some of the smaller business customers to Office Depot's entry into that marketplace, and I can tell you from having spent quite a bit of time on the ground with the sales force and with the customers in the Northeast, that the customer response has been extraordinarily positive. They're excited to have a choice, and they're excited that we are coming to town. Our focus has been, as it always is, is to acquire long-term relationships with customers as opposed to a one-time grand opening purchase, and so we're leveraging 29 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting things that Chuck spoke about with the Advantage Card, and we're leveraging a business focus assortment to bring those customers back time and time again to the retail store. And the final point that we've been encouraged about has to do with though business count density. When you look at the Northeast market, the business density around each of our stores is substantially higher than what we find in other areas of the country with other successful Office Depot stores, and so we're very optimistic about that, too. What it looks like at the end of this quarter is we'll have a total of about 39 stores open just in this quarter in the Northeast. And by the end of the second quarter of next year, we'll have close to about 10% of our store count in the Northeast, up from that 6%. And as Rick has already said, there are plans to continue to keep that momentum going. So, in summary, our Northeast strategy is much more about simply opening up KRU stores. It's about discipline and strategic opportunities to fill in density around those stores and get density and penetration in each of those small and large marketplaces. Our Northeast strategy is also not simply a retail opening strategy, but it's a strategy that involves using our assets on the ground, our BSG sales force, our opportunities through our Intranet and our strong customer base that already sits in the Northeast, to use this as a leverage point and a communication point. And it involves leveraging our direct mail and catalog business into the marketplace at the same time, and we look for it as an opportunity to get real synergy out of this multiple channel approach. And so, our Northeast strategy is multiple in channel, focused, and disciplined. And with that, I'll invite Rick to come back and answer questions you may have. Thank you. Rick Lepley - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, NA Retail OK. Thanks, Monica. Just to remind you again, this is George Hill , our Senior Vice President of Regional Operations, and Joe Jeffries , our Vice President of Store Operations. So, questions? QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Unidentified Participant Yes, I've got one question for you, Rick, and then a question for Monica. Rick, when you were talking, you put up a slide that showed that you have 900 stores going to 970, then 1070 then 1170. You didn't show a slide that says you're going to open 70 then 100 then 100, and I guess my question is does that mean there's no store closings ahead, from the way you've formulated these slides? Rick Lepley - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, NA Retail Well, there probably could be a few store closings. Not a great number that I would foresee right now, but we're talking about a net increase with the slide that you're referring to. So, our net number of stores at the end of the year would be 970, 1070, 1170. Unidentified Participant And then the second question is for Monica. You mentioned that 6% of the store bases in the Northeast. Can you give us a sense of what percent of the delivery business is done via the Northeast? Monica Luechtefeld - Office Depot Inc. - Global E-Commerce I'll let Cindy answer that specifically. Where's Cindy ? Yes? 30 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting Cindy Campbell - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, NA Delivery Sales OK. Percentage - I happen to have a very bad cold and I can't hear very well, so forgive me for that. I think the question was percentage of delivery business in the Northeast relative to overall delivery business, right? I believe that the -- if you're talking Baltimore, New York, New England, that's probably about 23 % of total sales throughout BSG. There's a large presence in Baltimore. We've enjoyed that for some time, with some significant federal government business in that area. Unidentified Participant Great. Just a follow-up to -- then on that. I assume you are incentivizing the delivery customers, whether they're dotcom or catalog, or contract, to visit your stores. Can you tell us what kind of promotional offers you're offering to the contract customers in those markets? Cindy Campbell - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, NA Delivery Sales Should I talk again? Monica Luechtefeld - Office Depot Inc. - Global E-Commerce Sure, go ahead. Cindy Campbell - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, NA Delivery Sales It's important to understand that, for some time, we've counted store purchase card revenues in the bonus calculations for our field sales force. We removed those barriers several years ago, believing that it was very important to drive that type of behavior among our sales force, and encourage them to encourage our customers to use our stores to shop. And as such, I think store purchase card revenue growth has been very significant in the last several years. Monica Luechtefeld - Office Depot Inc. - Global E-Commerce I think another thing that Cindy's team is working on in the Northeast is the opportunity to leverage the employee benefits inside of our large corporate accounts. We have a lot of large corporate customers, and their employees are excited about the ability to get benefits and use our store for their own personal purchases and their home office business purchases. They'll be shopping our stores, and we'll be incentivizing them to shop our stores during particularly back-to-school, which is a consumer period, as well as the holiday period. And there are programs we're putting in place for those customers, too. Rick Lepley - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, NA Retail I'd add one thing, that the fastest growing region in the country for BSG is the Northeast. And I think with the presence of stores, that growth might even be fueled. What we found around the world is that stores tend to help the growth of the catalog business, the Internet business, the delivery business in general. Unidentified Participant Rick, when Bruce initially announced the Millenium remodeling program a few years back, one of the slides he put up was one that showed the average store age of Office Depot older than either Staples or Office Max. Now that you've sort of pulled back on your remodeling plans and you 31 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting want to see what kind of return you're going to get on those investments, how much of a disadvantage is that as you try to gather the troops and fight in the places you're already at with these older stores? Rick Lepley - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, NA Retail The trade-off is that they're, in some respects, more efficient to operate because the rent's lower, people are very familiar with where products are. I think you have to separate the two issues. One is, does it make sense to remodel, and at what dollar point do you cut it off. In other words, we know that M2 remodels ran between 250 and 275. We'll have 23 done by the end of this quarter. So, we'll take some time and analyze those and understand them before we go forward. It could be -- and, in fact, George has touched on a store now where I've given these guys a budget of $100,000 and said, Show me what that will do, because I'd like to understand the metrics of what kind of looks that gets, so, obviously, much easier to be able to make that pay than 275, let's say. I don't think we're at a disadvantage. If you look at our red stores, they're not really much different than our competitors' stores, in that -- everything's red. That's the disadvantage, is that, when the customer leaves any of those stores, he's sometimes even confused about which one he just shopped at. That's a fact. And I think that's the distinction we were also trying to incorporate into the design of M2. Unidentified Participant I just wanted to clarify something. You said George is regional head. Is that all the stores, or just some regions? Rick Lepley - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, NA Retail George is in charge of the regional operations. He's in charge of the six regions in the United States. Under the regions are the district managers, for example, and, of course, then the store managers. Joe is Vice President of Store Operations. If Office Depot had one store, Joe would run it. Nothing goes into a store without Joe approving it. Unidentified Participant So, in other words, George is similar to anyone who's the head of store operations in any other retail company, right? Rick Lepley - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, NA Retail It would be, yes. Unidentified Participant And I guess Chuck would be the head of merchandising in any retail company. But the difference is, George reports to you, but Chuck does not. Why is that? Rick Lepley - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, NA Retail It was just never set up that way. That's just the way Office Depot has been for a long time. Merchandising has never reported to store operations, at least in the time that I've been around. 32 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting Unidentified Participant Right. I mean, you're the head of the entire retail group, right? Rick Lepley - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, NA Retail I'm in charge of the stores in North America, yes. Unidentified Participant All right. You're the equivalent of another chain that has a CEO in charge of -- who's the head of a store ... Rick Lepley - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, NA Retail Well, it depends how you look at it. The way I tend to look at it is I'm Chuck's customer. I'm Mark's customer. They also have the same responsibilities to Cindy in the delivery business. So, when you compare us to other retailers, we're more than just a retailer. It's not that easy; because we have a merchandising function and a supplies function, but they have to also service our business services group, not just our stores. Unidentified Participant ... Another question I have, in terms of expanding Northeast, is Long Island is an attractive area, but it's very difficult to get -- find locations there, so I'm just wondering what your strategy -- or is that just an area that you're going to bypass and look at other areas that you can get in. Rick Lepley - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, NA Retail Actually, a couple of these sites are on Long Island, those KRU sites. I've been to Long Island twice in the last 60 days, and we can't prioritize every market, and we're not willing to say here which markets we have moved in front of others in terms of priority. But certainly, we're going to go to Long Island. It's just a matter of when. Unidentified Participant You have -- you're going to have stores in New Jersey pretty soon? Rick Lepley - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, NA Retail Sure. Already do. Unidentified Participant Thank you. Unidentified Participant Just two questions. One is, could you talk about the return on invested capital of the Northeast stores versus typical Office Depot opening up in markets where you already exist? 33 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting Rick Lepley - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, NA Retail Actually, maybe Charlie's going to talk about that later, could answer that question better, if you're specifically talking about the run on the KRU stores versus other stores we open. I'll probably let Charlie talk about that. Unidentified Participant I wasn't specifically talking about that (inaudible). But is this -- how long --I assume the store open in the Northeast is a high return store over the store opening up in the Northeast. Rick Lepley - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, NA Retail Yes, but it may not be the same return as a store in Florida, let's say, because the real estate could cost more in the Northeast. Unidentified Participant Right, so how much lower is it? Rick Lepley - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, NA Retail Well, specifically, I don't even know if I know that offhand, and I'm not going to guess and tell you. Little bit. Unidentified Participant Could you also help us with the math? The -- you bought 124 stores initially. You're only keeping 51. What is the  what does it work out to the average cost of the Office Depots that are bought, recognizing there are still some there? And the ones that you haven't gotten rid of, how are those being accounted for right now? Rick Lepley - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, NA Retail Well, as I told you, the initial deal was for 124 stores. Twenty-three stores fell out by mutual agreement. For one reason or another we couldn't use them. They may have had a restrictive covenant that prevented us from taking over the store. So, the bottom line is that the deal was 101 stores in the transaction. Charlie, do you know the final amount with those specific 101? Yes, our cost, I don't know if you know it or not. Charlie Brown - Office Depot Inc. - EVP & CFO We're going to end up with about $20 million that's essentially the uncovered price. So, were evaluating stores in the Northeast are organic expansion, just like we would anywhere else, so we still have a hurdle rate, and they have to clear it. Clearly, that wasn't the case with KRU. KRU we viewed as a strategic initiative, and that excess was essentially a market-entry premium. And so, what you have to believe is we can follow it up with incremental stores next year in the Northeast of around 50, then 50 after that, and then it starts to be very accretive. But KRU by itself is not. Rick Lepley - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, NA Retail So, effectively, it's not a nucleus to build around. Did that answer your question about the stores that fell out and the number that were finalized? 34 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting Charlie Brown - Office Depot Inc. - EVP & CFO The question was how are we accounting for the stores that we don't have a deal on. We're accounting for those as surplus property, just like we would when we close a store. So, we're accruing up the rent through the life of the lease, and then taking an estimate of sub - rental income against that. So, very conservative in that regard. Rick Lepley - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, NA Retail Then, at most, there will only be 15 of those to deal with. Unidentified Participant OK, two questions, actually. Just a follow-on to the last one is I think what we're trying to get at is what the actual purchase price is for the stores that you're keeping, and then my question is, obviously, you've got a preference for a small format. What can we do, over time, to reduce the size of these stores? In other words, is relocation strategy going to be a big part of your real estate program going forward? I notice you only had about 12 this year. Is there an opportunity to have, let's say, 40 in a given year? Rick Lepley - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, NA Retail Yes, that tells you -- I'll let Charlie answer the KRU question when he comes up. You maybe could ask that later. But, we've got 321 stores right now that are larger than 33,000 square feet. We think that's probably, in many cases, too large. Some of those are delivery stores, so they need to be that big. But clearly, we look at every lease as it expires and try to make a determination as to whether or not we really need a building that big. And in many cases, it's less expensive to relocate than it is to remodel, effectively. So, if we can, in the next two or three years as we reposition this, if we can move to newer malls or better locations and get in the smaller buildings, even if we have to pay a couple of dollars more, it still might be a better consideration for us because we can run a smaller store with fewer people. We can run it with less inventory. And we think that our returns will be just as good or better as they've been in the big stores when they were really running good. So -- if, for example, we took two 33,000 square foot buildings, effectively, we could relocate into two 20s and then put a third store in, so we could have three stores of 20,000 square feet. We would still have reduced by 10% the square footage we have at retail, but now we'd have three stores instead of two. I'd take that any day if I could, because we know stores are going to drive the delivery business. They're just like advertising monuments out there, in a sense, for the rest of our businesses. Unidentified Participant I've got two questions. The first relates to your Northeast opening. It seems like, as you talk about the opportunities in front of you, you've laid out one set of operating initiatives that should benefit the entire chain, and then you're laying out the geographic opportunity, and it sounds like it's compelling, longer term. But my -- to some degree, weigh on short-term financial returns. And correct me if I'm wrong on that. I guess the question is how much dilution, or how much of a wait , if you will, on the overall financial results of the retail business do you think the Northeast expansion will be? Rick Lepley - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, NA Retail Well, I can't give you an exact number, but I would tell you the way I look at it. Any time you open 100 stores, there's a high probability that a lot of them will still not be making money a year later. That's just the reality of it. So, I would hope that all the operational improvements and savings we can create would offset the amount of money we'd lose opening 100 new stores the first year they were open. So, as you can see, we were 35 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

If we could hold that line while we open 100 new stores for the next two years, that'd be pretty good, in my mind. Long-term, I think we can be up in the 7-8% range of contribution from stores. Unidentified Participant So, the implication is that it's more or less a wash? Rick Lepley - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, NA Retail If I could do that, I'd be happy, yes. Unidentified Participant Fair enough. The second question relates to multi-channel strategies. You've operated in multiple channels for a number of years, in a number of markets. This is something that we've heard about in the sector from time to time. It's unclear what kind of results have emerged from it, and I guess it's getting a bit of a higher profile as you move into the Northeast of incremental opportunity. Can you talk about your experiences in other markets, geographies where you've operated with multiple channels over a number of years, and talk to the results that's yielded? Rick Lepley - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, NA Retail Well, I can even talk to you about other countries, and the result's not going to be that much different. What you need first is retail to drive image. No matter what we'd like to think, retail forms the image people have of our whole company. And once you've put in stores, it gives you credibility to then build a Web site that people can access perhaps in the store but then, ultimately, from home, to have products delivered. It certainly helps your -- when you have feet on the street on those stores, because people know who they are and where they're from when they come in, and it gives credibility to your catalog business and your delivery business overall. So, I think that, in most cases, where it's possible, retail actually makes it easier to build a delivery business. In some places in Europe where they started with the Viking brand, for example, they started with a catalog business and, because the infrastructure was there, it was easier to add the contract business without the store business. But, in other parts of the world, we found that -- and I believe the United States, as well -- it's easier to do it conversely. I think it's a little easier to add stores first. In the Northeast, we already have a BSG business that's growing, and I think that can only help us as we put stores in, because there will be a familiarity. You also saw in the slides that there was a very high degree of unaided awareness of Office Depot that exists in the Northeast. So effectively thats an investment weve been making over the last ten years, but we couldnt reap anything from it because we had no storage there. So now hopefully, that will aid us when we are trying to launch new stores there. Unidentified Participant I think we have time for one more question, up front. Unidentified Participant (Inaudible), I had a question for Rick. Rick, you thought six regions if you looked across the regions. What's the variation and kind of metrics in terms of returns or performance across the regions? Or are they pretty uniform? Rick Lepley - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, NA Retail Well, the contribution doubles from our worst to our best. I can tell you that. 36 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting Unidentified Participant And then ... Rick Lepley - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, NA Retail I want these guys to answer something before we leave. Unidentified Participant So then let him explain what he thinks accounts for the variation. [Laughter] Rick Lepley - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, NA Retail Why do we have the variation? Why are some regions twice as profitable as others? George Hill - Office Depot Inc. - SVP, NA Retail Operations I think some of it has to do with real estate, obviously, is a big lever that we pull there. I think also competition in the local market. I mean there are a lot of influences that will get you to different types of levels of profitability. But I will tell you from certainly the operational standpoint for me, there's also a tremendous amount of efficiency that we can gain by using the best in class type mentality to get the same execution level, let's say, in the Southeast as we would in the Northwest or, as we would in Southern California as we would in Dallas. Typically prior to you getting here, I think that we've worked in a silo mentality often, and haven't leveraged the 923 stores we currently have today. I think we can gain a significant amount of contribution and consistency just by leveraging these stores to its uses. Rick Lepley - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, NA Retail That's it? Sean McHugh - Office Depot Inc. - Director, IR Thank you, Rick. Thank you, Monica. Unidentified Participant Thank you. Sean McHugh - Office Depot Inc. - Director, IR We'll break for lunch for one hour. Please be back here at quarter past one. The room is right down the hall to your left. Thank you.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting PRESENTATION Sean McHugh - Office Depot Inc. - Director, IR Looks like most everyone's here back from lunch. Welcome back to the afternoon session. I'm very pleased to introduce Cindy Campbell, who's our Executive Vice President of Delivery Sales. Thank you. Cindy Campbell - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, NA Delivery Sales Thanks Sean. Good afternoon. Delighted to be able to talk to you about Delivery Sales today. When I'm finished, I hope that I will have communicated a clear strategy for growth, that is profitable growth in delivery segment. Before I get started, I would like to introduce some of the key members of my team that have joined me today. Brandon Choice, the Vice President of Marketing for the Business Services Group, John Russo (ph) runs our East Region of our Contract Group, and Tim McGrath is our Vice President of Customer Service and Call Centers. I'd like to start with a brief grounding of delivery sales to make sure that we are all on the same page. Delivery sales represent about $4 billion in sales. We deliver to small, medium, large and national customers. We have two brands in the process of doing that; the Office Depot brand and the Viking brand. When I talk about small customers, I'm talking about customers in the 10 to 49 employee range. Medium customers are typically 50 to 249, large is 250 and above. And national are actually named accounts. The complexity of the buying process increases as you move up that continuum. At the lower end, typically there are transactional relationships, decisions are made by administrative people, sometimes the CEO or CFO, of the smaller firms. As you work the chain it becomes an increasingly a complex sale. A lot of relationship building is required and you compete on a wide variety of metrics. We have about 1400 sales people in our Business Services Group. They are supported by 60 local sales offices. Domestic e-commerce sales in 2003 were 2.3 billion and over 60% of sales are done in the channel through e-commerce. To give you a sense, domestic e-commerce sales total 2.3 billion of the 2.6 you see on the screen. E-commerce was 24% of our business in the year 2000, 60% in the 2003; dramatic growth among our contract customer group and our catalog group. When we talk about our catalog business Id like you to know Office Depot brand uses over 20 different versions of catalogs to reach its customer set. The Viking brand uses over 90 versions of catalogs. The Office Depot contract group uses ten different versions of catalogs. We have a circulation of about 100 million all told. Our financial performance, we have a strong focus on lowering costs and driving operating profit. Our compound annual growth rate in sales was 3.1% from 2000 to 2003. Our operating profit was almost ten times that. We experienced reduction in sales force beginning in 1999 and that reduction and the consistent use of sales payroll to improve operating profits really cut down our sales growth opportunities. I would like to say that my supply chain friends contributed significantly to that operating profit improvement through DMO and CSC consolidation and the wonderful work they have done in lowering our costs in that whole the supply chain environment. 38 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting Well, it's important that I communicate that we have not been in the sales headcount growth mode since 1999. We compete on several different elements and they are specific to the channel for each customer's segment. In contract, we must be responsive, have a responsive sales group, a responsive, an excellent sales support capabilities. The thought about lowest cost of total ownership not necessarily lowest cost of the individual SKU. I think that's a consistent message that youve heard in this space in the past. Service must be excellent and you must have user friendly e-commerce solutions, a broad catalog assortment is important as is the competitive pricing and of course, free next-day delivery. Our OD commercial value proposition is every day low price. EDLP for our cross channel shopping synergies that exist between our catalog and our stores organization. We have a market leading customer loyalty program in the form the Advantage program and of course we provide free next-day service delivery. The Viking commercial brand is a bit different. It is run with appeals to non-office super store customers. It's highly promotional in nature and highly personalized. That's the 90 plus catalogs that reach that customer group. There are 24/7 live customer service with no IVR and offer free and in some cases same-day delivery. Computers4Sure is our technology group that allows us to have a broadly enhanced in our standard technology assortment. Highly trained help and account managers support this brand. The way we use this, our BSD sales force finds options and alternatives for Computers4Sure to hand out a friendly warm lead to Computers4Sure to close and thus we have an integrated approach with our BSD sales force. It is a virtual inventory model in Computers4Sure. I think the most important way that we compete in the contract business has to do with the responsiveness to the customer and customer requirements. You can compete on many dimensions and we do all day long. We just completed some surveys that said, let me show you so you can understand our customer insights with greater clarity. There many of them up here and I'm sure you can't see all of them. Some are by design. Of the top five that we compete on are price and value, sales representative, products selection, accurate deliveries and customer service. Four out of five of those are truly easily replicable by our competition. What cannot be easily replicated is our sales force. In this study, the foundational research that we did, we learned that our customers believe Office Depot sales representatives are highly responsive and the most important aspect of quality of their capabilities is solving problems. We need to be in a responsive position and able to solve customer problems. That is how we differentiate the Office Depot brand and our contract group moving forward. I think it's important for you to understand that we have made important investments in our sales force this past year. I am delighted that those investments really support the message of responsive problem solving sales people. We brought to the force a training program that's not been in place before. Many of you are aware or familiar with PSS, professional selling skills, its probably the gold standard of selling skills training. We outsourced the (inaudible) skills training as well as (inaudible) sales negotiations and winning account strategies to our sales teams this year. Our goals are foundational training that will help develop our sales force in terms of being the type of responsive, problem solving field representatives our customers expect. We also learned how some of our past business practices may have interfered with our ability to grow our market. In a sense we created some walls between our customers. (inaudible) Viking and Office Depot catalogs, for example, did not sharing prospecting files. The customers are different but now we are allowing them to have a choice between the brands or allowing them to self select. I'll show you that in just a moment. 39 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting I think an example in the past might have a small contract customer that would have been acquired by contract sales person. Those contract sales people have hundreds of accounts and as is human nature I think accounts that aren't growing and that are on the small end of the spectrum will tend to not receive as much attention from the account representatives as they might have wished. Our practices in the past kept us to support that customer from being visible to our catalog channels. We didn't direct mail to that customer, relied on the sales representative to meet the needs of that customer moving forward. The only person that was contacting those customers was our competition. Today we have a small accounts that are served by sales representatives. We trade those directly into the catalog stream, they participate in a package insert program. We have intelligent sampling available to those customers segments. We support them through telephone account management. We will support their purchase behaviors through other means as necessary. Essentially, what we've done, is we've removed those walls. Management is now reporting on customer segment focus, not just channel performance. Instead of having a sub-optimal use of our assets we've maximized our assets through our actions to make sure that we penetrate and retain customers as appropriate to the channel in which the wish to be served. There are some other elements that may have impacted our growth in the past. In the large national area, we have decreased headcount every year since 1999 as I said earlier. So obviously that would require an investment in sales headcount. I am proud to talk about that fact that we'll be adding significant headcount in the year 2005. In fact we're in a hiring mode right now. We intend to have people in place, hired and trained before the end of the year. They'll be hitting January ready to produce revenue. Weve also needed to shift our acquisition resources. Many of you are who have followed us know that we've redeployed the sales force for the year 2004. Instead of a generalist handling a territory we've deployed based on acquisition and maintenance and penetration. That proved to be a valuable alternative, a valuable strategy because we were able to generate new customers that were vigorous customers, a more solid revenue stream. And we're able to penetrate our existing base at a higher rate. What we didn't get quite right was the focus or distribution of those assets. And I'll talk to you about that in just a moment. In terms of our medium and the small customers and the Office Depot brand, we used some acquisition methods that were not particularly the most profitable. They attracted customers but they were not lifetime value customers. So we've changed that. And we are allocating our contact media a little bit differently in 2004 through 2005. We also had little response to competitive pressure in that area. We've made some investments in higher touch vehicles including telephone account management. We've had pilots in telephone account management in operation virtually throughout the year. Weve realized (inaudible) of telephone account management resources under the direction of one individual. And we have a program that addresses the needs of customers in the contracts space as well as the catalog space moving forward. In the Viking brand the existing customer base is healthy. Customers would buy from Viking and like Viking and are continuing to do so. We had an integration effort for Viking brand. It was really far reaching. It went beyond just Viking to incorporate our best practices for the Office Depot brand. That was the benefit to the catalog space in general but it did put more pressure on the Viking brand throughout the year. The integration was completed about three weeks ago. We had done our first (inaudible) in the data warehouse using Viking this past week. Our issue on the Viking brand is growing new sales from new customer types and with our data warehouse now being visible to us, we can attach resources to that issue and get that solved with that. Based on the indications I just talked about, here's what you're going to see in 2005. We're going to be seeing more sales resources, a bigger pie so to speak. And you'll see a re-slicing of that pie. You'll see more assets applied to acquisition side of our sales force while we maintain the penetration and maintenance group. More resources, focused a little bit differently. 40 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting In the catalog, or the small to medium customer side, instead of simply addressing those customers for catalog only, we're going to implement multiple touch to customers based again on size not channel. We will use sales people to acquire accounts. We will use our telephone account management to maintain and penetrate accounts and well use catalogs as another means of staying in touch with our customers and adding value. You've seen the announcement on our call centers and some of you have asked are we going to cut our customer service in the interest of cost savings. The answer was an emphatic no. That is not the plan and that is not the reason why we made the decision that we've made. We all have fiduciary responsibilities to try to drive the best profits for our company. In the case of Office Depot, over the last four years we have taken cost out of our call centers. In 2005 we are going to reduce our call centers from 13 today to three moving forward. We're not doing that lightly; were not doing that without a lot of consideration. In fact something that's not well known is that over 25% of our call center volume has been virtually outsourced on a domestic basis in the year 2004. We have an award-winning, Six Sigma-based Voice of the Customer approach. Were making sure that we understand what our customers think of our service. (inaudible) has been throughout the year and we have measured the service quality of our domestic outsourced providers. They provide at or better than the level of service provided by Office Depot. We have reason to believe and metrics to support the fact that services remain consistent and possibly improved as we go toward outsourcing our call centers. Our strategy is going to be to maintain those things that are critical activities. Such things as supporting national accounts, special orders, government and school account that are specified as special purchases and requirements, attend to Internet technical support, for all the things we retain within the Office Depot call centers that we own and maintain and manage ourselves. Importantly that is a great big segment as it should be (inaudible) our prison orders will have to maintained by Office Depot because there's a certain aspect of assortment that we don't want to make available to the inmates. But we'll be retaining that in-house as well. We are outsourcing demand fulfillment, not demand creation. I think that's a critical concept. And of course we will be maintaining our voice of the customer service levels throughout the year. So I guess I just want to leave you with some overall themes. We're moving from channel centric to customer centric, using all of our resources to attach to customers that would benefit from different touch streams. We are, for the first time in years, increasing our sales headcount and we're doing so by more than 10%. We'd like to fine-tune our deployment strategy by refocusing our pie on acquisition resources, heading with the larger percentage of the overall account manager base. We have new contact strategies for our small and medium customers. We are optimizing our acquisition spend. And we have call center optimization, which started to see about $15 million in savings on an annual basis. You won't see that in 2005 because of the reduction expense. But you will see that, part of that, in 2005 when we realize that on an annual basis moving forward in 2006 and beyond. All of these things should lead us to profitable sales growth for delivery channel in 2005. And with that, I'd be happy to answer any of your questions. 41 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting I was so articulate you have nothing to ask. Oh, there's one. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Unidentified Participant Cindy, we've been hearing a lot about the competitive environment heating up, particularly in contract. Can you talk a little bit about that from your perspective? Has it been getting more intense? Do you expect it to get even more intense than it has been as companies are all looking for growth now? Cindy Campbell - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, NA Delivery Sales Yes. Well, I've never done a type of contract where it wasn't pretty intense from a competitive standpoint. I think it depends a lot on which segment you're talking about. So let me address this on a customer specific or a customer segment basis. In a small to medium size it's all about touch. It's who's been billed last. These are not sophisticated decisions that are being made. There's a lot of turnover in the people who are making those decisions. We have the same special touch customers. I believe that that competition is relatively stable, we just haven't had a good answer to that and we're deploying a new answer for that this year. The middle to large customer segment I have not seen a tremendous amount of new competition or a higher level of competition there. I think on the very highest level it is extraordinarily competitive. There are pressures from a margin standpoint. There are pressures in terms of making sure that you have a global solution. And people are having to try to take market share at the high end and then balance that portfolio between medium and smaller customers. So that is my take on it at this point. OK? Unidentified Participant Can you discuss the different mixes, the different mix of business between contract and Viking and Office Depot in terms of how big each one is and which is the most profitable? Cindy Campbell - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, NA Delivery Sales Yes. We don't go there. I think we put on delivery sales on a public basis. And as to differently, I'm going to stick with that. Unidentified Participant I'll ask a different question. [Laughter] 42 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting Cindy Campbell - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, NA Delivery Sales OK. I don't care. Unidentified Participant Could you go a little bit into Viking? That seems to have had some issues and you addressed some of it here. But what caused the problems specifically at Viking? Cindy Campbell - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, NA Delivery Sales Well I think if we're being very forthright and I like to be that way. We started playing with the Viking value proposition when we integrated our warehouses. Viking had separate warehouses and had maintained and operated a separate brand for a long time after we acquired them. We tried to start realizing some cost savings by integrating with our warehouses. And frankly I think that may have caused a sort of trouble that those customers did not expect. It wasn't a positive experience for them. Viking is going to require some very significant and some specific sectors. We'll be bringing somebody on to head that Viking brand here in 2005. You may not know, but it hasn't had a separate head since the beginning of this past year. So the problems and the issues with Viking, that's a focus which will be changed; a dark warehouse to an improved integration, we're out of the darkness now. And the service issues, we'll have to find a way to compete on a little different basis than what we have in the past. OK? PRESENTATION Cindy Campbell - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, NA Delivery Sales Well, it gives me to pleasure to introduce my colleague from Europe, Mr. Rolf Van Kaldekerken. Rolf van Kaldekerken - Office Depot Inc. - President, European Operations Good afternoon and welcome to the European part of Office Depot's business. I would like to start with a comment related to one of newest priorities, which is our accountability. I think this is more of an issue in Europe as explained a little bit earlier. Because since I was the President of Europe I have been fully accountable for the European business. But you know what? I have the pleasure to share this accountability and sometimes this pressure you have on your shoulders with a great team. And some of them are here, most of them, are doing the work at home. And actually they are creating the growth you're all expecting from the business. Let me introduce you again to Graham Cundick, Rob Vale, Wim van Aalst, and Jamie Gould. They're all in the back. Jamie Gould is our International Vice President of Finance. OK, just to start with review of the European International business, I have to say. But I think it's fair to say that about 95% of it is Europe. 43 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting We will finish the year with about $3.5 billion in sales, some operations in 21 countries and we are in the direct mail contract e-commerce, and retail business. Primary business to business or if you're just getting our first experience to consumer web sites in Germany and U.K., which are very promising. We are the first company in Europe, which provide a web site to private consumer. Business upgraded by local management team. I think this is important to point out. This was always the strength of Viking based on local management. They know the market. They know the specificities of the market. They know the competitor. And they are most, or best situated, to really manage the local business. The country managers owns the P&L and they all report to Rob Vale or to me indirectly by report, or to me. We are multi-channel, multi-brand provider. This is very important to understand. While in each part of the business we have to compete against the specialists or the retailer, against the retailer and the contractor against the contractor and then the mail order against the mail order company. This is the last (inaudible) of the European countries. You see very clearly that mail order and contract are the two major drivers of our business. So retail would be only a selective part of our business in Europe. You see we are in two countries in France and in Spain and then we're adding Hungary. We are a little bit early and I'll come back to Eastern Europe in a couple of minutes. So the clear focus is our mail order and contract. This is the contribution to the market or to our business in Europe, 7% on retail, 44% on contract, 49% on mail order. Our mail order is still the biggest and obviously the most, is the highest profit margin. Contract will be the growth engine in the future in Europe and this is just based on the fact that 60% of the total market is left by contractors. Market in view of is huge, 250 million plus, but it's fair to say that at this point in time, and if you look at the impact Germany has, over 60 million, that this is impacting European economy quite heavily. Europe, or specifically Germany, is going through a tough time. And the economic impact in Germany on the status from the social perspective, from a political perspective, are - it's not the most promising in the world. And just recently there was a statistic done by European union in the world of from the U.N., some organization. And they investigated the last 10, 15 years and the 18 most industrial nations in the world and the first three were Australia, U.S., and Denmark. And guess who was the last two? It was France and Germany. And those are, by accident, two of the big countries in Europe. The good news about that is that Europe is still a very, very fragmented market, which means great potential. This is something we just impacted by the good acquisition very clearly. We are the market leader in Europe. We are twice the size of our next competitors, which are Lyreco and Staples. And then there's a company called Buhrmann or you know them over here as Corporate Express, which is the number four in Germany. It is important to notice that all those four companies together are not presenting more than probably 15 to maybe 18, 19% of the total market, which again underlines the fact that there is a great potential. However, we have to see some local vendors in that, which are not on the map here. But for example in Germany there's a very strong mail order company called Printus . There is a very good company in the Netherlands, Ahrend, which is about a size of 350 million. There are some local competitors, which are very, very strong. 44 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting What information on sales and operating profit in the last couple of years? I think it would be fair to say that there is an impact in the dollar figures on 2001, 2002 based on the negative impact on exchange rates while in 2003 and 2004 there's very clearly positive impact from exchange rates. Operating profit 2001, 2002, exactly the same number in operation besides that. There's a very easy explanation for that. Because this was the time when we really started to reinvest into the growth of our business. We started the Office Depot contract business in France, Netherlands, Italy, and Germany while we had started our first European country contract in U.K. in 2000. We have started mail order in Switzerland, in Spain, and in Portugal. And we have started retail in Spain, all around the same time frame and then in 2003 and 2004 the acquisition of Guilbert. 2004 year- to-date performance; year to date catalog mail order is practically flat compared to last year. I think it would be fair to say here while the Guilbert acquisition has not directly impacted the mail order business, I think through due diligence and afterward through an integration process, we have lost focus of our core business at this point in time, the mail order. And we paid for that a little bit. But we are addressing issues. And we see now very, very nice growth coming back. Contract growth down mid-single digits on a comparative basis. And again I come back just a little on the next slide and give you some more information on that. But here one information is extremely important to understand is we started with about 1,500 sales staff on the Guilbert side after the acquisition. But part of the integration trial was to let 240 people go. So you know the kind of 5% negative when you lose more than 10%. If you deliberately you lose more than 10% of your sales force, it paints you a little bit of the real picture of the situation. Retail, we're enjoying very nice comp sales growth in France and in Spain. France, by the way, is a very, very nice turn around. About a year and a half ago we started the turn around plan. France is losing, retail is losing quite a bit of money and now we have recreated growth, we have recreated vitality of driving this part of the business in profitability. Last quarter of this year we will be breakeven operating profit and 2005 the full year. Just one side information on that as well. And it isn't the whole business in Europe. On June 3 when we concluded the acquisition of Guilbert, we had the key in our hands. We had 10,400 people in Europe working for us. Today we have 9,300. And we achieved that by just, if you look at the sales, just a couple of percentage below last year. Go to market strategy, this is by like a very, very clear strategy, how we want to grow to the market. And while this is sort of explanatory, I would like to go a little bit more into detail into the brown part of it where you see TAM contract, TAM mail order. What we did today and I believe that we are one of the or maybe the only company in Europe which has that, but we attack the market from two sides. From the top with the combination of field sales, of office sales with people together with telephone account management. And we do the same from the bottom with the mail order value proposition and with telephone account management. And this will be one of the major revenue drivers for the next couple of years. So, let's look a little bit at some of the specifics about Guilbert. I just mentioned the minus 240 sales staff. For sure what we tried to do is to lose only not so good performance people. Unfortunately, this was not always possible. So we lost quite a few guys. But then we're speaking with 80, 90% of those 240 were the under performing people. We achieved and exceeded positive synergies we projected in the plan to the Board. We disposed of about 66 million of the business of Guilbert. In Italy, in the Netherlands, in Germany, retail stores, furniture business, which we consider not part of our core business. 45 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting We integrated already three warehouses. We integrated already two country headquarters. We already achieved 225 and as we speak probably 10, 15 more, savings on the G&A side. And the business continues to deliver 10% segment operating profit. Is this a bad business to be in? I don't believe so. And the question is, do I want, or would I do Guilbert again? And this goes back when before we took the final decision, Bruce Nelson said to me, Rolf, you are the last person. You have to say yes or no. Do you want to do that? If you would ask me this question or year to date would ask me this question I would say very clearly, yes. What I fully agree and accept to is the fact that we have not achieved the sales growth we projected in plan to the board. Are we being too optimistic? Yes, probably. If we knew enough from the due diligence process, have we seen enough of the company to judge all these kinds of assets very, very carefully, maybe not? So this part I feel, guilty maybe is not the right word, I assume a responsibility that this was too optimistic and we are probably over, how do you say that, estimated our capabilities in changing a few things, which I will talk right now. Remaining integration task we quantified into the growth, implementation of a common IT system that is IT system. Hindsight is always good. This decision we have taken about four or five months ago. If I would do software integration again, this decision, I would do that day one. This was a mistake, very clearly. But we rectified it and we're now going in one direction. Based on the decision, we are now able to integrate and consolidate service warehouses. We started with 32 last year and the goal is to go to 22 by the end of 2006. We continue to streamline the process and rationalize costs. To give you an idea, just mentioned, we have eliminated 225 G&A positions. We believe in the next one or two years we will create further synergies for at least 100, maybe up to 150 positions. And, by the end of next year, 2005, we will have consolidated all the country headquarters. Just a second, excuse me. While I'm extremely proud that we have taken all the important decisions, country management teams, European management teams, within the first 30 to 90 days, the physical combination of the headquarters just needed a little bit of time. And we have started in two countries and we will do the rest before the end of next year. Reinvigorate Guilbert growth. Change will be a constant part of our process until we have the right team in place, very, very clearly. This is not yet the situation. We still have to do a little bit to make sure that all the key managers in the contract business understand that keeping the business is not enough. That growing business is to be part of a winning team is much more fun and important. How are the changes on the way with real great progress? We see enormous increase in new customer acquisition to create a part of the team the winning culture and not accepting anymore to be the second. We will beat the market. Key account growth in field sales is something which is very important. If you look at the U.K. and the French business, U.K. is dominated in the contract part by key accounts , by the bigger accounts. And the field sales, which is the smaller part of it, is under served at this point in time. France is the other way around, 50, 60% or even more is field sales, small or medium-sized customer and key account is under represented . So this is where we will invest. And by the way, we are actually in the process to hire around 150-200 new sales people. Not just here on the street, on the telephone account side as well as on the field sales itself. 46 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting Cindy mentioned a little bit the worldwide potential we have. We have seen some nice wins recently on worldwide accounts. And we will see much more. This will be, by the way, one of the other drivers for growth. We will be the most aggressive player on the market. Im proud to say that we did not lose any big account in the last six to 12 months. The lesson I learned was in Germany about nine or 10 months ago. And we tendered German Telecom. And at this point in time, it was not yet so clear what the direction and the instruction was. So, we lost it to somebody else. I can tell you, we will not lose again such a big account. We have some recent examples in France which is the electricity company, a 22 million account for us, we retained. In UK, Lloyds is a 20 million pound account, we retained. And again, will not lose any big customers. And will win much more. Mail order and retail  while it says customer retention is top priority, it is absolutely true. Because if you lose more customers than you win, you will never create a good business. So, retention  we give you an idea on the Viking side, retention rates are anywhere between 65 and up to 75, 78%. So this is a nice business. But retention and reactivation is as important. We lose customers if you like it or not. But we have now found ways to reactivate those customers and make it to lifetime customers. Enhanced customer loyalty programs. Its more and more important. I mentioned the TAM model, which may be the growth engine for the company. One area where we have to become better or even better is in our advertising model for the mail order business. Its the biggest cost we have and we need to become even better. And based on what I would call already world class direct marketing capabilities. And I think Viking is well known for its fantastic value proposition and the direct marketing capabilities. I mentioned retail France is a very nice story. Last year, September, the first month is positive comp sales and since then, we have enjoyed two-digit comp sales. Actually, the business is growing by about 20%. We projected losses at the beginning of the year. Actually, were doing only 40% of the losses. And as I said a little bit earlier, quarter four will be operating profitably. But there is other (inaudible) related to France and its Viking. Viking is losing market share for about one and a half, two years. We put a turnaround plan in place. So, the team in force from France, European and September  August was a crazy month this year in Europe. But September, we could see the first results and it was about flat compared to last year. October was already 4%. November, after three weeks, is over 10% growth. If you put all your efforts together, make sure everybody goes in the same direction, then you create a success story, independent on the market. Eastern Europe  the potential of Eastern Europe is about 500 billion. Its a huge market. We did the first step in acquiring the license back from the license partner we had given. And based on the Hungarian team, which is lead by guy called Estvon Mulich (ph), just a wonderful guy. Hes the entrepreneur, but hes, as well, a fighter, I believe, is the right impression. He won the silver medal at wrestling as the world champion in 1983 or 84. Im not small, as you can see, but he is like  and he is very, very competitive. Three stores in Hungary and their contract business is making money. And this is remarkable. And with the start expansion from  with the Hungarian team next year and you can see the countries which we will probably go first  Czech Republic, Slovenia. Poland is different  theyre in Chapter 11 and we will just wait until this is over and maybe start then from scratch. Theres some  one part missing. You see that the countries on the  which I mentioned a little bit earlier  theyre still kind of white or black part, which is Scandinavia. As Irwin Helford always used to say, with the name of Viking  we have to be in Scandinavia one day. And I give you my word. We will be one day. OK. Let me just summarize. First and most important, what is on top of my mind. I can tell you what it is since, about, the last six, nine, 12 months is to create growth. Im more than comfortable that we are able to create growth. Focus on accountability, clear P&L ownership, we have that in place by country and by channel. Operational excellence and execution, this is the basis, what we have to deliver to our customer. Now a disappointed customer, all this convince them by your fanatical customer services. (inaudible) some of you know Irwin Helford. And he was famous for that. 47 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting If you impress your customers, they not look at any other sources. But the key of it is, you have to deliver what you promise to the customer. We have to be best in class, second is not good enough. We have to be the number one. And we will create a long lasting profitable growth, which automatically will result in increasing shareholder value. Focus on team, I said a little bit earlier, (ph) three of my colleagues or four of my colleagues here, many more at home. I would like to give you an example of what this means from a European perspective. You all know the contest, great places to work. And I know that theres always and (inaudible). One is to be at Office Depot is one of the hundred best companies to work for in the United States. Two years ago we have participated a first time in five European countries. And in the first year, we had number two in the Netherlands, number four in Germany, number five in Austria, number nine in Belgium. In U.K. it was amongst the best 50. We did it again this year and for the first time, one of the Office Depot countries is the best working place in the country. We have been elected number one in Austria and again number four in the Netherlands, number six in, I think it was in Belgium, number 14 in Germany. And this is impacted a little bit by the Guilbert acquisition. This is a great place to work. Focus on results. We will create next year, low to mid single digit growth. We establish here that the fastest growing and most profitable division in Office Depot has become the dominant player in our industry in Europe with the highest returns. Stay on top of the competition and beat the market, not follow the market. This is a clear message. I can assure you that you can count on Europe in creating the most compelling place to work, to shop and to invest. It was a pleasure to give you a little overview of Europe, if you have any questions, please do so. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Unidentified Participant Hi. Could you please take the four markets in Europe, the largest ones, Germany, France, the U.K. and Italy and kind of rank them for us, which is the best, which is the not so good. And maybe talk about the key opportunities for improvement in each of them to the extent that there might be differences in the country. Rolf van Kaldekerken - Office Depot Inc. - President, European Operations OK, the biggest European country by far is the U.K. where we have two channels which are very big; Viking and the contract business. But there are still huge opportunities in the U.K. So we still, by the way, the U.K. Viking business is growing even after 14 years. We did it again this year The number two country is very clearly France. This is where I see the biggest opportunities in terms of sales growth but much more profitable growth. France is not today performing to the extent we would like to see. This is where we will see great improvements and really the big piece of it coming. And this is contract partly, but its much more Viking and the retail business. Number three is Germany, what we have to accept is Germany is probably 80% Viking, probably 85 and 15% contract. If you look at a potential, Germany from a contract perspective has the biggest potential in Europe. And this is by the way where we invest very heavily at this peak. Italy is a very specific example. Mail is not such an important vehicle of doing the purchase in southern Europe, Spain, Italy and so. This is kind of a nice and important, a profitable business. The growth is in Italy in contract. I mentioned a little bit early we disposed. We sold our Italian business from Guilbert and we started really at zero. 48 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting We kept 20, 27 people from the former Guilbert business out of 280. And we really started at zero. The growth rate, as we speak in Italy are tremendous but on a (inaudible) level. So this was the potential for the next couple of years. But you should not underestimate countries like Benelux. This is a very highly profitable business. And where you are gaining, the competition is very strong but you still have a potential and specifically in the contract area. Unidentified Participant On one of the slides, you mentioned that growth is impacted a lot by significant price decreases in ink and toner and paper. What caused that because we havent seen that in the U.S. Rolf van Kaldekerken - Office Depot Inc. - President, European Operations OK, HP is a worldwide strategy in pricing. In the year, starting at the end of 2002, Graham, this slide in 2003, HP decreased prices three times in Europe. So up to eight, 10, sometimes even 12%. So, as HP as the major driver and the market leader, everybody else has to follow, first one. Paper is the second one. Paper has increased in total up to 15%. In the United States, as far as I know, we have already seen paper increases in the last couple of months. We have not seen that in Europe yet. We know it will come and probably Germany first will be the first time we see slight increases. Just look at the dollar at this point in time and this is why HP decreased the prices to avoid the kind of shipping products from one side of the ocean to the other. If this continues, the strength of the dollar, they will further decrease prices in Europe, which would not be good, just from this perspective. Paper, I believe we will see some increases which certainly will help, but I can tell you were not counting on the price issue. We will create growth without the price impacting. OK, thank you very much. PRESENTATION Charlie Brown - Office Depot Inc. - EVP & CFO Good afternoon, I would like to correct something that my good friend Rolf said. I do that frequently. The country of Poland is not in Chapter 11, just to point that out, I dont want to have an incident. Our franchisee there is in Chapter 11. At any rate, if youre talking to me, you must be close to the end of our meeting. What I would like to do is first of all, thank you for your time, your insightful questions have been terrific. Sometimes I wish I had better answers for some of those questions. I would like to start also by introducing my team, I brought along some folks and hopefully you got a chance to meet them last evening. Ill start with Jim Walker. Jim is our Senior Vice President of Finance and Controller. Jim is, Ive known Jim for over 20 years, and hes been our Controller and been with Office Depot now for almost six years. And we have Carolyn Clark. Carolyn is our Vice President and Treasurer. So those folks here who would be the commercial banks will know Carolyn very well. And Carolyn came to us through the Viking merger and was treasurer there and has been treasurer and weve merged treasurer for Office Depot so its terrific. In the back is Jamie Gould, hes already been introduced once, he gets the pleasure of being introduced twice. He supports Rolf but I claim him as well as our CFO for the international business. 49 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting And then last but not least we have Sean McHugh who arranged this meeting and I think has done an absolutely terrific job. I think I only need one of these. Most of my colleagues have started their presentations with a summary of so whats different. And for me, Ill do the same. And actually Ill refer to a quote by one of our colleagues who hasnt spoken today and thats Frank Scruggs. Frank is our EVP of Human Resources who very insightfully at a board meeting last summer, to our board said, if you cant see it in the numbers, it didnt happen. So pretty good for an HR guy. So anyway, let me take you through, first of all, our performance this year and a little guidance for next year. This year were going to be north of $13 million, probably $13 billion, $13.5 probably. The big drivers in that ramp up obviously, you have the Guilbert, we had five months of Guilbert this year that we didnt have last year. You have the ramp up in stores. Last year we opened 33 stores, this year were going to open 80. So the (inaudible) reflected that, has pushed us up, so were going to be up over $1 billion. In terms of operating profit, were going to be essentially flat with 02 but an improvement over 03. Really, youve heard some of the reasons for that change. Our retail business will probably end up, even though theyve mixed down on a percentage basis because of the mix in the technology traffic, we talked about that today. So operating profit is going to end up the year, probably 25 to 30 basis points. So a nice turnaround in the retail business. We have had some erosion in Cindys business, largely as a result of going after some of the larger accounts. And international has had a positive contribution through the addition of Guilbert as well, so thats kind of the sources. So its kind of a mixed bag in terms of the profitability performance. EPS this year, Ill do a little quick math here, last year, 03 was impacted to the tune of about $0.08 by the adoption of EITF 02-16. Hopefully this will be the last time Ill ever have to use that phrase. But if you dump that $0.08 into 03, takes it to $0.96. So were going to be up about 10% year over year in a somewhat challenging sales environment. By the way, this range, $1.08 to $1.14, thats the range that we came out with in September, September 14th, and well be probably at the lower end of that range, rather than the higher end. And this does exclude all the various announcements that youve heard us make over the past six weeks regarding call centers, work force reductions, et cetera. Those are not included in that number. This is our CapEx for this year. You can see that its a significant increase in our investment in North American retail. That has essentially Kids RUs in it. It has 80 new stores, 12 re-los and 23 remodels. So thats a significant, just to our comparison, in 03, we had 33 new stores. The other couple of call outs would be the headquarters spending. Headquarters spending is up a little bit this year, thats mainly driven by the Magellan project, which Mark talked to you about earlier. And finally, the kind of light blue, which is BSG, youll notice has been a significant decrease in our investment as we continue to harvest some of the investments we made back in 00 and 01 which has allowed Dennis, Mark and the team to drive the kind of performance that Mark had talked about earlier today. And despite that increase in investment you can see their free cash flow. We define free cash flow as cash flow from operations minus CapEx. Its still fairly strong, fairly healthy and we expect this trend to continue into next year. Strong balance sheet, a number of you, number of my close friends out there who reminded me about how strong our balance sheet is, particularly when it comes to cash. Our balance sheet has a very strong current ratio. Its about the same as Staples. And debt is relatively low. Youll also note that we issued a press release on Friday, were taking that debt number down. Were calling a 10% high yield offering that we did back in 2001. So well call that. A couple reasons were doing that, one is that its a high yield offering so we had normal high yield covenants. This placed a number of restrictions on things we could do including share buy backs. The other reason for calling it is it improves our credit metrics. We really would like for the debtholders out there, we would like to see ourselves notched up to a higher grade from a rating agency perspective. 50 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting So again, overall, pretty strong balance sheet. This is probably the biggest, I think its because of my passion for RONA which hasnt yet, I think, come to its fruition; this is the biggest opportunity for us, is to drive RONA, RONA is an important metric to us. Youve heard us since, since Ive been the CFO of the company, is how important RONA is and how we drive that down to the lowest level of our business unit. Being able to take RONA, break it down into a metric that people, whether sitting in accounts payable or whether they are running a retail store can understand how they contribute to RONA. And that was what really led the increase from 00 to 02. The flattening out was really a function of two things. One, as you know in 03, stores made $100 million less in operating profit. We understand why that is and turning that around has been one of the sources of increased profitability by Rick and his team. But we also then have the Guilbert investment in there and as Rolf talked about earlier, its a nice performing business, but not performing at the level that we need to perform to drive return on net assets. So those were a couple reasons its flattened out. We look for that number to start to improve in 05. Returning to capital discipline. I think if you look at the chart and go back to 00 to 02, you can see that theres a lot of capital discipline, you could see the fact that we are starting to ramp up nicely and then it flattened out. And weve taken some pretty important decisions recently that we think will help that. One is the cancellation of the use of the new support center in South Florida. When someone asked me last night how are we determining what we invest in, I said its real easy, were going to put our money in things that actually give us a return. And a headquarters building, arguably, is not one of those things. We announced a $500 million share repurchase. A number of you also asked me privately about dividends. And thats under consideration. Again, weve had a very active dialog with our finance committee and Neil sits on our finance committee. He was the Chairman of our finance committee before this interim vacation that hes taking in South Florida. And so its been on the agenda for the better part of this year. And so well see. But the $500 million share repurchase we announced and were now actually executing against it. Probably not to the rate that makes everybody in this room happy, but we are committed to that program. Carefully evaluating the M2 remodel - this should not be construed as being negative on M2, quite frankly, even as a finance guy, Im quite bullish on M2. But I think we need to understand how it performs before we extend it to the change just for the sake of creating a consistent look and make sure that we understand its impact on operations, we can quantify that and test it. Weve announced the repurchase of the 10% senior subordinated notes. The other big opportunity in addition to RONA for us is our overall cost structure. And youre starting to see us get after that. We have a commitment to take those numbers down. Our plans, I can tell you right now, are being developed, specifically, say in the area of G&A, where each and every executive is being tasked with coming in to next year with a lower number than theyll exit this year, as opposed to in the past where there would typically be an increase because the business got bigger, the business got more complex. This focus on getting back to the few things that are going to drive shareholder value are going to allow us to take that down. And this is just a summation of some of those initiatives where, again, most of these, with the exception of the corporate support center, you will have seen in an 8K. The workforce rationalization that was announced on Friday, a $14 million charge in the fourth quarter, or $11 million in the fourth quarter, $3 million in 05, but with $26 million annual savings. Cindy talked about the call center consolidation which has at least a $15 million upside. 51 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting Support center, the $5 to $7 million annual savings going forward would be through staying at our existing campus and not having depreciation, some of the other costs associated with that new facility. And the notes will be a $40 million impact, again, you can look through that because the positive impact from forgoing that negative carry is about $14 million a year. So again, these are things that have all been announced. OK, there we go, thanks. OK, what this slide is and what this slide isnt. What this slide is not, is EPS guidance for next year that were going to commit to at this time. I think some of you understand the rationale, I think others will probably like for us to do the math for you. But were going to give you something to go on. But the reason for not committing at this point in time is Neil has only been here six weeks. And while hes done a lot in six weeks and he knows the business amazingly well for someone that hasnt been immersed in the business, hes not willing at this point in time to commit to a number. I think thats wise. I think its also wise not to commit because well have a new CEO coming in at some point in time and he may choose  he or she  may choose to run the business differently that were running it currently. So, at any rate, heres what were seeing in terms of plans for next year. Were expecting to open in North America 100 new stores. I think thats  has been previously communicated, so its entirely consistent. We expect low to mid single digit positive comps. BSG  mid single digit growth. I think if Cindy does a better job  a faster job. Sorry, Cindy, finance guys tend to be so black and white, I know. If she produces things more quickly, shall we say, in getting the sales force up and running, then there may be some upside there. But right now, its mid singles. In international, low to mid single. Again, part of its economic, part of its turning Guilbert around on the gross side. Operating margins, overall, are going to essentially be flat. Weve got some upside in North American Retail, offset by downsides in BSG and international. And then, of course, our commitment to start to get G&A leverage. Flat tax rate, 30% next year. Thats what its been this year. And CapEx in the 325-375 range. Thats down about $50 million. That also still has the 80 remodeled stores in that, which Im not sure well get to 80 remodeled stores, so that number may actually improve a little bit, be a little bit lower, which would then pump up the free cash flow. So, this is a slide that  very similar to ones that youve seen before with solid cash flow, solid balance sheet. Tend to be fairly good at our working capital management, thanks to guys like Mark and his team. Were committed to improving RONA through a combination of improved margins as well as continued discipline in how we spend our capital. We are confident in our future growth prospects. I think, hopefully, you take away from all the presentations today. I mean, its really kind of easy for me to step up  these guys have to earn the business every day. And I think you should take away a sense of confidence that they actually understand the levers in the business that they need to pull and are committed to pulling. So, with that, Ill take questions. Yes, Robert? QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Unidentified Participant (inaudible) Charlie Brown - Office Depot Inc. - EVP & CFO OK. Some things just never go away. Probably the  let me try it different. Rather than taking you to a number, in terms of ins and outs, let me talk to you about the process and whats left over, which is really what you ought to be concerned about. When we made the offer for the 124 Kids R Us units, we obviously had the locations  we took those and ran those through our side-by-side real estate process. That came up with sales estimates and, of course, we already had our margin operating assumptions that we applied against that. And that determined how much we could pay for these units. We then said, well, some of these units we dont want and we could go off and sell them and we did, like we announced the Kids R Us transaction. The units that were left that we were going to operate, what we said is what is the 52 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting  what is the excess purchase price that would be in those units that would take your return below our threshold. And when were looking at units, just as a guideline, we use a low-mid-teen threshold per unit. Thats the  its got to clear that hurdle rate. And so, when we took those units collectively and ran them against that hurdle rate, the excess purchase price, if you will, or the premium to get the entire portfolio of Kids R Us units to take these to the Northeast was $15-20 million. And so, what you have to believe then, in the analytics, is that through opening stores next year and the year after that, that you will spread that premium over those  and thats where you get the return. If you just did Kids R Us by itself, its not a good deal. But that excess premium, which I think is  if I were in your situation, Id be interested in how much did you pay that you cant recover through your normal operating model. Its about $15-20 million. Unidentified Participant Charlie  thank you. Charlie Brown - Office Depot Inc. - EVP & CFO Hey, Matt. Unidentified Participant Two questions  first, if you could just talk about the buyback. Any constraints to your ability to buy back stock, perhaps related to the high yield note and what do you think the change of the -- the pace of the buyback, rather, will change once that goes away. And then, secondly, if you could kind of connect the dots between some of the comments that we got on the different divisions and the operating margin forecast, specifically for BSG and international, where youre looking for operating margin declines in 2005. Just talk to the factors that are most decisive in driving that projection. Charlie Brown - Office Depot Inc. - EVP & CFO OK. In terms of the share buyback, the high yield covenants are not having an impact. They would have two years ago, three years ago. The way the negatives that make these covenants work is you started out with a small base and then you added to that as a percentage of your operating profit each quarter. And so, the 500 million is within that formula. So, were OK on that. The issue, in terms of the pace, is really a dialogue between Neil and myself and the finance committee. There is a reluctance on the part of the finance committee. They do believe that we need to return money, if were not using it, to the shareholders. They want to wait, so some extent, to see how the next quarter or two look in terms of the choppiness with some of the things that are going on, some decisions that were making. And I think, again, were in, were buying at a faster rate than we did under the old program. But I think we need to get a little more visibility before we commit to accelerating. But I think that there is a willingness to accelerate once we're through that period. The other question was around margins. I think that these numbers I showed you prove they're preliminary. I think the thing that's really driven Cindys margins has to do with the segment that they're going after which is the large national accounts which continue to have, it's a focus but they have lower margins. And then there's some cost increases. And the contract business as you receive cost increases your ability to rapidly pass those along is sometimes difficult. Having said that I know that Chuck and his team are working to help Cindy in that regard. 53 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting International, I think it's really more a function Rolf actually had the answer with some of the clients that we've seen. Paper, ink and toner in our international business is very very big part of that business. And therefore when HP takes average selling prices down it has a meaningful impact on our business. I don't know if Cindy, you or Rolf want to add to that. Charlie Brown - Office Depot Inc. - EVP & CFO Mr. Binder. Unidentified Participant Currency has played favorably for you the last couple years. How does that play into your projections for 05? Are you assuming mutual, or negative? Charlie Brown - Office Depot Inc. - EVP & CFO We'd assume the exchange rates that are below where the year's currently trading. Unidentified Participant You've assumed below this year. Charlie Brown - Office Depot Inc. - EVP & CFO Below, yes. Unidentified Participant (inaudible) Unidentified Participant A little bit? Unidentified Participant OK. Charlie Brown - Office Depot Inc. - EVP & CFO It's below the full year average. Yes sir. 54 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting Unidentified Participant I think that on the last conference call you might have said that the October retail business had actually strengthened. Is that still the case? You can just let us know what things are looking like for the holidays. Charlie Brown - Office Depot Inc. - EVP & CFO The only impact risk that we see in the holiday season currently is the one Chuck talked to earlier today, Chuck and Mark about the ports total merchandises arriving a little bit slower than what we would have liked. In terms of how comps are trending, comps are actually right in line with the guidance so these are the forecasts that I worry the least about. That frankly is the retail forecast. Yes. Unidentified Participant A point in your presentation you mentioned that you'd like to see your credit rating higher that where they are today. My first question is why would you like to see them higher? Second, would be over what period of time? And third, what ratios are you looking at, debt to CAP, leverage, free cash to debt. What are the next things that you're looking internally for and improving your credits ratings? Charlie Brown - Office Depot Inc. - EVP & CFO Well when I said I'd like to see our rating higher I didn't talk about how likely I think the court will be which I actually don't think it's going to be very likely. Until we have a new CEO in place and we have a better track record in terms of some of our, the sustainability of our performance. But I think, I'll look to Bill, I think it's in terms of coverage which is that it improves the particularly the interest coverage, it's a lot better. Yes. Unidentified Participant Regarding supplies, furniture and technology, the GMROI on those three areas, what is the difference in that and is that a criteria in terms of product areas that you've group with emphasize more emphasize less? Charlie Brown - Office Depot Inc. - EVP & CFO That's a negative that we don't disclose, however I think you've got the essence of it in terms of Chuck and his dialog around the earned space model. Earned space model applies to more than just the catalog insert. It has to do with also space in the warehouse etcetera so we are very very focused on that as a metric but we don't release that number. Unidentified Participant I assume the technology turns faster. What's the fastest turn here if you know the story? 55 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting Charlie Brown - Office Depot Inc. - EVP & CFO Mark, do you want to talk to that? Mark Holifield - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, Supply Chain (inaudible) Charlie Brown - Office Depot Inc. - EVP & CFO Paper or some of the supply categories are actually the fastest in terms of SKUs. It's those consumables that flow through. I mean when we buy paper, we buy it by the boxcar, trainloads of paper. I don't know where we stand on the scale, are we the largest seller of paper? Unidentified Participant (inaudible-away from mic) Chuck Rubin - Office Depot Inc. - EVP, Marketing & Merchandizing There are differences between the segments within each of those three, so everything that Charlie said is accurate but at the same time our PC turnover is also very quick. And as I mentioned earlier in my comments that the inventory management team has done a really good job of controlling that exposure on end of life inventory (inaudible-two voices) Charlie Brown - Office Depot Inc. - EVP & CFO In terms of the technology on store we hold very little at the store or we use a replenishment model to give us the supplies so that we can turn. I mean you're turning, if you have three units obviously I mean you're turning very very quickly. Unidentified Participant Is return on inventory investment, is there minimum standard required to carry a particular product or categories the products? Charlie Brown - Office Depot Inc. - EVP & CFO I'll let Chuck who makes those decisions. The question was Chuck, is there a minimum threshold that a product has to meet in GMROI to meet the assortment (ph) ? (inaudible-away from mic) What Chuck said was that GMROI is only one metric. There are others but it is one of the things that we look at. Sometimes just logically you have to have certain things to go with to have a complete assortment that basically may not have the GMROI that the principal product would have.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting Unidentified Participant You mentioned early on that you're more on the lower end of the 108 to 114 range but you also mentioned that retail's doing quite fine, it's in (inaudible) of the range. So what is causing(inaudible, coughing) the lower end? Charlie Brown - Office Depot Inc. - EVP & CFO It will be the other two pieces of our business. Don't ask me those kind of hard questions Gary. Europe has been soft, surprisingly soft in the last couple months especially August and September. We are seeing nice (inaudible) improvement and Europe in October. But as I'm fond of telling Rolf, one swallow doesn't a spring make. Unidentified Participant I'm just trying to understand the disconnect between your projection, I know, it's kind of early on for next year but you were saying that North America to become marginally (ph) to be up 20 basis point but Rick says he's hoping that will be flat. I'm just wondering what the disconnect is between what you're saying and what he's saying? Maybe he's being more conservative than you are? Charlie Brown - Office Depot Inc. - EVP & CFO Rick's actually, it's a difference in the quantitative methods used. I use models, Rick used the back of the envelope. I knew he'd get me in trouble on that. I think what Rick is really saying in all fairness, is that going into the northeast is new territory for us, we think we've got the supply chain. We think we've got the real-estate team. We have the sites. But we're just now, we've opened three stores, that have been open for three weeks. And the balance of this year we're going to open a whole lot more stores. I think what Rick is really saying, practically speaking without getting too fine an edge on it, it's likely that the competitive response will be intense. And so therefore the losses may be larger on those stores than what we normally see. What he wants to do is as an operator and I applaud this is say look, I'm not going to basically use that as an excuse, not to get my number. So his number, I would take it as a commitment, I take it as directional. So that's really the difference. Unidentified Participant Charlie. The way I understand it, I think you actually now own G & A. So I wondered about, you might want to take the opportunity here to talk maybe not about next year where I guess you're now softly committing to 30 basis points. But in terms of maybe a longer term commitment, how much are you willing to step up to the plate here in terms of what's possible on a G & A line? And what opportunities to do see in terms of G& A other than head count reduction which you've already taken a first step at? Charlie Brown - Office Depot Inc. - EVP & CFO Well I think that if you want to look long term, I think that our G&A currently is bumping up against 5% of sales totally. The biggest piece of that and where it's grown most rapidly has been in Europe. And part of the Guilbert acquisition. So I think the off the first tee, one of the years where we have the biggest opportunity. And it's going to be lead by systems integration, warehouse integration, those kind of things will be in Europe, OK, to take the number down because rate of growth 57 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting in the U.S. has been considerably lower although not necessarily acceptable. But certainly lower than the rate of growth in Europe and we knew this. And so part of the synergies and Guilbert valuation model was saying, Viking has always had an approach of building the capacity before they built sales. Now that were folding in Guilbert, we were able to get better volume, now we need to integrate Guilbert to get global G&A down. I think investors also look at a lot of the various infrastructure projects that we spend money on. So for example I didn't make very much a great big deal about it. Cindy talked about outsourcing her individual reps for her call center. I at the same time launched a pilot of going to outsource the credit collection team, in Wichita. Again retaining inside the company the decision about to whom we grant credit and how we manage credit. But the follow-up calls that go to customers which is where most of the head count is, I'm running a test to outsource that. So I think you're going to see us get much smarter and the things that we choose to own versus the things that we outsource. And if this test is a success in Wichita it'll save me a million dollars in my budget next year. A million dollars is not a lot but taking G & A is a lot of singles. So I think it's going to be a variety of things of that nature Colin. But the first place we're going to focus I think in terms of the highest invest return is working with my friend Rolf in Europe. Unidentified Participant Can you talk a little bit about targeting capital structure over time, once there is a new CEO in place? How much cash do you then think you'll need to have on the balance sheet? And will it be fair to say a year from now with the initiatives in place for awhile depending on priorities, which there's no need for the cash for the balance sheet. Charlie Brown - Office Depot Inc. - EVP & CFO And I think I actually misspoke when I was talking to you earlier today and I said that our cash would grow a little bit next year. That's incorrect. I went back and checked the model. Between our CAPEX plans currently, share repurchase, the debt repurchase, we will be seeing that cash balance start to come down. Ultimately Neil and I haven't invested very much time in talking about where it should be ultimately, it needs to be lower than where it's at. And the actions that we've already announced, we'll take it down. If we were to announce a dividend, I'm not saying that we're going to, again that will be another lever to return value to our shareholders. So that's about a specific as I can be at this time. Unidentified Participant I'm just following up, do you think you're going to get away that easy. Charlie Brown - Office Depot Inc. - EVP & CFO Oh, no. 58 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting Unidentified Participant Can you quantify how much of the Magellan expenses have flowed through to G % A line to date as that project will be coming to a close in the end of 2005? How much of a positive impact will that have in 2006 and beyond? Charlie Brown - Office Depot Inc. - EVP & CFO I think that the Magellan spending the majority of it has been capitalized. OK, 75% capitalized and so that's why you saw it in the CAPEX number, not in the P & L. And it will flow through the P& L. We tend to depreciate our major IT investments over five years. And so it's going to have a meaningful impact of a couple of pennies, for depreciation perspective. (inaudible-two voices). Unidentified Participant Is it in the corporate, is in the G&A line? Charlie Brown - Office Depot Inc. - EVP & CFO We didn't start depreciating, at least we didn't some of the modules and that's going to be in the G & A line. OK, if there are no more questions Ryan, I'll just turn it back over to Neil who will answer the really hard questions. Neil Austrian - Office Depot Inc. - Chairman, CEO Let me try and if I can just summarize a few things that you've heard today. And maybe a way to try and do it that's helpful to me, maybe to use (inaudible) What's going to be different next year than this year or next year than the past years. Maybe break it down organizationally first and then look at some other tactic or focus issues. The first is accountability, we've beaten that, it's a dead horse. I hope at lunch or at the break you had a chance to talk to the people who are accountable. It's clearly thought that ownership at this point, and that's been our name in effect I think for quite some time. With the fact that the marketing and merchandising organizations report that Chuck is a real plus. It'll start to see I think some real synergies next year. We have I think from my perspective as a board member major problems with those businesses being separated. In the last five years we have four different heads of merchandizing, four different heads of marketing, obviously that does not lead to really terrific results for decision making. Frank Scruggs is working with all of our key executives to come up with a new compensation system that we can put in next year throughout the company that literals (ph) link to the drivers of profitability in the units so that everybody in the company is focused on exactly the same thing. A real big change I thinks that a difference with the exception of Chuck, when the company knew it since he was here basically working on a consulting project. This is the same management team rolling into next year for the first time in five years. And to me that's a huge plus. This is an organization that was ready for change. Theyve embraced change, they wanted change. I haven't had to ram anything down anybody's throat. When you look at the focus for next year, Chuck started it off, it's going to be customer centric not channel centric. That's a big difference. We're also not schizophrenic any more in terms of who our customer is. It's pretty clear who our customer is. It's a business customer. 59 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting Focus on attachments and supplies. You've heard a lot about the cost reductions. We're going to begin to see for the first time some Magellan results. Other big difference after a 15, 16, 18 quarters. It's the first time we're entering the next year with positive retail counts. We've got lower cost structure going into next year. It's going to be the first time in a long time that we've really added to our score count. It's going to be the first time since 99 as Cindy said that we added to the sales force in BSG. All of these things to me say that next year has to be better than this year. There's no way it can't and there's no way it won't. At the same time I'm very very reluctant to give guidance because I don't have a good enough grasp, I have to tell you want happens quarter to quarter. I think Charlie has given you enough indications, certainly I have, I'd be happy to answer questions. When the board asked me to do this, part of the difficulty I had in accepting it was my own genetic make up. I'm not a caretaker. In talking with the board I asked, what do you idiots expect me to do? It's a short period of time, maybe a long period of time. I'm not going to be a caretaker and they said do what you think is the right thing to do. Run it like you'd run the business on a permanent basis. The interesting (ph) one is part of the question that one of you asked me is, are you sure what you're doing is what a new CEO would want you to do because somebody new is going to be coming in here in several months. In thinking about it I said do what am I doing it, I mean might not want me to do it. Let's look at the Northeast deal. You made a decision just eight months ago to acquire the KRU package real estate portfolio that would get us in the northeast. Even if I didn't want to do it, which I do, it would have been lunacy after having paid that money not to open the store where I had those leases. So a new CEO coming in (inaudible) is going to have to continue that program and probably should. He can slow it down but you better open all the KRU stores. New stores, why wouldn't a person want to open new store. Why wouldn't that person if the financial models suggest you can earn an attractive return on invested capital. And we've got a program in place now where retail and finance talk all the time. It's pretty clear the only places we're going to open stores is where we get a return on invested capital. And in looking at it that way when you defend a market you look at what the decision might be if you didn't defend versus defending. Sell off Guilbert. It drives me crazy. You wouldn't hire that guy as a CEO. And it goes absolutely to the wrong decision given the dominance we're going to have in Europe and the kind of cash flow and earnings we can expect out of Europe. You look at the organizational pieces that we've changed. There's an awful lot of organizations in the retailing business where marketing and merchandising are together. I got serious doubts that that decision which actually was made before I got here, will be one that anybody would undertake at this point. There are far too many issues, other issues you have to deal with. Accountability, the new person ought to be thankful that he or she is not the last person that has to deal with that issue. 60 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

NOVEMBER 15, 2004 / 2:00PM, ODP.OQ - 2004 Investor Meeting Cost reductions, we're doing somebody a favor. The call center decisions, it's not irrevocable. You hear Cindy talk about the fact that the voice of the customers we have right now is telling us we've used these same people to outsource in the past. I can't see a problem. It's also not a irreversible decision. It's being done here domestically. Canceling the corporate headquarters building, Ill let somebody else try to convince the board we ought to spend 140 million dollars. I'm sure not going to do that. They're looking at where the business is today, but from my perspective yes it's six weeks. I spent six years on the board. It's probably in the best position it's been in going into the next year in terms of what the platform is. Where we stand in the search process. The day that I agreed to undertake this job I told the board I'd like to hire Heidrick and Struggles as the search firm. And the reason why is that I've know Jerry Roach (ph) for over 40 years. Jerry's the rainmaker in that organization. He's the person that was the former CEO. And they put a team together of Roach, Tim Jadic (ph) who's the Vice Chairman, Melanie Pierson (ph) who's their retail expert, John Thompson who runs their west coast office. From the four of them is a team. I asked the board to put a committee together of board members who were committed, who had the time, who understood our business to be part of the search committee. Team chaired by Brenda Gaines who is best chairman and CEO of Dinners Club, Lee Ault who ran Telecredit for 25, 30 years sits on the board of Equifax , Scott Hedrick who's a venture capitalist to really he's a majority owner of Office Club before Office Depot deal and myself. I think between the four of us, we've interviewed an awful lot of people throughout our careers. The process would be at some point in the next week to two weeks we'll receive some thoughts from Heidrick and Struggles in terms of people that they think we ought to be seriously interest in. We will then meet, either reach us prior or after Thanksgiving with piece that Heidrick and Struggles so to that list Ron (ph) and I will sit down as best we can just from looking at paper an begin interviewing people. David Bernauer has agreed that he'll be my consultant, since he certainly knows the retail business. And at point when we get to having reduced the applicant pool of potential pool down I will get David and Bob to help with one or two other board members. It's really my expectation that by the end of the first quarter of 2005 we would have hopefully a new Chief Executive in place here at the company. I want to thank you as Charlie said for coming today. I hope it's been useful. We appreciate you taking the time. Hopefully it's given you a chance to see that this is a company that truly is committed, has an awful lot of management depth. It's a management team that's absolutely committed to making this work. And from my perspective I'm committed to staying here until we find the right person to turn the company over to. So with that I'm happy to answer any other questions that we haven't been able to answer today. Unidentified Participant Thank you for today. During this period of transition have you and the board pursued other alternatives i.e. the sale of Office Depot? Neil Austrian - Office Depot Inc. - Chairman, CEO Absolutely not, and I say that very quickly because I think there's a clear sense that the board have, certainly that I have in the last six weeks. At this point in time where there's so much up side to this company that to sell the company today would really be, I think a sin for the current shareholders and those that have been in the company for a period of time. Unidentified Participant Thanks again and we appreciate it and if there's any further question give us a shout. 61 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

Actual results may differ materially from those stated in any forward-looking statement based on a number of important factors and risks, which are more specifically identified in the companies' most recent SEC filings. Although the companies may indicate and believe that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate or incorrect and, therefore, there can be no assurance that the results contemplated in the forward-looking statements will be realized. THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN EVENT TRANSCRIPTS IS A TEXTUAL REPRESENTATION OF THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S CONFERENCE CALL AND WHILE EFFORTS ARE MADE TO PROVIDE AN ACCURATE TRANSCRIPTION, THERE MAY BE MATERIAL ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR INACCURACIES IN THE REPORTING OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE CONFERENCE CALLS. IN NO WAY DOES THOMSON REUTERS OR THE APPLICABLE COMPANY ASSUME ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS MADE BASED UPON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED ON THIS WEB SITE OR IN ANY EVENT TRANSCRIPT. USERS ARE ADVISED TO REVIEW THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S CONFERENCE CALL ITSELF AND THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S SEC FILINGS BEFORE MAKING ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS. ©2020, Thomson Reuters.
