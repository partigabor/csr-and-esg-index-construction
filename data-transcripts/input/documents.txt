CONFERENCE CALL PARTICIPANTS EILEEN DUNN BRUCE NELSON TRANSCRIPT Editor Operator Hello and welcome to the Office Depot mid-quarter update. I would like to introduce Miss Eileen Dunn, Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations, who will make a few opening comments. Miss Dunn, you may begin. EILEEN DUNN Good morning. Welcome to our mid-quarter update for the fourth quarter, 2001. Before Bruce makes his comments, let me remind you that except for historical information, the matters discussed in this taped message are forward-looking within the meanings of the Product Securities Litigation Reform Act. Forward-looking statements including projections and anticipated levels of future performance involve risks and/or uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed herein. These risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time by Office Depot and are filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which include and without limitation our 10 K's and 10-Q's. You are strongly urged to review such files for a more detailed discussion of such risks and uncertainties. Now, let me transfer this call over to Bruce Nelson, Office Depot's CEO. BRUCE NELSON Thanks Eileen. Thanks to everyone who is dialed in to listen to our business outlook for the fourth quarter which ends December 29, 2001. In a brief summary since we reported our third quarter results on October 17th, North America retail sales trends have somewhat improved via [unintelligible] sales particularly to our large contract customers have softened, and international sales and local currencies have held steady. As we previously stated, overall sales trends continue to be negatively impacted by a week domestic economic environment. However I am pleased to say that our 48,000 worldwide employees are continuing to find new ways to drive sales, manage and control costs, and increase shareholder returns. I continue to be encouraged by our consistently improving operating performance across all business segments. I will now make some brief comments about fourth quarter trends in each of our three reported business segments. First North America retail. Comparable retail sales so far in this quarter has slightly improved over third quarter trends, and the forecast we gave when we reported our third quarter results. Comp sales in October were in line with our estimate of high single digit negative growth, but we saw a nominal improvement in our sales trends for most of November. However, sales trends on the Friday, Saturday and Sunday after Thanksgiving were somewhat disappointing and mirrored the trends we have experienced all year. Which is weaker sales trends on weekends compared to sales during the week when most of our core small to medium size business customers shop. We believe this reflects the same weakness in consumer spending that we have seen throughout 2001. Technology and furniture rated categories continue to underperform while our core office supply business remains steady. We now anticipate compareable North America retail sales for the fourth quarter will finish in the negative 6 to 7% comp range. Which would be a modest improvement over the range we gave on our third quarters earnings call last month. On the gross margin side we are projecting gross margin improvement on a year over year basis but below third quarter levels as a result of fourth quarter merchandise mix changes, nd somewhat lower annual volume rebates from suppliers as our overall 2001 sales growth. We continue to keep tight control over expenses while at the same time improving virtually all of our customer service measurements. Turning to business services group. In our contract business, we continue to see sales negatively impacted by the weakening economy and employee layoffs in our large customer segment. In fact, contract sales have shown a further softness from our forecast last month as large businesses, in particular, have accelerated layoffs and are controlling expenses even more aggressively. Our catalog and E-Commerce businesses have been less impacted and continue to show positive growth. As a result, if current trends continue in this segment, we think fourth 2 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

NOVEMBER 28, 2001 / 1:00PM, ODP.OQ - Office Depot Mid-Quarter Business Update quarter compareable sales growth could decline to the mid-single digit negative range for this group. BSG growth margins continue benefit from disciplined contract pricing but will also be negatively impacted by somewhat lower supplier rebates as a result of softer sales performance. We continue to see improvement in productivity and efficiency somewhat offset by a lack of leverage in warehouse and delivery fleet fixed costs. Total BSG operating costs as a percentage of sales are forecasted to be well below last year's level, continuing the improvement we have shown all year. Interestingly, the number of customers orders is rising, total lines are increasing but average ticket is declining. We are growing the number of new customers, increasing our retention of existing customers but they are buying fewer units. We see these as continued signs of a deteriorating and difficult short-term economic environment. On the international front, quarter to date sales and local currencies in our international division have continued to hold steady with strength returning to Germany one of our largest European revenue companies. At this stage in the quarter we still believe sales in U.S. dollars will be in the low double digit range for the fourth quarter. Currency while somewhat neutral in the early part of the quarter has now returned to its negative partern of earlier in the year with the Euro dropping to the mid to high 80s and the British pound hovering around the 140's range which will negatively impact the reported sales in dollars. Our highly profitable international division continues to grow faster than the European economies generally, and remains in full control over selling margins and operating costs. We are on target to begin operations in Switzerland in early 2002 and will soon announce our entry into another new European country later in 2002. International continues to be the highest growth potential of all of our businesses and we intend to continue to invest in this high return on investment segment. To summarize our retail business is showing sequential improvement in comps for the third consecutive quarter, and total company growth margins continue to improve on a year over year basis. Our international business, while still plagued by currency issues remains a constant, steady performer.

Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO Thank you, John. I'm going to just briefly comment on the income statement. And then turn it over to Jim Andrasick to talk about cash flow balance sheet and other related issues. We did expect as we've noted publicly prior to this a poor first quarter at Matson and that's basically what happened. We did perform slightly better than our plan both at Matson and at A&B and Aggregate for the quarter. We are forecasting results to improve for A&B in the next quarter and for the remainder of the year. Let me first talk about Matson and talk about where we're going. First, we had deferred because of difficult economic circumstances in Hawaii, a rate increase that we would normally put into effect earlier in the year. We have announced a rate increase and it was effective April 14th at 2.75 percent. And that should help us as we forward in the year. I would also note second that we have just announced an increase in the fuel surcharge from 3.25 to 4.75 percent. There's a relatively unstable situation I'm sure as you know in the are of oil prices. We averaged $17 per barrel during the first quarter of this year. However, the last stop at the gas pump so to speak was at $26. We don't expect that it's going to stay at that level, but nonetheless there has been a very significant increase in oil prices recently. I would also just note, that on the positive side that volume trends at Matson are up. January and February were both quite weak, but March was better and April is starting our pretty well. In terms of the two components of our freight package, containers are doing pretty well which is most of our business, but the auto business that you will note commented in the report, it was down 23 percent year over year our shipment of autos. And that is still relatively soft. So those are just some top line things that are happening at Matson. I would also just for your information, note that we have implemented a reduction in the vessel serving Hawaii from eight to seven in January. We'll get the full benefit of that in the second quarter. If our cargo volume does return later on in the year, we may go back up to eight vessels, but for the moment we're down to a seven vessel fleet to Hawaii. We're seeing increased productivity at our Sand Island Terminal in Hawaii. I would characterize it as better but not good enough. Still a drag on Matson's performance. There are improvements that are occurring. The efficiencies are getting better, but we still have a way to go there. And that's going to be another area where we should expect to see improvement in both our efficiencies and our cost structure as the year goes along. Other than that, I would just finally note for Matson that we also expect to see gains at our affiliate for the rest of the year which should help our income. Just to summarize, we did have a very touch fourth quarter, a difficult first quarter. We expect that there will be some substantial improvement in the second quarter and beyond at Matson. And we're certainly working very hard to make that happen. In the real estate business basically everything is at or above our plans for 2002. I can say that just for prospective purposes that we've had 10 years of never having missed a plan in real estate. So I think that business is going to do pretty much what we think it's going to do for the year. In the leasing area, commercial properties, there's been some softness in occupancy, but again we've anticipated that. We expect that as the year goes along we'll probably see some pick ups there. We had a very good property sales quarter compared to a great sales quarter that we had last year, but it will still very good. We sold and industrial property portfolio in Dallas and a number of small Hawaii properties in the quarter. 3 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

APRIL 18, 2002 / 7:00PM, - Q1 2002 Alexander&Baldwin Earnings Conference Call The only area where there's a little bit of weakness is in some of the resort development activities that we have in Hawaii. If you've go a resort project and it's basically in a launch or a sale at least up phase things are slow, but that represents a small component of our capital in the neighborhood of about, 6, 7 percent of the total capital that's in the business. So it's a relatively small exposure but there are some short term reductions in meeting some of our objectives there but it's certainly containable. In the food products area the investment there is principally our sugar plantation on Maui. We have a residual, small interest now of about $12 million or so in C&H sugar refinery in California, but it's mostly the agricultural business on Maui in sugar. Sugar prices have dropped recently. However, we've priced forward about 14 percent of our crops so far at pretty good prices. We'll see what happens to the rest of the group as the year goes on. We think that prices will probably firm. But we're also no in the business of projecting commodity prices all that well either. I would say on a positive note, that the farming bill which is sort of the structure under which our sugar business operates, the expectation is quite positive. And high that there will be a renewal of farm legislation which will provide stability and probably a little bit of an improved pricing environment for sugar over a number of years in the future. It's still caught up in Congress right now, but that will probably be passed some time in the next few months. In terms of the company's development and acquisition activity. We continue to work on several large projects and activities. We are getting close to a decision on what would be the purchase of two vessels that are being constructed for our container operations to Hawaii. We're not quite there yet but we're relatively close to a decision on that. This would be in excess as we've noted before of $100 million per vessel but not too much in excess of $100 million per vessel if we were to make that decision. We are also expecting to complete, and when we do, announce a longer term real estate development venture with a partner in Hawaii. On the acquisition front, it's been publicly reported in Hawaii that Victoria Ward has reached an agreement to sell. We were apart of the process. We were not ultimately the party that they decided to go forward with. And partly, I guess that was because the price go to a point where we were not comfortable that it was a good investment for Alexander & Baldwin. There's a tendency to sometimes chase things beyond a point where it makes good economic sense, so we pushed away from the table at a point in the process. And it appears the General Growth will be owner of the Victoria Ward portfolio in Honolulu. We are also involved in some other acquisition activity which we're not able to really comment on at this time, but we're quite active in looking for value driven investments for the company. So with that, I would just make two final points. One, we've had a - there's an accounting change that has occurred which has not changed in any material way the results of the company, but it has changed in some respects how we report these results in real estate and Jim Andrasick will talk about that in a moment. I would also note that John Kelley is going to talk about the economy of Hawaii. And it certainly looks like the projections are getting much, much better. In fact, the gross product for the states there's been quite an optimistic upward adjustment to what the economic circumstances are for Hawaii for the remainder of the year. And John will comment on that. So with that, I'll turn it over to you Jim. Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - Senior Vice Presidnt, CFO Thank you very much, Allen. First, if I can just turn to the P&L on page five and comment on a couple of items. The treasury environment, of course is very favorable. If I could just point out on the interest expense line we are down 2.8 million in expenses, which is about 50 percent from the prior year's quarter. And we've had a following wind on this on rates as everyone is aware all year long. 4 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

APRIL 18, 2002 / 7:00PM, - Q1 2002 Alexander&Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Our average rate for the first quarter of 2002 is 4.2 percent. That's on all borrowings, fixed in floating, compared to a prior year's quarter of 6.6 percent. And about half of this is a result of the reduction in expense was lower volumes, $85 million in lower average balances and about half was due to rate. So good performance there. On the corporate expense line we're down 800,000. We had a non reoccurrence this year of the charitable contribution of stock in 2001, as well as about 300,000 in absolute reductions in G&A which the result of various management initiatives to control cost. Let me add, the income tax line, and I know many of you haven't probably taken the effect rate or computed that, but you will know that last year's first quarter we used an effective rate of 35.5 percent. This year, it's up to 38 percent. That's a pretty large increase, so I thought I would comment on that. Part of it is the result of not taking some large charitable deductions for low basis stock that was contributed last year. Part of it is a dividend received deduction that we got on investments last year which will not - since we have sold those investments, that will not reoccur. And also we had a roll off of various low income housing and tax credits late in 2001, which will not reoccur in 2002. At least we're not projecting that they will. I need to comment as Alan said on discontinued operations because for presentation purposes we have broken out properties and agriculture separately. And as our press release stated, the new standard of accounting for disposal of long lived assets now treats the sale of certain income producing assets, even individual building as discontinued operations if their earnings and cash flows are separately identifiable and they're material to results. I think, as everyone recognizes, the standards of materiality have gone down considerably, both in the SEC's eyes and public accounting eyes. We had two sales in the first quarter that qualified under these rules and that contributed 4.3 million which was treated on an after tax basis. And we've attempted to continue to give you information in the revenue and operating profit lines which shows comparable year performance and treated these discontinued operations as a deduct from both revenue and operating profit. But this will have an effect on our property sales activities going forward. In that we will have to declare in advance properties that maybe put up for sale and have buyers identified. The other thing I would point out is that in this first quarter's activity, the proceeds from those land sales sold about 30 million. You can see that as the deduction from revenues. And all of those monies were held in escrow pending reinvestment in qualified 10-31 replacement properties which has been A&B's long standing practice. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flows, really there were only three events that explain most of the account changes in the first quarter beyond the normal ebb and flow of seasonal working capital changes. The first was a payment of $38 million tax bill, U.S. federal tax bill which - in the first quarter which was the result of our bank stock sale late last year. This reduced current liabilities and of course impacted operating cash flow. Another event was the sale by Matson of two vessels to a minority affiliate. These ships had been under charger to that affiliate with an option to buy. That option was exercised. And at year end 2001 those vessels had been held in current assets for disposition. The cash proceeds of about 16 million from that sale were contributed to the capital construction fund which closed that account balance . And finally the third event, as I previously noted is property sales. That reduced the property net account by about $25 million. And the cash proceeds were placed in escrow for reinvestment which is carried in other assets that in term explains the $30 million increase in that account. Overall results was a net requirement to borrow about 44 million against that revolving credit facilities and which is shown in the increase in debt, and also as a source of funds and cash flow. 5 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

APRIL 18, 2002 / 7:00PM, - Q1 2002 Alexander&Baldwin Earnings Conference Call I would just comment on two other areas. Capital expenditures as shown in the cash flow were down considerable year-over-year. We spent 8.2 million in the first quarter. And most of the decline was at Matson where we have either - we have deferred equipment purchases and throttled back consistent with our earnings performance. The second point would be on, which we discussed at our last call, is on pension credits and debits. In prior years, the company has reported income from it's over funding in effect of it's pension obligation. That over funding continues - continues through the first quarter. However, it's not at the same level as previous years. And that in tern results in a lower level of pension credits year over year. So last year we picked up about six to seven million in favorable income pre tax. This year, we're projecting about break even to one million. So those credits which are none cash impact on earnings will decline. I would just make a final comment if I may on transparency. A&D has no special purpose entities. The full extent of our guarantees and other commitments is disclosed in our annual reported and in the 10-k on page 24 just as a reference. But let me just quickly restate what our position is. We do have letters of credit out standing and performance bonds. At year end 2001, those totaled about 26 million, that's been reduced to 22 million as a result of the release of various performance bonds against real estate projects. And we do guarantee the debt of two affiliate companies in the aggregate 46.5 million at year end 2001. That is unchanged at quarter end. So we finally report the company continues to be in excellent financial health. And with that, I will turn it to John Kelley. John Kelley - Alexander & Baldwin - Vice President of Investor Relations Thanks, Jim. In the all important psychologically as well as from a solid economic point of view visitor industry trends continue to improve. I think many of you have read some articles in the eastern press noting that mainland visitors are back nearly to normal, that is pre 9-11 levels. But visitors from Japan or other from other international areas continue to lag. In the January and February numbers which came out since our last call, the total number of arrivals were down 16.5 percent in January and about 9 percent in February. The March numbers aren't out yet. And if you split those in January, people on domestic sights were down 8.4 percent, and in February they are two-tenths of 1 percent. So a good trend there. International arrivals were down 28.8 percent in January. And now they've improved the decline of 24.7 percent by February. In the visitor days that is the more relevant economic measure that dwells high in the economic contribution, in January visitor days were down about 13 percent and that had come up to a decline of just 5 percent in February. If you look at the most recent period in the seven days ending the ninth of April, which is the most recent domestic data available, domestic rivals were at 91 percent of prior comparable period levels. And looking just at Japan in the seven days ending the 10th of April, Japanese travelers were at 82 percent of their prior year level and that's down from a 95 percent level they'd reached earlier in the month. So the domestic travelers continue to show strength. Japan continues to lag, but the improvement is gratifying. In terms of Hawaii's own economic measures, some of the leading indicators and other things we've talked about are still not reflecting all of the improvements. There's a lot of noise in the data. But if you look at some of the physical factors that drive demand and provide visitors, airline seats are probably one of the most noteworthy. And the employee visitor and convention bureau reported the other day that there are about 400, 000 new seats have been announced in calendar year '02. And that's in addition to about almost 190,000 seats that have been restored since suspensions following 9-11. And particularly - in particular Hawaiian airlines announced direct service to Ontario, California and Sacramento, and in October they'll be starting direct service to Phoenix. So some of the air carriers here are reaching out to mainland destinations. In addition, the more traditional carriers like united, just announced two weekly Denver to Honolulu non stops. And in June they're going to add two - a second domestic flight from San Francisco direct to Konan, the big island, with a 757. 6 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

APRIL 18, 2002 / 7:00PM, - Q1 2002 Alexander&Baldwin Earnings Conference Call In addition to American airlines in mid June it's going to add daily service, a second daily flight from Los Angeles direct to the island of Kauai. So I think what's happening is that the demands, especially from the mainland is being read loud and clear in the airline industry and they're responding. On the economic front, unemployment levels in Hawaii are improving slightly. February's most recent data available it's 4.7 percent unemployment rate. That was a slight improvement from 4.8 in January and five in December. Hawaii continues to look better on that measure than the U.S. February for the U.S. of course was 6.1 percent. I think if you step back from the numbers, let me read you a short overview from a set of economists at the university of Hawaii. I think this more or less says it all. And these guys are as an unbiased as you can get from the academic point of view. Headline is brief recession likely over. And they go on to say "outside of tourism, the state has weathered the current slow down fairly well. Job losses have been significant but the labor markets appears to have turned the corner. Hawaii will likely experience only a mild and short lived recession in real personal income with year over year growth resuming in the second quarter of '02. Economic recovery will strengthen as the year proceeds." And they go on in the article to say there are really only two significant risk factors, one is uncertainty over the state of economics affairs in Japan. And the second of course is the unrest in the Middle East, which could trip a lot of things going the other direction. And when you take these things together, the present forecast for visitor arrivals by the state agency responsible projections is for an improvement of 3.5 percent in 2002. And that follows the decline of 9 percent in 2001. On the personal income front, the state's projecting about a 1.3 percent real increase in personal income in '02. And that's an improvement over their prior figures. And in their real gross state product projection there, now as Allen stated 1.7 percent for '02. And then 2 percent and around 2 percent thereafter in '03. And that contrasts with about 1.4 percent projected for the actuals in 2001. So I think we're looking at relatively modest economic growth, but you've got to take into account that we've got one weak quarter in '02. So those numbers actually reflected fairly rapid and reasonably strong turnaround. I think the fact is from an operating leverage point of view that's exactly the kind of environment we can flourish in. So with that, I'd like to step back from our monologue if you will and open it to questions-and-answers. So operator if you would explain the ground rules for using the phones for Q&A. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Operator Certainly, sir. Thank you very much, Mr. Kelley. For those of you who have a question that was one-four on your touch-tone phone at this time. Now, please keep in mind, that if you're using a speakerphone, you must pick up your handset to press one-four to register in our question-and-answer line up. Once again, for those of you who have questions, please press one four on your touch-tone phone now. Thank you very much, sir. And it looks like our first question is going to come from a Mr. Craig Seroise (ph) . Please proceed, sir. Craig Seroise Good morning, to you guys. I've all ready had a long day, but good morning out there. One thing I'd like, if you can, qualify - quantify the 15 million drop in the operating income at Matson. Can you separate out what was ship operations? And what might have been due to the Sand Island pick up I guess it was? 7 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

APRIL 18, 2002 / 7:00PM, - Q1 2002 Alexander&Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO Yeah, I - this is Allen, I can give you some general direction - really all that specific, Craig (ph) . It's a good question. The terms of the variance for the quarter, market factors represented about $5 million of the variance strictly the market. That would be Hawaii and the Guam market. In very general terms there was about a $3 million reduction because of a share change versus the competition. And part of that had to do with the fact that our service levels are low. So it wasn't just a matter of pricing. It was just that because of some of the problems that we had we've lost some business here from what had been a historically share that the Matson had had. So that's about another three million. We've got about 2.5 million of inefficiencies at Sand Island. We have about $1 million of unusual bad debt, almost all of which is due to Kmart. We have about a $1 million, Jim mentioned the pension credit issues, about $1 million of the pension credit change year-over-year. About $600,000 reduction in our affiliate performance, which brings you up to about $13 million of the variances. You've got a couple of million dollars which is everything else. Inflationary increase is offset by improvements because we have fewer vessels and other benefits that have been achieved. Craig Seroise Thanks. That's good detail. That's more than I expected without your Matson guys there. Now ... Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO I don't know if that's a compliment or not. Craig Seroise It's a compliment. The Sand Island, what's needed there to improve the efficiency? It this is volume cargo thing or have other things been identified? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO It's really not volume driven. It's just after decades of using one approach is how the terminal has operated. They mad a conversion about two-thirds of the way last year. It turned out that it's been not only from a technical standpoint but management and labor standpoint much, much more significant transition than the company had originally anticipated. So the shake down period here is taking a while. We're seeing improvement, for example we had in the first quarter, just one of the ratios, and I mean it's not really very god right now. The first quarter we were getting off of our cranes about 17.2 moves an hour. We expected that we wanted to be getting about 21, that was our objective. But by the end of the quarter, we were operating at slightly above 18. So there was a trend upward, but as I in general terms indicated at the beginning, while we're seeing progress, we're still not hitting the objective that had been established. And it's not one or two things. It's a list of like 20 or 30 different issues that deal with different practices and how the shifts are unloaded and then reloaded when they leave. But we're making progress. It's the biggest change that this part of the company has had in decades. It also involved things like global positioning systems and things that just don't necessarily come all that easy to an operating business. So it's an absolutely, revolutionary change that we probably, certainly did underestimate the challenges of just launching as well as we wanted to. 8 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

APRIL 18, 2002 / 7:00PM, - Q1 2002 Alexander&Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Craig Seroise Thanks. Now you mentioned the bad debt due to Kmart. Did they - on the property side, did they lease any properties from you? I know Wal-Mart has a Hawaii property. Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO Yeah. The answer to that is that we sold approximately two years ago a Kmart property that we had owned. So on the leasing side, there is no exposure. On the operating side, we actually did pretty well relative to the size of business we have with Kmart in terms of our recovery of the receivables. It's just that we weren't able to recover all. Craig Seroise OK. And just the capital - the cap ex budget for this year. If you buy those ships that you were - referred to, would that be this year or would that be going into more next year? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO You can assume that there will be modest at best and perhaps zero but very, very little capital impact in the year 2002 from any vessel construction activity. Craig Seroise OK. Then what's the plan for '01 without that possibility? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO The plan for '01? Or the plan for '02? Craig Seroise I mean '02, excuse me. Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO Yeah. We have a plan that has about $120 million of capital spending in it. Craig Seroise OK. Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO That involves a massive and a fairly low level of 25 to $30 million. We got our real estate business in at about $80 million and our agribusiness in at about $10 million. Now of the $80 million we have in the real estate business, you can assume that about half of that or maybe even a little big 9 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

APRIL 18, 2002 / 7:00PM, - Q1 2002 Alexander&Baldwin Earnings Conference Call more is what we would call growth acquisition activity. So it's not replacement or project spending it's acquisition activity that we put in our budget for the year. Craig Seroise OK. That were - that would seem to indicate to me that there's going to be a lot more spending in the - as the year progresses than there was in the first quarter which was pretty low, but that's OK. Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO That's correct. Craig Seroise Yeah. And then for Jim, is that 38 percent tax rate good for the year? Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - Senior Vice Presidnt, CFO That is our latest projection based on everything we know about full year estimates, yes. Craig Seroise OK. One final one I have for you if it could. Let's see if I - I'm not an accountant I don't know if I understand this new rules here. Does this mean that every time there's a real estate sale that you might have to report discontinued operations for the quarter? This could get messy if that's the case. Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - Senior Vice Presidnt, CFO Well the technical answer is yet if it's material. And if, as we do with just about all of our income properties, we track them from revenues and cost standpoints separately. So yes, this is a very messy rule for a company like Alexander & Baldwin. Craig Seroise Right. Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - Senior Vice Presidnt, CFO I know the REITs are struggling with it too. And we're all going to be very interested and see how, you know, various companies interpret this who are in the real estate business. Craig Seroise OK. Me too. OK. Thanks a lot. 10 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

APRIL 18, 2002 / 7:00PM, - Q1 2002 Alexander&Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO I would just make one comment on that. Jim mentioned it earlier on, but the strange aspect of this is that we will sell a property for example for $25 million. We will then put the proceeds from that which we have done historically consistently into escrow, we will exchange it on a tax deferred basis into another property. So we consider the sale as a continued operation. But from a practical standpoint, we've had a history of reinvesting into other properties the proceeds from our sales. Craig Seroise Right. That hasn't... Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO So it's a very difficult accounting rule for us. Craig Seroise Yes, well that hasn't changed. My difficulty is trying to explain that to maybe some investors that don't understand but that's my problem. OK. So thanks a lot. Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - Senior Vice Presidnt, CFO It has the practical effect of making total operating profit far less meaningful than it used to be. Craig Seroise Yeah. Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - Senior Vice Presidnt, CFO But we have made an effort to provide you the information in a way that you can see it on the old basis and also see the adjustments. Craig Seroise Right. Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - Senior Vice Presidnt, CFO And as long as we're able to we'll continue to do that. Craig Seroise OK. Thank you very much and have a good day. 11 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

APRIL 18, 2002 / 7:00PM, - Q1 2002 Alexander&Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - Senior Vice Presidnt, CFO Thanks, Craig (ph) . Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO Thanks, Craig (ph) . Operator And our next question comes from Mr. Keith Hanson (ph) Please proceed, sir. Keith Hanson Aloha from Sunny, Columbus. Thank you for the additional disclosure. Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO That is Ohio. Keith Hanson It is Ohio, that's right. It's supposed to cool off by the weekend but I guess we're enjoying it this week. The question I had was is there going to be any impact on Matson from a potential work disruption in the west coast? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO Yeah, that's a good question, a very good question. I can give you the stock response we don't know and we hope not. From a practical standpoint, this is the every three year reopening of the contract with the IOWU first on the west coast and then in Hawaii. The big issue this year is the use of technology on the - at the terminals. And I don't think anyone really knows how difficult an issue that is going to be between the union and the various management organizations that are involved on the other side. We hope that there won't be any disruptions. Normally, what happens is that instead of a strike there have been some slow downs in the past. And those are difficult to deal with as well. So, you know, it's really hard to say what's going to happen. The hope is that everything will be settled in a reasonable manner as the contract expires at the end of June. Keith Hanson OK. Thank you. Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - Senior Vice Presidnt, CFO We do bargain as an industry, Keith. So it's the whole coast at once, one employer group, one labor group. 12 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from Mr. Tom Spiro (ph) . Please proceed sir. Tom Spiro - Spiro Capital Tom Spiro (ph) , Spiro Capital (ph) , hello? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO Hi, Tom (ph) . Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - Senior Vice Presidnt, CFO Hi, Tom (ph) . Tom Spiro - Spiro Capital Hello. Could you update us please on the potential entrant of one or more new competitors into the Matson line of business, yes, Pasha (ph) and the second potential competitor? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO Yeah, there's really - we didn't say anything about this. We've talked about this during the last two or three calls. And you're probably wondering why we haven't mentioned it in this call and that's basically because there is absolutely no new information. The ship that was partially - it was under construction partially built. It was involved in a bankruptcy action, a ship yard. And it's sitting at the same state of completion that it was about nine months ago. So we don't know whether that ship will ever be completed. There's speculation that it won't but we can't say. So that's where things are with Pasha which was the entrant into the Hawaii service that was most imminent. There's been an announcement made by a group, it calls itself Santa Maria. And we haven't heard anything about them in quite a while. So they had planned to secure financing relative to coming into the Hawaii market. The - what's happened with this Pasha vessel and also the fact that there's something called American classic crews which had $300 million plus of government loans that's going upside down on a cruise line that serves Hawaii. It might make it a little bit more difficult from a political standpoint for these things to be financed but we really don't know. So at this point, the reason it wasn't brought up today is that there's absolutely no information that would make for any changes. Tom Spiro - Spiro Capital Thanks a lot. 13 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

APRIL 18, 2002 / 7:00PM, - Q1 2002 Alexander&Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO You're welcome, Tom (ph) . Operator And once again, for those of you who have a question, that was one four on your touch-tone phone. Thank you. And our next question comes from Mr. Paul Patrick (ph) , please proceed sir. Paul Patrick Hi, good morning. Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO Hi, Paul (ph) . Paul Patrick A question on Matson, you talked about service difficulties and it sounds like it might be something separate from Sand Island. Is that the case? And can you talk about why it's going on? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO No, it's mostly Sand Island. I mean they're all - these are service disruptions. The service disruptions increase in the winter, but that's sort of you sail the same seas that everyone does. So your ship arrival on time percentage has a tendency to go down during the winter season, but that goes down for everybody. The principal problem is the Sand Island problem. Paul Patrick OK. And you also talked about pricing pressure from I guess it's the CSX is that - is there anything new? Is there any reason behind that? I know that they heard that they are getting - are looking to be sold. I don't know if that would have anything to do with it? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO Yeah, I didn't say anything about pricing pressure from CSX. Paul Patrick You said pricing pressure as a cause of the decline in the business at Matson. 14 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

APRIL 18, 2002 / 7:00PM, - Q1 2002 Alexander&Baldwin Earnings Conference Call Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO No, I really didn't. Paul Patrick Oh, you didn't? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO If I did I apologize for saying that. You know, in this business it's just about like every other semi commodity business, you've got a lot of punching and pulling going on an a day to day basis. They - CSX is pretty competitive now on pricing but that is not a principal factor for what is - what's happened on the performance side. Paul Patrick OK. Jim Andrasick - Alexander & Baldwin - Senior Vice Presidnt, CFO And both carriers have made general REIT decisions recently. And both carriers have in their own ways redefined their bunker surcharges. So I think we're - that's really not a practical problem. Paul Patrick Great. And then one question on the property leasing, the margins were down considerably year-over-year is there any explanation behind that? Allen Doane - Alexander & Baldwin - President and CEO Yeah, the margins are down a little bit. It's a little bit occupancy and we - it's a bit of a few one timers. Our plans for the year show that, you know, that we're going to be OK for the full year. That we're going to have a pretty good performance. We had about a 6 percent blip year-over-year decline in the first quarter. But there's really nothing that's all that remarkable or unusual happening in our portfolio. We're very diversified. But we're diversified on the mainland which - west coast, which has had it's own, you know, set of economic challenges until recently and then in Hawaii. So we're showing weaknesses in the portfolio but it's not that significant. And we're not - we're just not that concerned about. Paul Patrick Great. Thank you. Operator Once again, for those of you who have a question that was one four. 15 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

APRIL 25, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q3 2002 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call Operating income for the quarter was compared to operating and income of $2.4 million for the third quarter of last year, and a $1.8 million operating loss in the second quarter of fiscal 2002, excluding the results of Fithem (ph) and Ametron, which enter acquired effective October 1st, and October 30th versus 2001 respectively, and would have had sales of $17.3 million and an operating income of $1.8 million dollars, down 21 percent and 25 percent respectively from the third quarter last year, and up 16 percent, and 103 percent sequentially from the second quarter of fiscal 2002. Net income from the third quarter was $945,000, or four cents per diluted share, compared to $2.2 million or 12 cents per diluted share in the third quarter of last year, and a loss of two cents per diluted share for the second quarter of 2002. Prior to the extraordinary gain, the improvement in profitability over the second quarter was a result of increased ad sales and improved efficiency at a Syracuse operations. Manufacturing yields, and operating performance of during the third quarter were also better than anticipated. The growth in the third quarter, over the second quarter, was driven by group. Wireless group would acquire over $13.4 million, up 26 percent sequentially from the second quarter. Eliminating the impact of the acquisitions of Fithen (ph) and Ametron, Wireless Group net sales increased 30 percent sequentially from the second quarter. The growth of Wireless Group net sales was the result of increased marketing share of component products in several of our leading manufacturers. And resumption of demand for our Adrena-line (ph) for three G amplifier application. Wireless Group customer concentration for the quarter as a percent of Wireless Group net sales was at 18 percent, Ericsson at 17 percent, Lucent at 10 percent, and Motorola at 90 percent. We continue to impressively invest in new product development for wireless infrastructure, and wireless applications. New products last quarter have been well received in the market, and more than a dozen new ones have already been achieved. Sample requests for new design applications continue to be very robust. For the space and defense group, net sales for the third quarter were $6.5 million, up 14 percent from net sales of $5.6 million for the third quarter of last year. for the quarter with $5.9 million, driven by follow-on orders from jamming sub-systems and initial funding for Antennae Distribution Networks for a ground based radio program. March 31, 2002, was approximately $35.1 million. Third quarter made some substantial progress in establishing a presence in China to better serve the Asian market. We now have a facility in China, and the associated licensing to support our product's sales, design, manufacturing and distribution. We have also hired the management, sales and engineering team to support this effort. We anticipate initiating production at our China facility during the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Joe Porcello will now review the financial highlights. Joe Porcello - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - Vice President of Finance Good afternoon. The financial highlights of the third quarter income statement, the 50,000 through our column. The gross profit margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2002 was 32.1 percent. This is a 6.2 percent point increase from gross margin of 25.09 percent in the second quarter of this 2002, and a three point two percentage point decrease from the gross margins of 35.3 percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2001. The improvement of gross margins from the second to the third quarter of fiscal 2002 came from the overall increase in sales volume and from crafts and performance at 5M, whose manufacturing facility is now fully operational from the July fire. Including the private and the current acquisitions, growth margins were 39.2 percent for the third quarter of 2002 compared to margins of 36.2 percent of the second quarter and margins of 35.3 percent in the third quarter of last year. 3 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

APRIL 25, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q3 2002 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call Investment in research and development presented net sales with nine percent in the third quarter of 2002 compared to an ongoing three percent revenue in the second quarter of 2002 and 5.5 percent in the third quarter of the last year. Research and development expenditures have risen significantly due to an emphasis by the company on developing new standard products for the wireless infrastructure and local area network applications over the last nine months. This effort has culminated in a number of new purpose station product introductions over the last few months. We assume the same R&D spending will continue with higher rating over the next few quarters as we continue our new product development. Each comes from operations with 2.8 percent of revenue in the third quarter compared to a negative 10.3 percent of revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2002, and 11 percent of the revenue in the third quarter of 2001. Operating margins improved over the second quarter of fiscal 2002 just before providing the new sales level ended in the result of operating performance to . We currently do not expect missing an improvement in our operating income over third quarter 2002 while have volume and it will continue to increase in normal development level . Income before taxes was 6.4 percent for the current third quarter. This compares to a loss before the tax an extraordinary item will negative four point eight percent of revenue in the second quarter of 2002, and it comes before taxes of 19.3 percent of revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2001. Improvements from the loss in the second quarter was attributable to operating losses by the two point four million in quarter two for a loss of one point, operating loss of $1.1 million in quoted . Well, as the overall for the quarter with approximately 21 percent compared to 34.3 percent in the third quarter of 2001. The third, the current tax rate has declined as tax exempt income has grown as a percent of total income and due to the tax benefit resulting from the proposed buyer and . In connection with purchase by them in October 2001, we recorded a two point four million dollar extraordinary gain in the second quarter. Directed by the negative goodwill resulting from the transaction, during the third quarter, five of them had loss equal to tax benefits with approximately $1 million compared to a loss equal tax benefit of two point four million for the second quarter. The smaller loss defined them in the quarter three compared to quarter two was the result of the resumption in both out sourcing and clean up costs related to the fire and in the movement in manufacturing news. That income as a percent of revenue was five percent in the third quarter compared to 12.7 percent for the third quarter of 2001 and 17.7 percent for the second quarter of fiscal 2002, which concluded with the extraordinary gain amounting to 19.8 percent of revenue. On a per share basis, there wasn't a very (ph) per share for the third quarter of 2002 exploit them. This is compared to 12 times the diluted share in the third quarter of the previous year and 13 cents including the extraordinary gain of 15 cents per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2002. The balance sheet highlights include tag cash and quick work for investments for approximately $125 million in modern 2002, down $3.6 million from June 2001, namely to the all $12 million of the tab being used purchased by them and first half of fiscal 2002. We have continued to enjoy a positive cash flow of proper rations in the first nine months of net income.

Inventories March 31st, 2002, were 20 million compared to 18.6 million in the June 30th, 2001. The inventory increase was due to the addition of 5M into Ametron who had approximately two million dollars in inventory in March 31st, 2002. Inventory levels without the acquisition declined approximately three percent during the first nine months. Capital equipment, employees and services in the first nine months of fiscal 2002 amounted to approximately seven million dollars, up to five million dollars represents new equipment purchased by between October and March 2002 in replace of the that were destroyed in the July fire. Remaining additions were mainly production facility, automated production equipment for our power on Long Island and new and multi-layer manufacturing equipment at in Massachusetts. Accounts payable is March 31, 2002 to 5.1 million dollars. Up 2.8 million from June 30, 2001. The acquisition of side ends and Ametron amounted in $1.4 million March 31st. And a remaining $700,000 rise resulted from the current . Lawrence Sala - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - President and CEO Thanks Joe. At the previous quarters visibility from our given a current level of market visibility through projecting net sales to the inner range of $19 million to $21 million dollars and diluted earnings per share can be in the range of three to five cents for the fourth quarter. We're now taking questions. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Operator Thank you, sir. The question and answer session will be conducted electronically. If you would like to ask a question please press the star key followed by the digit one on your touch-tone telephone. We will in the order you signal us and questions as time permits. Again please press star one if you would like to ask a question. And we'll hear first from Mark Mischeka (ph) , Bank of America Securities. Mark Mischeka - Bank of America Securities Hi, yes. Larry good day, good quarter. The question was, is that really just stepped out. I haven't seen them on them on your customer lists in awhile 17 percent. This is all . Can you describe a little bit about what that is and I think pretty significant to the quarter though. Lawrence Sala - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - President and CEO Yeah, they went and tumbled for us in dollar sales as well for the quarter over our previous business levels with them. Mark (ph) , we had announced last quarter that we had gained market share in our businesses in this years volume purchase agreement negotiations back in December. So we had announced that and that's played out for us and we're seeing that. are falling off into heavy at higher rates than we were in previous quarters. 5 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

APRIL 25, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q3 2002 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call And we also saw this pick up of with them. It was business we probably haven't seen demand for in more than a year and it came back fairly robustly this quarter. So both those factors much larger customer purpose for it than they've been for the last year or so. Mark Mischeka - Bank of America Securities I understand. And then on your visibility you're saying it's, you know, it's still kind of limited them (ph) . Remember last quarter you said that it really increased from a couple weeks to maybe six weeks or so. Are you seeing the change? Are you still up at the six to eight weeks now or has it ticked down. Where are you at with the visibility going into June here? Lawrence Sala - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - President and CEO We can still see the people ordering out in time but it's the ordering that's still sporadic. The demand is not, you know, that's sequentially increasing every month. We go back, you know, we saw strong December, strong January, got a little linger in February and it kind of leveled out there in March, and April so far has been I'd say on the mediocre side. More consistent with February and March than it was with the strife we saw in December and January. So definitely still think people ordering out in time, making , you know, up relative to what we saw in October, November. But not consistently sequential . Mark Mischeka - Bank of America Securities Got you. And then one last question is, I know you didn't give guidance at court here but are you getting any kind of indications for the second half of the year? Are you expecting normal seasonality, seasonal spending patterns from the carriers, or is it too early to say? Lawrence Sala - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - President and CEO It's probably too early to say, Mark (ph) . I think the only guidance we can give you now is that anything out in time is relatively consistent with rates of use and order patterns. It's not dramatically up and it's not dramatically down. So , you know, when we were looking in negotiating and discussing with people back in December they saw appreciable pick up in the second half of the year. I think we found the first half to be stronger than our expectations in the second half to be a little lighter than their expectations. So we're seeing things be pretty consistent out in time with what people are consuming right now. Mark Mischeka - Bank of America Securities Got you. OK. Thanks, Joe and Larry. Lawrence Sala - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - President and CEO Sure. 6 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

APRIL 25, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q3 2002 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call Operator Our next question comes from Rich Alera (ph) of Edenman (ph) . Rich Alera - Edenman Thank you, nice job on the quarter, Larry, and obviously a tough environment here. In terms of the sequential this quarter it seems like you saw a fairly small pick up in the combined contribution from 5M to Ametron and I thought we'd hope in the June quarter, possibly both of them could kick in more significantly. Do you still expect this? And if so is the sort of sequentially guidance really, 'cause we're expecting maybe other parts of the wireless business to maybe not pick up as much. Lawrence Sala - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - President and CEO Yeah, that, we fully expect to see some pick up from -- both Ametron and 5M's production rates have consistently come up in the last, at the end of the last quarter and we expect that to continue. Not an obviously dramatic contribution but certainly a higher contribution than it's been. And we're just being cautious in this potentially small for what we've seen over the last couple of months. So, you know, obviously we'll need some contribution. We're at the high end of our range. We're expecting to see some sequential growth but if things back off as they've been during the summer, we just aren't seeing out that far yet. Rich Alera - Edenman Sure. Power Wave is a pretty basic customer. Could you characterize how much of that is unit driven and how much of that is new content driven? I think I understand that you've got some nice content on some of their newer platforms. Lawrence Sala - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - President and CEO Yeah, that quarter I'd say, is still predominantly unit driven. Just pick up and demand, you know, working off of inventory and using, you know, higher rates of compliment usage. This month we're starting to see more higher dollar product use more consistently from them. So I think a higher dollar content will show more this quarter than it did last. The Power Wave, you know, historically has been a larger customer of ours and they've been or so, you know, 12 to 15 percent more for quite awhile. Rich Alera - Edenman On the Ericsson business, and I know this is a tough one but do you have any feel, they obviously had a spurt in the beginning of last year where they ordered a bunch of three G adrenaline and that kind of went away for several quarters and it sounds like you've had another spurt here. Any feel for if it's going in inventory or if are being shipped out into the field? 7 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

APRIL 25, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q3 2002 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call Lawrence Sala - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - President and CEO No, we can never see that for absolute certain. All we can say is that the demand for goes out a long, long time. There's no, no appreciable holds, no demand right now that we've seen. pretty consistent week to week and month to month for more than a year. And they manufacture at multiple facilities now around the world. So all that we can see, the demand should sustain itself but we don't know where the equipment's going. We don't know if it's going out the door or not. We don't get that kind of visibility. Rich Alera - Edenman But right now their forecasts have been pretty inconsistent looking out. Lawrence Sala - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - President and CEO Yeah. Rich Alera - Edenman You mentioned the land products in your comments. Can you give us some more on kind of what you're doing in that area and when we might see some revenue impact on that? Lawrence Sala - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - President and CEO which we introduced last quarter as part of the multiple product introduction that we had. What we're starting to introduce and past more and more miniaturized products from what we've sold. So they're, you know, our traditional we're one dollar, one dollar and 50 cent ASPs sold into relatively high power applications. Some of these newer products are a quarter of the size or an eighth of the size of those high power products. And we're looking at ASP's of 50 cents down to maybe even 20 to 25 cents over the next couple of quarters. For products going into, you know, 2.4 gigahertz (ph) and five gigahertz (ph) wireless networking application. So that's near at the targeting and, and some of our product development and focus is miniaturizing some for the zinger types of products that we've been susceptible with and high power applications and targeting more feed and networking applications going forward. So we're pretty optimistic about our ability to begin miniaturization. but we're still looking at a quarter or two before we'll be introducing a product publicly with those implications. Rich Alera - Edenman Thank you. Lawrence Sala - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - President and CEO Yep. 8 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

APRIL 25, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q3 2002 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call Operator Our next question comes from Dale Faha (ph) of CIBC World Markets. Dale Faha - CIBC World Markets Afternoon, guys. Joe Porcello - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - Vice President of Finance How are you doing, Dale? Dale Faha - CIBC World Markets Good. A question here on your margins. In your commentary you mentioned that with the 5M and a brother acquisition that you would have had a 39 percent gross margin. Is that correct ? Joe Porcello - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - Vice President of Finance Yeah, that's correct. Dale Faha - CIBC World Markets So when we look into the doom quarter as , can we see that a total gross margin begin to pick up? And then maybe you can give me some idea of what kind of run rate you need at those guys to get us back up to some of your historical corporate gross margins. Joe Porcello - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - Vice President of Finance Well, going forward we're seeing somewhat of a change in the next very large in the third quarter. We don't see the same thing happening in quarter four. We actually see the margins I think will be some here. Dale Faha - CIBC World Markets At what level of revenue at Ametron and 5M do you think you can get their gross margins up to the corporate average, Joe? Joe Porcello - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - Vice President of Finance We need significantly lower coming up from the fire, and the revenues now are probably at a third of what they were at their peak. So we would see a significant increase probably in 5M facility. And probably pretty close to that is the Ametron facilities from the kind of margins we expect to see. Dale Faha - CIBC World Markets Do you have any hope of achieving those kinds of revenues rates during this calendar year? 9 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

APRIL 25, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q3 2002 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call Joe Porcello - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - Vice President of Finance Maybe towards the latter part of the year. It's really too early to tell at this point. Lawrence Sala - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - President and CEO You know just to give you a , in this last quarter revenues were pretty much sequentially flattened by them over the prior quarter. It's just in the prior quarter we were manufacturing an outside facility as well as their own. In this last quarter all of our production was shipped out of our facility. We're expecting an increase in revenue there this quarter from last, you know, off of the base that they had. But there's still a long way from getting back the revenue rate where they were. So we've got a ways to go. Actually next week we have a sales meeting at the 5M facility where we're going to engage our global sales force to start pursuing new business at 5M. And we think we have, you know, many opportunities to gain share. We're selling to the paying customers our to our application as we develop our other products. So it assimilates well into the sales force. But today we've just been getting back up to production with existing customers and the existing business that they had that had been put off after the fires. So we hadn't engaged our sales force yet because, you know, we would not be able to respond to it until the factory was fully running and we're back caught up on our customers . So we're pretty optimistic that sales could grow at 5M fairly rapidly once we engage our sales forces here. So I think by the end of next quarter we'll have a pretty clear picture as to how sales are going well because our sales force will have a couple months of activity in the marketing place to see how we can share. But it's a little early to say that it's the end of the year or it's, you know, a quarter or two quarters, three quarters away yet. But by the time we're in call on this quarter we should be prepared to answer that question more accurately. Dale Faha - CIBC World Markets And tax for next quarter and looking into the next fiscal year? Joe Porcello - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - Vice President of Finance Tax rate for the next portion would be similar to this quarter. we may see a one time come through here or if there's some territorial sales credits. I would say normally to 20 percent. Dale Faha - CIBC World Markets What about next year? 10 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

APRIL 25, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q3 2002 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call Joe Porcello - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - Vice President of Finance Next year's gonna depend on the income level and how the business comes back. If business comes back we'll be expecting up into the low thirties somewhere and the normal rate. Dale Faha - CIBC World Markets And one final question. Could you give me some indication of your core wireless business. What percentage of the business with components and was any of your business higher level assembly or point? Joe Porcello - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - Vice President of Finance Yeah, I mean we're always generating some business and historically it's been about 50/50, Dale (ph) . This past quarter was somewhere between component business and more custom types of products. It's probably more 55 percent components and 45 percent other stuff. And I'd say that mix is probably going to stay in that range. Dale Faha - CIBC World Markets Great. Thank you much. Joe Porcello - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - Vice President of Finance Thank you. Operator Once again, please press star one at this time if you would like to ask a question. We'll move now to Tom Laview (ph) with Robertson Stephens. Tom Laview - Robertson Stevens Thank you, guys. Good quarter there. You talked a little bit about the China announcement and what a little bit more meat on the bone in terms of when you believe production and general business proceeded . Unidentified Sure. We actually initiated that late last calendar year, about the fourth calendar quarter of last year, signed our business license and leased our facility in February, March time frame. And we have actually hired our agent's sale manager, our agent's operations manager and we're relocating from our Syracuse facility over to our China operations. So are hear training now at the Syracuse facility on production activities and sales activities that we'll be initiating over the next couple months. So they should be out of sight within the next couple months. The facility is being outfitted and equipped now. 11 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

APRIL 25, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q3 2002 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call And we're probably looking at something between $250,000 and $500,000 investment to get up and running. Mainly replicating some of the equipment processes we have here at . Nothing too new or too risk (ph) from what we do now. And so they should be on site during the middle of this current quarter to the end of this current quarter. So sometime between late May and June they'll be on site and up and going and we expect to have production initiated some time in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. So before the end of September we'd like to be up and running. we have a couple product lines we'd like to get going with over there. Some new product lines that we'd like to get started with an relocating some product lines and we're seeing some growth. We'd like to address that growth out of that facility because we believe we can be more competitive. Tom Laview - Robertson Stevens One question on the space and defense business. The operating is there. The last couple quarters have been north of 20 percent. Should we assume that that's continuing and working until the end of this year? Unidentified Those margins that are really dependent upon the at the kind of business level we would expect that we could probably maintain time margins, yes. Tom Laview - Robertson Stevens OK. And then by that estimation that would be the wireless business has made a dramatic gain in the operating margin. Could we expect even with sort of flattish revenue growth, getting back to almost a break even in operating margins? Sort of getting back to zero there. Unidentified Yeah. We're really . Yes. Tom Laview - Robertson Stevens OK. And , can you give me the operating income that you stated in the call excluding the Ametron and 5M? Unidentified It's . Tom Laview - Robertson Stevens Well I've got one question here while you're looking for that. With the break out ... 12 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

APRIL 25, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q3 2002 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call Unidentified Operating, I'm sorry, operating income without 5M and Ametron was $1.8 million. Tom Laview - Robertson Stevens In the break period of 2000 two products you obviously spent a lot of time this quarter introducing products. Can you talk a little bit about the vector modulator, the applications there? And then also some application where imbedding active devices. Unidentified Yeah, we've been doing this for quite some time, actually, building products that corporate . This is the first time though in a couple of years that we really aggressively started doing this again in partnership with some . The vector modulator was used at the front end of a power amplifier and actually can do the single manipulation required for linearization. So when somebody instructs it to or amplitude of the signal or improving the amplifier performance . As far as the technology, we can imbed just about any kind of active or passive component into our multi-layer strip line technology. And as I said we promoted it's sole product more than five or six years ago for wireless applications at that point. components. So the technology is not brand new but we're doing a lot of different and new things with it these days. You know, an example is our . Going forward we're looking to do a lot of different things from different types of amplifiers with applications as well as module applications with a technology from both transmit high power applications low power applications. So it's really a platform for us to do many different functions with the modulators. Just the first of those products. Tom Laview - Robertson Stevens OK, that's all. Thank you very much. Unidentified Thanks. Operator from Mark Mischeka (ph) at Bank of America Securities. Mark Mischeka - Bank of America Securities All right. a little housekeeping. Joe, did you have the customer mix for last, I guess not, yeah for last quarter?

Joe Porcello - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - Vice President of Finance Yes I did get and I have the Motorola Power Wave. But we were with Ericsson last quarter. Lawrence Sala - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - President and CEO The quarter before . Mark Mischeka - Bank of America Securities December, yeah. Lawrence Sala - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - President and CEO Yeah. Mark Mischeka - Bank of America Securities OK. Lawrence Sala - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - President and CEO Last quarter Ericsson was about 20 percent of our wireless net sales. Unidentified That's good because we had at 16. at 12 and Power Wave at 15. Mark Mischeka - Bank of America Securities similar patters in March or do you expect Ericsson to become next quarter? Joe Porcello - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - Vice President of Finance No I think we're right now seeing things stand relatively where they are. Mark Mischeka - Bank of America Securities OK. Got you. And then a question on the 5M acquisition. It seemed like, you know, your gross margin took a hit because of that. Can you explain, is there some amortization or accounting that's going on there that goes away at some point? How should we look at that? 14 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

APRIL 25, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q3 2002 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call Lawrence Sala - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - President and CEO Well, what basically happened was that all this business interruption insurance that we've received for the fire was what has basically covered the expenses of the company for probably after we bought them were recognized in the purchase accounting. we have plenty of cash and if you look at their balance now they're still sitting on about $3.6 million dollars in cash and we're nine months out from the fire. So they're covering their expenses with the resources they received from the insurance company. But it was all recognized in terms of the revenue gaining back when we purchased the company. So now we're basically having expenses with significant revenues to off set the expenses. That's where you're getting your operating loss. And going forward until revenues rise to the prior levels, we're still going to suffer some kind of operating loss. We had 2.4 million dollar operating loss which has dropped to about one million dollars in quarter three and we expected the smaller improvements in quarter four because most of the are between two and three to put the factory back together. When you look at, if you lay the two against each other, Mark (ph) , when we recognize the gain of somewhere in $4 million to pay at the end of last quarter, we had estimated that that gain would cover their operating losses through probably September with a fairly conservative assumption of how revenue is gonna come back again. This quarter was actually a little bit better than we expected in terms of performance. So we have, you know, things are coming back a little bit better than we expected them to so far. The real telltale will be how in selling our technology and getting the revenue level up from here. So far it's operating better than we expected but if we had to recognize it as a one time gain and now we're taking in the operating losses . Mark Mischeka - Bank of America Securities Got you. OK. And then just on what gets revenue going back there again. Is this picking up some of the them actually giving design that Nokia . Joe Porcello - Anaren Microwave Incorporated - Vice President of Finance That's exactly it. That's where we're focusing first is on our big amplifier customers. They actually had relationship with Nokia prior to our involvement. We believe they have some fairly unique technology in building very cost effective high power amplifier microwave circuit boards. So we think their technology applies to all of our customers and that they have some pretty unique capabilities to do things competitors and that's getting anybody introduced to the market place. So I saw shorter selling cycles than a lot of the other products that we offer because they can come in, take the drawing and get into production within a matter of a month. They don't have to wait for designing cycles to get in and get going. So there is better opportunity to get the revenue rate up quickly than say products that we introduce that have to go through a new design cycle. Mark Mischeka - Bank of America Securities OK, great. Thanks for the explanation there. 15 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Operator Mike Lawcid (ph) of RBC Capital with our next question. Cliff Maldonado - RBC Capital Yes, hi, this is Cliff Maldonado (ph) for Mike Lawcid (ph) . I was wondering if you could review the competitive landscape for the . Unidentified We really don't see a big difference in landscape around the world. We pretty much deal with the same global competitors everywhere. We've been competitively I think like anything we're seeing, you know, see competition. A lot of people try to get into different product areas and try to do anything they can do to get their revenue rate up. But not a lot changing quarter to quarter in the competitive landscape. We're still seeing this . Cliff Maldonado - RBC Capital How about pricing pressure? Unidentified Well, you know, continues to be strong. Customers are all looking to enhance their margins. I'd say that changes in the marketplace has probably been more frequent. Price and negotiations with our customers, some customers wanting to negotiate every six months or even every quarter versus annually. But, you know, certainly more pressure than we saw even a year ago. Cliff Maldonado - RBC Capital What do you expect for for the next quarter? You know you mentioned you had some pressure on the margin. Do you expect to be ? Unidentified Somewhere around 20.12 percent of the sales. Somewhere in that . Cliff Maldonado - RBC Capital OK, thanks. 16 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

We'll hear now from Judson Copland (ph) of Morgan Family. Unidentified Hi. for Judson (ph) . How are you guys doing? Unidentified Good. Unidentified A couple quick questions. We didn't talk about Nokia too much on your core wireless business. But you did have a lot with those folks. Have you got any business attached to that? Unidentified Nothing substantially different. We do have a volume purchase agreement, we gained some share but it's off of obviously a very small paced, small customer of ours in the past. So they've pretty much called off the products to their forecast today. And not yet a large customer of ours. We would expect them next couple of quarters. Unidentified From the core business or for 5M or both? Unidentified From a core business. 5M is qualified hopefully by Nokia in this current quarter. They're actually visiting our 5M facility over the next couple of weeks I believe and hopefully we'll successfully complete the qualification with them. But it won't be after that that we start to see any kind of pick up at 5M. Unidentified OK. Could you quickly talk about your revenues from new products? Unidentified Our new products, well I guess that's how you define new products. As far as any of the new things that we've introduced in the last quarter or these breaking products, we don't expect to see revenue from them for at least another probably two quarters. Maybe some in our late third or fourth quarter of this calendar year. But the status . For us it's typically a nine month cycle to get new products in. 17 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

APRIL 25, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q3 2002 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call We're seeing a little bit of revenue earlier than we've ever seen it before. But whether it'll start to be a impact within the next quarter or two is yet to be seen. So maybe six months from the introduction we might see some production but nine months is more of the typical. The only other new thing this quarter was with the 3G adrenaline our first production of that product and probably at least a year. Unidentified What ? Unidentified We're seeing, you know, we've actually shipped reels of thousands of products out already even though we've just introduced that product a month and a half ago. So to our surprise, yes, some of the lower line products and some of the zinger circulator products, we're actually seeing a little bit of . But still we expect it to be another quarter or two before we see any steady significant production there. But that's pretty . In the past we -- typically it's been a longer time before we see products procured in those kind of volumes. Unidentified Why do you think that is for those two particular products? delay line. Unidentified I think it's because they're brand new concept products that offer savings, you know, appreciable savings over alternatives. So the delay line is very unique. There was never to our knowledge a product like that in the marketplace and it's substantially lower cost than alternatives that were out there. And similar with the zinger circulator, it's something brand new and fairly weak in the market. And so I think people are looking at it as a figure . Unidentified OK, and last question. Andrew Corporation announced the purchase of a company called Quasar (ph) yesterday. products. Can you give a sense for what you think that purchase or that category of product is placed within the . Unidentified To my knowledge is a lot more competitive with some of our older traditional products, case products than with anything that we really sell into the wireless marketplace today. I'm not super familiar with that product line. We never that I ever remember in our history running to them as a competitor or even considered an alternative to the things that we focus on. . 18 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

APRIL 25, 2002 / 9:00PM, ANEN.O^B14 - Q3 2002 Anaren Microwave Earnings Conference Call Unidentified And how or your new with our amplifiers or other components within the base station. What's kind of happening from the perspective and ? Unidentified Well we're, you know, we're definitely seeing the desire from to buy higher levels of assemblies. But for us it's really a potentially into a different customer. It's not really worth creating more opportunity for us or less so where as, you know, today we might sell to an amplifier manufacturer and we might sell to a manufacturer and we might sell to another sub-assembly manufacturer. As we go forward it's looking like that might be one big customer instead of three separate customers. But at the end of the day where we play in this food chain, we're still typically selling our components be it at L&A or combiner or at power amplifier. Unidentified You mentioned that they only wanted to buy higher level assemblies and one of your comments back at the was that you started to get some more of the signaling of base band signaling protocols from the . Is this the way that they're indicating that they want higher level assemblies by communicating some more of those protocols? Unidentified Not quite sure I fully understand your question. We're just saying that some of our customers sub systems rather than just so we're finding that, you know, our customers who might have just been doing a before or combiner or power amplifier before are now dabbling in all of those technologies and product areas and going after assemblies as opposed to just one piece. Unidentified Is there some kind of parallel behavior here appearing at the OEM's that you from your volume purchase agreement that is with that behavior from your customers? Unidentified No, I mean, from what we've seen in our limited view of the world, you know, our customers, you know, before they out sourced our and they out sourced filters and they out sourced L&A's. They still are, just might be trying to go to the one customer, one supplier instead of three different ones. And our customers traditionally build their own PA's or build their own filters, build their own L&A. They're still doing that. We haven't what they're doing. It's just how they're doing it and trying to find maybe one source instead of three different sources. Unidentified OK. That makes sense. Thank you very much. 19 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

APRIL 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q1 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call Our DSO and our contract business hit record lows in the first quarter. Worldwide e-commerce sales reached 488 million, on track to achieve $2 billion in 2002. We had strong operating results across all of our business segments. We added two new executives to our key management leadership team, a new CIO Patty Morrison, and a new CMO, Jocelyn Carter-Miller. We remain comfortable with our 2002 EPS growth target of 30 plus percent. On a consolidated sales basis, total first quarter revenue increased one percent, comparable worldwide sales declined one percent in the quarter. Our company-wide customer complaints dropped by 35 percent in the first quarter, our customer service indexes across all of our business segments increased. We did experience some softness in our European catalog operations, which I'll comment on when I get to international, and we continue to face strong U.S. dollar currency translation, which has the impact of impacting negatively our reported international sales and operating profits. On the comparable sales basis, retail comp sales were negative 1.7 percent for the first quarter, representing the fifth consecutive quarter of improving North America retail comp sales trends. The decline was still driven by a decline in hardware sales, with desktop and laptop computers comps dropping 18 percent, and overall technology sales were down 13 percent. Comp sales decreased 2.26 percent in our business services group during the first quarter of 2001, an improvement of negative 4 percent, in a similar period in the fourth quarter last year. Comp sales were somewhat soft across all customer size segments in BSG, excluding our e-commerce sales. These soft sales largely reflect the economic slowdown in medium and large contract accounts in the West in particular, and portions of the Central region. We continue to experience solid growth in the North and Southeast regions of the U.S. in our BSG business. International comparative sales were, grew four percent in local currencies in the first quarter. The strongest performance were in the Netherlands, Germany, Austria and Italy, with particular softness in the U.K., France and Japan. As we mentioned in our release this morning, we now anticipate some slowing of our historical high comp growth rates in our European catalog operations for the next few quarters, as a result of softer European economies, but somewhat offset by strong sales growth in France retail, and in the four countries where we have launched our new Office Depot Business Services Group. Our consolidated operating profit basis, as I said earlier, operating profit rose 69 percent to 164 million, from 97 million in 2001. Our North America retail operating profit achieved 7.6 percent, versus 4.3 percent in quarter one last year, and 6.2 percent -- 6.02 percent in quarter four. Our BSG group had its best ever quarter with Office Depot, with operating profit achieved at 9.9 percent of sales, in spite of negative comps. International division operating profit was almost 14 percent, versus 14.83 percent a year ago, despite softer catalog sales performance. Gross margin improvement more than offset our comparable sales softness. The biggest impact was in our North American retail business, where last year in the first quarter we had SKU rationalization. I'll comment more on that in the retail section. Lower levels of technology sales in North America retail also translate to a higher margin mix. We have for some time now, had more rational promotional activity, and we continue our intense focus on large contract account profitability. The key drivers of the operating profit expansion the first quarter, in addition to the gross margin increases, were that our BSG selling and operating costs improved by 224 basis points in the first quarter. As I said earlier, our customer service metrics substantially improved across all of our business segments. We did experience somewhat higher G&A costs, associated with international expansion to new countries, higher security and insurance costs as a result of the aftermath of September 11th, the inclusion of our new business forsure.com, their G&A costs in this quarter were not in the same quarter year ago, and some higher professional fees related to supply chain and merchandising initiatives that we're undertaking to even get better at supply chain, and higher bonus accruals to reflect our continued improvement in our performance metrics across all of our businesses. On a diluted gap reporting basis, EPS is 32 cents versus a first quarter year ago of 19 cents. Now let's talk about each of the business segments. North America retail sales -- as I said earlier, our fifth consecutive quarter of comparable sales improvement. Supplies continued to show improvement with positive comps overall on our supply business. Our first quarter product mix had furniture down four percent in the first quarter, versus 11 percent in the fourth quarter, some sign of improvement in that business. 3 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

APRIL 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q1 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call Overall technology hardware sales was down 13 percent in the quarter versus 25 percent in quarter four. It would appear to us that we may have bottomed out our decline in technology. Our software sales continue to be flattish. Average ticket in our North American retail business grew slightly in the quarter, an encouraging sign, and our average transactions were basically flattish. Our customer service index was up in our retail stores across our chain, as the benefits of our focus on making this a compelling place to shop continue to make shopping at Office Depot a better experience, evidenced by store complaints down again this quarter. This is the fifth or sixth consecutive quarter of improvement as we intentionally focus on making shopping at Office Depot a better place, and our average outs per store in spite of our inventory turn increases, and our supply chain efficiencies, actually went down in the first quarter this year, versus the first quarter of last year. Our North American operating profit in retail stores was up 289 basis points over the first quarter last year. Gross margins improved 312 basis points. Almost two-thirds of this gross margin improvement is directly attributable to the 2001 SKU rationalization we did in the first quarter of last year. The other third is changes in our promotional activity, becoming smarter about pricing and demand, and the continuing reflection of our improving margins in this business over the past four quarters. The balance of improvement is related to the continued mix shift, with softer technology sales, which have dropped from about 25 percent of our retail sales in 2000 to about 15 percent so far in 2002. As I said, I think that category has reached its bottom, and we now think there are opportunities, particularly in the second half of this year, to grow our share in technology on a profitable basis and recognize technology carries with it a very important market basket to Office Depot. Our store operating costs rose slightly in the quarter by 23 basis points. We continue tight control over our expenses, managing our payroll in a very difficult sales environment despite significant wage and healthcare benefit increases. We have flexed our payroll hours in response to softer sales, but we believe we are investing more payroll hours in our store model than our competitors, we believe that's why we're getting higher customer service levels, and we believe that leads to a better shopping experience. We have completed the roll out of our new store label model in almost 100 of our stores, we'll complete that roll out in the next quarter or two. We do expect to get savings as we've talked about. We're reinvesting part of those savings back in to better customer service to go along with the re-launch of our brand, which basically says what you need, and what you need to know, and we're investing our people so they get what they need to know to help customers. At the end of the first quarter we had 857 North America retail stores. We relocated two stores during the quarter, and closed two previously announced under-performing retail stores. Turning to our business service group sales, total sales in this sector increased one percent. As I said earlier, our contract division had strong growth in the Northeastern Southeast regions, but continued softness in the Western part of the United States and some parts of the Central region, in particular, Northern California continues to be heavily impacted by the decline in the technology industries of Northern California. We had, and continue to have, a very large presence in that sector, and that's been particularly soft for the last two or three quarters. Our revenue per order is down a bit from last year's levels, but rose slightly over the course of the first three months of this year. Again, another small sign of encouragement in terms of our delivery business, as our average order value went up slightly during the first quarter. Domestic e-commerce sales rose 35 percent. Our customer service indexes out of our North American delivery centers were their best ever, and rose to the highest levels in the history of Office Depot. Our warehouse customer complaints are down. Our call center complaints are down. Simply put, we're servicing customers better than we have ever in the past, and we're doing it with lower costs and that's a result of higher quality. Our operating profit in this segment was 9.9 percent for the first quarter, compared to 5.8 percent of last year. It is simply the best operating performance in our history in this segment. It improved by 402 basis points year over year. We had 178 basis point gross margin improvement in this business, as a result of our continued focus on contract pricing and account profitability. We do expect to see a slight reduction in gross margin percentage as we move through the balance of this year, as our growing national account sales begin to filter in to our sales mix. 4 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

APRIL 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q1 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call Our selling and operating costs were down 224 basis points versus last year. That's the result of the call center consolidation we completed last year, in which we said it would give us higher quality, better customer service and lower costs, and it has. And we also invested heavily last year in warehouse technology to improve quality and efficiency, and those improvements continue to flow through our operating expenses in spite of negative sales. March was the 15th consecutive month of record expense percentage in our North American warehouses. Our expenses per order continue to move down and we still believe that we can reduce our total warehouse operating costs year over year, by 100 basis points. The results could obviously be offset by a lack of sales leverage, but we're pretty proud of our performance in this segment, given the fact that we've been up against negative sales the last two quarters. As I said, our DSO in this segment was its best ever. It improved by six days. We tied this measurement to sales compensation, our sales force has responded positively. It's one of the reasons why our cash, our balance sheet, and our operating cash flow continue to remain strong. Internationally, total international sales in U.S. dollars were flat, and comp sales were down one percent. In local currencies, international sales rose five percent total, and comps four -- five percent a total increase, and comps rose four. Currency is still plaguing us. The strong U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales in this quarter by almost $20 million, and over $2 million of operating profit. We did see, in the quarters, some softness across most all of our European Viking catalog operations, and as I said earlier, with the largest impacts in the U.K. and France. Japan continues to under-perform as a result of their economy which remains in our viewpoint, in disarray. While we are seeing softness in our international catalog businesses, our BSD contract sales are still meeting or exceeding our initial plans in each of the four new countries in which we have an Office Depot BSD presence. Our retail business in France continues to encourage us. Comps in our French retail business in local currencies were up seven percent. We will open eight new stores this year, down slightly from our earlier target only because we're making certain we find great retail locations. We did have negative retail comps in Japan, down nine percent in the quarter in local currency. We did open two new Japanese stores in the first quarter, bringing us now to a total of 11 stores in Japan. In spite of that softness, our first quarter operating profit internationally was 14 percent, albeit down 80 basis points from last year. Gross margins in this business are trending strong, up 51 basis points despite the addition of a growing retail business in France, our introduction of our BSD contract business in four countries, and our new prospecting efforts in our two newest countries, Switzerland and earlier this quarter, in Spain. We believe we'll continue to buy better throughout Europe as we leverage our supply chain, and we're making better use of our global purchasing, our global brand, and our emphasis on private label throughout international and domestic businesses. Our store and warehouse operating costs increased in this business 131 basis points in the first quarter, reflecting the addition of the start-up costs in Switzerland, which we opened in early January, costs associated with the launch of Spain, which we opened during the first week of April, and three new countries which we have an Office Depot BSD presence that weren't in our numbers in the first quarter year ago. While softness in Japan did result in negative retail comps, we did improve our operating performance in Japan, and our losses this quarter were about $800,000 less than in the same quarter a year earlier, as we get our arms around our operating model in Japan. We still generate losses, we're still optimistic about Japan in the long term, we opened two stores and we're making progress, albeit we're still losing money in Japan. As I said earlier, we began operations in Switzerland early January, with encouraging results. We launched Spain with a direct-mail Viking business the first week of April, and we are very encouraged by our first week of results. First week's not a quarter, not a year, but we've got some encouraging signs about Spain. And we continue to invest, and will continue to invest, in this high performing, high return on asset, high return on sales business, as it still remains a key growth vehicle for our company in the future. In summary, we simply had strong performance across all of our business segments. We believe this proves the sustainability of all the actions we've taken to improve our business model that began over 18 months ago. All of this consistently improving performance has been achieved 5 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

APRIL 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q1 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call during a very challenging and difficult economic environment. Our balance sheet has never been better, our operating cash flows are strong, and we now have more access to more capital to grow our business than we've had in the past. During the quarter we successfully completed a $600 million credit facility over three years, which gives us the ability to have cash and credit to grow and invest in our business. We've enhanced our executive management team through the addition of two new outstanding executives, a CIO and a CMO, and we also added two new impressive board members to our already great board of directors. The consistency of our earnings performance has proven that when revenue overall begins to grow, we are able and capable, and have the physical discipline and controls to accelerate our earnings growth capacity. As I said at the beginning of the call, we do remain confident in our ability to grow earnings in 2002, in the 30 percent range. As we look forward to 2003, we must see acceleration in our sales growth to sustain future earning growth and trends, and this organization is highly focused on finding new ways to grow. We have lots of new ideas, we have a number of new tests, none of them are at a stage where we're ready to talk about them, but we are focused on growing our business, growing market share in North America, continuing our market share growth outside the United States. We are seeing some early signs of small improvements in the domestic economy, somewhat offset by the softness in our European catalog operations. As I said earlier, in the quarter we saw a small up tick in our average order size in our North America retail stores. We saw our technology sales, while declining, to be the lowest level of decline in the last five quarters. We've seen a small improvement in average order size in our North America contract business, and we continue to make improvements in our cost structure in spite of lower sales volumes. In summary, we think we had a great quarter. We still are focused on improvement, we have an organization dedicated to make Office Depot the most compelling place to work, shop and invest, in our sector, and as I said, now almost two years ago, I wouldn't bet against this company in the long term, and I still wouldn't do it. On that basis, I'd like to turn the call over to all of you for any questions you might have about the quarter and the comments I've just made. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Operator And at this time we'll be in the question and answer portion of today's call. If you would like to ask a question, press star, one on your touch-tone phone pad. If you are using speaker equipment, you may need to lift your handset prior to pressing star one. To withdraw your question, press star two. Once again that is star one to ask a question, and star two to withdraw your question. And our first question comes from Bill Julian (ph) of Salomon Smith Barney. Bill Julian - Salomon Smith Barney Thanks. Good morning Bruce. Let me start just by asking for a point of clarification. When you talk about 30 percent earnings growth for 2002 with no improvement in the domestic economy, are you essentially saying you can do that without any sales growth in your North American businesses? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO No. What I'm saying is that I don't -- I think the 30 percent growth comes on with the outlook we have for the second half of the year. And that basically says we believe our North America retail comps, when we finish 2002, will be basically neutral. We had negative 1.7 in the first quarter. We believe that we're anniversarying (ph) some softer retail comps. We believe that technology has somewhat bottomed. We think we'll see an uplift in that in the second quarter. So we're saying if the economy stays the way it is, it doesn't go up much, and it doesn't go down, we're 6 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

APRIL 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q1 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call confident of our ability, given the sales levels we've anticipated in each of our business segments, that we will deliver this year the 30 percent plus growth in our, in our EPS. Should we get an uplift in the economy, we think it's more than that, I'm just not today ready to sit back and say we're ready to tell you that the economies turned itself around. As in the past, I plan on a mid-quarter update towards the end of May, when I'll give all of you more color and insight into our performance in the second quarter. And I'll give you a better feel again, but basically what we're saying Bill (ph) is the economy stays the same, this is the earning capacity of the company, if sales were to begin to accelerate, our earning capacity can accelerate. Bill Julian - Salomon Smith Barney OK, that's fair. You're obviously pushing up against old high-water margins, and pushing beyond them. Can you comment a little bit on how far you think those might go over the next couple of years? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Well I think that on the gross margin side, I think we've got one quarter left, this one, in which the delta between the quarter a year ago and this quarter will be fairly significant. Again, we're anniversarying the SKU rationalization we did in our retail stores, we very basically re-merchandised our entire chain in the second quarter of last year. I said that would lead to higher margins, better mix, a better market basket and it has. We anniversaryed that starting in the third quarter. We also have been more disciplined about our pricing, we've used our data warehouse to be smarter about our pricing, we've focused on our contract account profitability. I think our margin levels beyond the second quarter are sustainable outside of mix changes, either technology mix or some contract mix. I don't look for gross margin expansion after the second quarter compared to previous quarters. The -- any change will be a mix change. And be small changes. Bill Julian - Salomon Smith Barney OK, thank you. Operator And our next question comes from Dan Wewur (ph) of Deutsche Bank Alex Brown. Dan Wewur - Deutsche Bank Alex Brown Good morning. Question on the business service group, at the end of 2001 that division was generating a margin of about 7.9 percent which was always thought to be the high-water mark potential in that business. Clearly with the results you achieved in the first quarter we have to rethink the ultimate profitability in BSG. Now Bruce when you think about the art of the possible, you know, how high is high now in BSG? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO I think that Dan (ph) , that's a good question Dan (ph) . I think that clearly we had a great quarter performance. We're continuing to anniversary improvements that we started to make -- those improvements have accelerated so some of the improvement gets more difficult, second and third quarter, because we've made drastic changes in this company for the positive. I think this business is still, and I've said all along, I think it's an eight to a nine percent business. 7 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

APRIL 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q1 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call You say, well geeze it was 9.9 in the first quarter, well I've said all along, we're going to use some of our efficiencies and some of our leverage in improvements to try and grow our business. We backed a little bit away from the large account segment a year and a half ago, I wasn't comfortable about our ability to do it profitably. I am today. That tends to have a lower gross margin mix with it, and tends to come with it a little operating cross reduction compared to medium and smaller sized accounts. The other point is, there's a point where frankly, I mean you may not want to hear this as a shareholder, but this business can get too profitable, it creates an umbrella, I don't want to invite. But this is still, you know, a plus eight percent business, we've said it all along, I still think it is, I don't think it's a ten percent business. I think if we get it to that point we'll use our buying power which we think we have, our efficiency which we think we've got, and we'll be more aggressive on market share account by account, and do it smartly. But this is a eight percentage, eight percentish operating performance business. Dan Wewur - Deutsche Bank Alex Brown Well just if I follow up, just one question on that. You know in the past you've talked about being rational on pricing for contract accounts. I think they've been how you've talked about, you know, trying to get a 21 or 22 percent margin on that business. Given that you've made so much progress in reducing your cost structure, could you not get more competitive in pricing for the contract accounts, and thereby enhancing your top line? And still, you know, get that eight or nine percent division margin? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Pricing for contract accounts is somewhere between an art and a science. I've been in this business a long time, and you have to look an account by account basis in addition to pricing Dan (ph) you've got to look at the service requirements of the accounts, some accounts you can take lower margins and make money based on their service requirements, some accounts are higher margins. I just think this segment is an opportunity up for us to grow share in. As I said, we over the last year have been reluctant to go at it heavily. We've added some resources to it, it's partly reflected in our G&A costs, as we've added sales resource to this channel. I don't, I don't, I don't mean to portray we're going to get irrational on pricing, because we're not. This is a company driven to get return on assets, return on net assets and profitability. We'll do it wisely, we'll do it smartly, we'll do it account by a time, we'll do it strategically. And this is, this is a segment that we're investing in because we believe we can generate good margins, good roll (ph) up, but to talk about pricing strategy in a broad aspect beyond that isn't appropriate for a call like this. I -- rationality is important to all of us, but where we can, we want to grow our business, and we're focused on growing that business. Dan Wewur - Deutsche Bank Alex Brown Great. Thanks a lot. Good luck. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Thanks. Operator And our next question comes from Erin Rubinson (ph) of UBS Warburg. 8 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

APRIL 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q1 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call Erin Rubinson - UBS Warburg Hey guys, two questions on the sales side. Number one, you talked about, while the comps were down 1.7 percent at retail, you mentioned furniture was down four, technology was down 13, and then at least in the body of the release it says a number of core office supply category comps were positive. What was I guess, north of the minus 1.7 to have pulled it up that much given you've only given us the categories that were low? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Well, I would answer generally are -- first of all, just kind of a parenthetical for a minute, I think we tend to break out more details about our business than any of our competitors by product category. I don't want to go beyond what I've broken out. Furniture and technology are important because they're high-ticket items, they're somewhat indicative of the economy. Needless to say, if you do the math, and I'm now telling technology the way I define it, which is laptops, desktops, monitors, printers, digital cameras, are now 15 percent of our North America retail mix, down from 25 almost a year ago. I say if you do some math on that, you'll find that our, that over half our business is core office supplies, and by definition in totality, you have to be comping up. It doesn't mean every category is comping up because it's not, but the, but we got, but the core of our supply business, our basic supply business is obviously positively comping. It varies by category. As much as all of you would like to know exactly by category, I'm not prepared to talk at it more category than what I already do. It's already, as I said, more than most of our competitors do. Erin Rubinson - UBS Warburg OK. And then on the average ticket and transaction, you mentioned that your ticket was a little bit better. Is that average selling price, or reduction in deflation versus items per transaction, and on the transaction side would you have thought that your transaction count would be up, given your new ad campaign? And then I'm done. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO OK, thanks Erin (ph) . You know, because averages get you in serious trouble when you look across the chain of the number of transactions we have in retail. I don't think we've seen any real price degration in technology. The average items tends to be about the same as it's been. I think it's a very small encouraging sign at this moment, but in the aggregate, our customers when they aggregate up, are buying a little bit more. Two, as it relates to your comment about an ad campaign. We re-launched our brand, what we stand for, we're three months into that re-launch. I don't think that you can measure a brand and advertising in a three-month period of time, as to whether it drives transactions or traffic. Frankly one of the things about some, companies like Office Depot where we have multiple channels, our brand advertising has the impact of far more than just retail. Clearly it helps our e-commerce sales, clearly it helps our small to medium sized account sales. So I think from our perspective we're pleased today with the performance of our ads. It's still early in the process. We've got some new ones coming out for back to school and holiday, but I think branding and advertising is a long-term thing, not a month-to-month, quarter to quarter thing. Somebody once said you waste 50 percent of what you advertise you just don't know where you waste it. That's probably a true statement. But overall I think our advertising campaign is doing what we it to do, three months in to what we plan for it to do both internally and externally. Erin Rubinson - UBS Warburg Thanks Bruce. 9 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

APRIL 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q1 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call Operator And our next question comes from Matthew Fessler (ph) of Goldman Sachs. Matthew Fessler - Goldman Sachs Thanks a lot. Excuse me, good morning. Just a couple of quick questions here. First of all Bruce, to get a little more specific about your earnings potential of BSG, clearly you delivered expenses at a lower level than you've seen at any point in time recently. Is there anything seasonal about the rest of the year that would suggest that the expense ratio would need to be any higher than it was in the first quarter? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO The only seasonal thing is we get into leverage Matt (ph) . We do get our first quarter tends to be, in BSG, one of our higher quarters in absolute sales performance. One of the things that we said, I said, we would do 18 months ago, is we'd prove to all of you that there is such a thing in our warehouse's fixed and variable costs. 18 months ago all of our costs, up to 100 percent variable, revenue went up 20 percent, costs went up 20 percent. We do have a fixed element of our costs in our North American warehouses, and as the absolute sales dollars in a quarter decline, not necessarily in comps, but just in quarter, it gets more difficult to leverage and therefore the expenses as a percentage get different. If you're asking do I think we're going to keep our handle on absolute dollar costs, absolutely I do. And I still think there's improvement left in our North American business. This comes at a time by the way, when we're getting enormous pressure on delivery costs. I mean, delivery costs in the form of the aftermath of September 11th still means that the carriers that deliver packages for us, and our own delivery systems are more expensive and we've gotten this improvement even facing that pressure. So I think its impact is based on leverage, if you will, as quarters vary somewhat in their total revenue. Matthew Fessler - Goldman Sachs Now just to make sure that we understand the direction in which BS, business system moving, you talked about some softness on the West coast, but nonetheless it appears as if your same location growth in this business is a bit better than it was in the fourth quarter. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO It is an improvement over the fourth quarter levels. Matthew Fessler - Goldman Sachs OK, so ... Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO ...financial statement. Matthew Fessler - Goldman Sachs So it's not as if we have to fight the tide of eroding business condition in BSG as we think about the expense ratio? 10 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

APRIL 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q1 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Yeah, I think, this is a business I think that's significantly impacted by the overall domestic economy, and in particular, the outlook of the Fortune 300 accounts, Fortune three or 400 size accounts that either grow and add on people, or they continue to lay people off, and so this is still a business because of the large account segment, that's highly dependent upon a better North American economy, and I don't pretend to be able to understand the economy well enough to be able to give you more insight. I just think we've got some larger accounts that will come into our business now, beginning in the second quarter. These are wins that we got late last year. I think that's going to help our business somewhat. So we've got improving trends in this segment sequentially for each of the next three quarters. We believe the comps if you will, sequentially in the second quarter will be better than the first, third better than the second, and fourth better than the third. Part of that's the anniversarying and part of that's some things we think we're doing. Matthew Fessler - Goldman Sachs Got you ... Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO And that's not anticipating a huge benefit from an improving North America domestic economy. Matthew Fessler - Goldman Sachs Now, say that's what's in the contract business which you've been discussing, it seems like you are refocusing to some degree on the large national accounts. What kind of competitive environment do you find yourself stepping into in that business, and how does it compare with where it's been over the past couple of years? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO I would say it's a very strong competitive environment. We've got three very strong competitors that are good at what they do. I mean this is a scratch, dig and claw business. You've got to earn the business one account at a time, and you've got to do it with a total package that goes beyond price. I think it's a relatively rational marketplace in totality. You clearly get some marquis accounts in this business segment, that irrationally takes place on a marquis account or two. But overall I think the competitive nature of this business is that all of us want to deliver shareholder returns, at least it appears that way in the public stuff they all talk about, and I mean BT, or Corporate Express, excuse me, Boise Cascade and Staples. So I don't, I think it's a more consolidated environment than it was three years ago. Sure there's some people that aren't here, that were here three years ago. It's a tough environment, it's a competitive environment, we've got great competitors. And I think we've got to, I think we can, I think we can grow share in this segment. Matthew Fessler - Goldman Sachs My final question. You find yourself here at the end of the first quarter with an awful lot of cash. If your stock continues to do well, and your convert is not put to you later this year, you're going to find yourself sitting on more than you might have expected just a few months ago. You know, what is your plan for deploying that cash, it's certainly more you can deploy in the existing business, there's not a lot of, there's not a lot of bank debt to take out here, so are you thinking about buying back additional stock -- what would your deployment look like? 11 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

APRIL 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q1 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Well first of all I want you to know this is a very high quality problem. Matthew Fessler - Goldman Sachs Fair enough. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Somewhat different than I faced 18 months ago, had some other problems that weren't high quality ones. This one is a high quality one. Two is, it's not a long history yet, it's a couple of quarters. There is, without getting specific, I do think there are opportunities to grow this business both domestically and outside the United States that may require some use of our cash. Fourth, I am, and we are committed as a company to improve our credit ratings. I've said that 18 months ago, we have continuous dialog with the credit rating agencies. I want them to look at Office Depot and I want them to say these, this company has earned a higher credit rating. That takes a pristine balance sheet, cash. As it relates to the long-term thing, what you do with cash, the reality is as I've said before, this executive group of managers is committed to growing shareholder value. Period. If you want to see how that works, take a look at our proxy where we think we have aligned the interests of shareholders very much with the interests and the motivation of our leadership. And we will use that cash in one way or another, over a period of time, to drive shareholder value. Period. Matthew Fessler - Goldman Sachs Thank you very much. Thanks a lot. Operator And our next question comes from Colin McLanahan (ph) of Sanford Bernstein. Colin McLanahan - Sanford Bernstein Hey Bruce, was hoping you could give us maybe a little bit more color on Europe. What's the situation kind of look like on the ground there, any sense of when you think comps might improve? And then longer term, you know, kind of the BSD question as well, you knew you'd talked about that being a 13 to 15 percent operating margin business. Is there any change in the pace of investment you're planning that would impact that outlook? And then again, longer term any change in thinking the pace of the growth for Europe? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO OK, several questions. The first one is, when do I think comps are going to improve in North America retail. Colin (ph) I've been working at this for 18 months and haven't got it right yet. Colin McLanahan - Sanford Bernstein Bruce, international, not in A.R. 12 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

APRIL 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q1 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO International? Well, you know, first of all this softening that took place in the first quarter is really the first signs of some softening across the continent in Europe. And it's across most the countries so I know it's not operational, I know it's not executional. Our own view at the moment is that's at least for the next two quarters that we'll see that softness in our catalog business. As I, as we commented in our release, I think we can mitigate some of that softness through our growing BSD business. From our own perspective that softness is likely to put a two to three, two to three cent pressure on our own numbers about profitability to give you the magnitude of it. We think we can make some of -- by that, that includes the continued currency issues that we have. If you'd have said to me I thought we'd have a euro of 88 or 86 cents right now I'd have said no way. Colin McLanahan - Sanford Bernstein Didn't think so either. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Yeah, so, I don't like -- that continues to impact the translation results. So I think some softness, at least for the next two quarters in our own forecast throughout Europe and the rest of the world in the Viking catalog model. This had offset by the growing BSD presence. To your question about invest in the long-term, this is still a 13 plus percent return on investment, or return on sales business over time. We continue Colin (ph) to look for ways to grow in Europe. I've said all along it's a market that's larger than the U.S., it's more fragmented. I believe there are opportunities to accelerate growth in Europe, either by accelerating the entry of new countries, and/or looking at opportunities to maybe acquire in certain segments. Retail is not our primary strategy in Europe. We do have a retail strategy in France, that we're delighted and excited about. We're investing in it. So I think, I think we have a lever called how much do we want to spend how fast. We do have a commitment to grow shareholder value, we have to blend that always. And so we'll accelerate sometimes, we'll slow down sometimes, particularly our entry into new countries. I mean at one point we had plans to enter another new country late this year. We've moved that off a little bit, probably more until next year, as a result of the softness we've seen, plus our desire to continue to generate consistently improving results. This is a business we're proud of, it's a business we make a lot of money in, it's a high return on net asset business, it too has very positive cash flow. Our building cash balances are not only domestically, they're internationally. This is a good business segment, we think we know how to manage it and lead it. We'll grow our share in it over a period of time. It still represents a unique opportunity for Office Depot and frankly, differentiates us in terms of growth from our two primary superstore competitors in North America. Colin McLanahan - Sanford Bernstein Thanks Bruce. Operator And our next question comes from Gary Bolter (ph) of Credit Suisse First Boston. 13 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

APRIL 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q1 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call Brian Nagle - Credit Suisse First Boston Hi this is Brian Nagle (ph) for Gary Bolter (ph) . I just have a couple of quick basic questions. First off, your tax rate in the quarter was 35 percent versus 37 percent a year ago. Should we be using that rate going forward now? And what's the reason for the decline? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO The answer is, as Charlie Brown, my CFO just nodded yes. That is the neighborhood of the tax rate that you ought to use going forward. I'll let him comment as to why that is. Charles Brown - Office Depot, Inc. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer It's really the benefit from our international tax planning. And as our international income becomes a bigger part of our total income, that allows us to move our tax rate down, so this rate of 35 percent should be used for the year. Brian Nagle - Credit Suisse First Boston So is that 35 ... Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO I do, I might add by the way, that with the dramatic improvement in our stock price, we're getting a little more dilution that we planned in our calculation of shares outstanding. If you remember right, this is a company 18 months ago that had 85 percent of its options under water. As the stock has grown more rapidly than frankly most of us anticipated, we hoped for it but didn't anticipate it. We do have some offsetting dilution in EPS calculations as we've got more shares coming into the base as a result of, as the result of improving stock price. We do have to remind all of you an authorized $50 million buyback on our stock and we're at the end of the first quarter, about 20 some million into that buyback. We continue to buy that back incrementally, it's meant to offset dilution, we frankly have dilution in shares coming at a faster rate than our buying back stock, again it's another high quality problem. Brian Nagle - Credit Suisse First Boston So Charlie, you guys were planning for the 35 percent tax rate at the beginning of the quarter? Charles Brown - Office Depot, Inc. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes. Brian Nagle - Credit Suisse First Boston OK. 14 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

APRIL 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q1 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO In that neighborhood. I mean, appreciate you can't get a tax rate down to a basis point, but we were planning in the neighborhood of 35, 36. I mean you get done at the end of a quarter, that's a, I don't think you can be so finite to say it was 35. Were we planning for a slightly lower tax rate? Yes. Eileen Dunn - Office Depot, Inc. - Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations Brian (ph) it's Eileen. I think most analysts have 35 percent in their models now. Brian Nagle - Credit Suisse First Boston OK, great. Thanks. And the other question is, could someone comment on this, but could you talk about the trend of retail comps as the quarter progressed? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO The tend as the quarter progressed ... Brian Nagle - Credit Suisse First Boston The trend. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Yeah. Brian Nagle - Credit Suisse First Boston The trend in retail comps. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Yeah, if you look at January, February, March, progressive improvement. So each month was a little better than the previous month. So March was the best comp trend in the first quarter. Meaning less negative than the quarter in total. January was the worst comps in comparison. So improving trend. Brian Nagle - Credit Suisse First Boston Great. OK, thanks a lot. Operator And our next question comes from Danielle Fox (ph) of J.P. Morgan. 15 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

APRIL 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q1 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call Danielle Fox - J.P. Morgan Thank you, good morning. Could you comment on the 2Q outlook for EPS, and just your general expectations for comps by segment? You mentioned easier comparisons and I'm wondering when this year you expect the two-year comp trend to turn? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Yeah Danielle (ph) I think that, I'm not -- the thing, all of you as analysts have done your best job to take a look at the second quarter. The consensus of the quarter right now sits at 20 cents. I don't have any change from that direction to give you. I will, as I said earlier, we will, as I said earlier, towards the end of May give all of you our traditional mid-quarter update. At that time, I'll give you insight into comps across business segment, I'll give you insight into earnings trends for the quarter, I'll get more precise if I can on EPS for the second quarter, but I'm going to save those comments until the end of May. But needless to say, remaining comfortable with 30 percent growth targets for 2002 by definition I'm comfortable with the growth targets for the second quarter. Danielle Fox - J.P. Morgan OK, and just a kind of broader question about the full year, about you know, just the two year comp trend given the easing comparisons when we'll actually see an improvement in the, in the two year comp trend for the total company or any of the individual segments? Obviously international is a little bit weaker. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Well, yeah, I think what we sell, you have to do by business segment. Danielle Fox - J.P. Morgan Yeah. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO The second quarter retail will be better comps than the first. The third quarter could be about the same, maybe a little worse than comps than the second. We got a back to school anniversary we did extremely well on. That directionally is the same. We think our fourth quarter retail will be our best comps in quite some time, and they'll be positive. And that gets you to basically neutral for the year. We said earlier our BSG comps we anticipate quarter by quarter improvement in the BSG business. International, we in spite of the softness, we do anticipate better comps in the second quarter. That's got to do with mailing plans, holidays in Europe and a variety of other things, and a growing BSD business and the growing impact of our two new countries, Switzerland and Spain. And we think those comps continue to improve throughout the year, and when you get done with the year we think on comp basis for the year, we'll be in the neighborhood of, hold on a sec here. For year comp for the company. Yeah, a couple points -- well let me -- Danielle (ph) we'll get back to you off line on that. Danielle Fox - J.P. Morgan That'd be great. 16 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

APRIL 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q1 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO That segment and I don't, I haven't looked at how that rolls up yet. Eileen Dunn - Office Depot, Inc. - Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations Rolls up to a total sales growth for the year of around mid-single digits. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO A total sales growth mid-single digits for the company for the year. Danielle Fox - J.P. Morgan OK, great. Thanks very much. Operator And our next question comes from Jack Belos (ph) of Midwood (ph) Research. Jack Belos - Midwood Research Hi. Regarding the office supply business, just that category in total. What's been the trend in sales in that category this quarter and the past few quarters? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Well I think as our, as our negative comps have declined in North America retail, since we completed the re-merch and the SKU and the rationalization we completed in the second quarter in North America last year, we said that that would drive better comps and better margins, and our supply categories have positively improved sequentially third quarter, fourth quarter, first quarter. So we continue to see directionally signs of that business improving. I think that's a couple of things. I think one is that when we did re-merchandise our stores, we got adjacent fees better than we ever had them before. And that's when a customer buys a low margin item like a one inch black binder, they often buy some indexes or other labels to go with it that tend to be higher margin items, and that drives comps. Second of all, we've been focused on driving comps in our core business, and so improving trends sequentially to answer your question. Jack Belos - Midwood Research Would you quantify that in terms of being low single-digit improvement in this quarter? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO No, I won't Jack (ph) only because I said, I said earlier, we quantify far more than our competitors. Directionally our supply sales are positive, they're not positive in every category -- I'm not trying to hide, it's just directionally I'm trying to give you direction. As I said, I don't want to get into the point where we're talking about comp trends by category. 17 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

APRIL 17, 2002 / 12:00PM, ODP.OQ - Q1 2002 Office Depot Earnings Conference Call I talk about furniture and technology because they're such high-ticket items, they have such a big impact on the company, they've had a negative impact far greater than anything else on comps. I'll continue to talk about those in the future, and lump the rest of our product sales in our retail into a large basic category called basic office supplies. Jack Belos - Midwood Research Regarding the roll out of the payroll scheduling. How many stores did you say that's in currently, and when do you expect to have the entire chain that way? Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO It's 100 plus stores, and we'll have the entire roll out done by late May, early June. Jack Belos - Midwood Research Oh, OK. Thank you very much. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO You're welcome. Operator And at this time I would like turn the conference over to Miss Eileen Dunn and Mr. Bruce Nelson for closing comments. Bruce Nelson - Office Depot, Inc. - Chairman and CEO Thanks for taking your valuable time to listen to our results for the first quarter. As I said, I think I'm encouraged by all the progress the company's made over the past 18 months. I think you can see it in consistency, I think you can see it in quality, I think you can see it in our results. We're still faced with some uncertainty in a domestic economy, some softness in the European economy, in spite of that we continue to do well. Our ability to accelerate earnings growth beyond the 30 percent is, as many of you pointed out, dependent on increasing growth here in North America. We see some signs of it, hopefully that will continue. We will give you more insight to that at the, towards the end of May. In the meantime, this is a management team committed to making Office Depot the most compelling place to work, shop and invest. We think we've done an admirable job of improving our metrics. We continue to focus on the things that drive shareholder value. That's what it's about. Thanks for listening and thanks for your support. Operator Thank you for attending Office Depot's first quarter 2002 earnings conference call, and have a good day. 18 THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us ©2020 Thomson Reuters.

TRANSCRIPT Operator Good afternoon and welcome to Noranda Incorporated First Quarter 2002 Earnings Results Conference Call. During the presentation all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question and answer session. At that time, if you have a question, please press the one, followed by the four on your telephone. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday April 24, 2002. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kerr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir. DAVID KERR Thank you very much, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to everyone. Joining me in Noranda boardroom today are Derek Pannell, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Aaron Regent, our Chief Financial Officer. There are also some other operating people in the room who will be available for questions and discussions as they go in that direction. As you may have read, Noranda reported earnings for the first quarter of $1 million, which is a loss of 2 cents per share, after taking into account-preferred dividend. And, while this is far from ideal, I would like to point to the turnaround that this represents when you look at the cash operating margin, which has increased despite lower metal prices. We've been able to record an increase an increase in cash operating margin because we have increased production across virtually all of our business. When compared to the first quarter of 2001, an impressive 73 percent increase in mined copper, 22 percent in mined zinc, and 8 percent in mined nickel. These were, in turn, as a result of the intensive capital investment of the program we've had over the past five years and are now making an impact on our bottom-line Also impacting our bottom line has been improved performance in American Racing Equipment and Aaron will just discuss the other new strategy is making this difference. We also raised $400 million cash in the past quarter, just past the end of this quarter when it will close through the sale of 45 percent of the Noranda Income Fund, which owes all of the CEZinc refinery. And, the refinery, as you know, has been a consistently outstanding performer. This allows us to raise a sizable amount of capital to enhance our financial flexibility while still maintaining an interest in an add-operative facility. We've been active in getting Falcon Bridge and Noranda to work more closely together on areas that make sense, such as with our copper operation and in certain corporate functions. It has been a period of intense activity at Noranda, and these efforts, combined with our improved asset base, have put in Noranda in an excellent position to benefit from an improvement in metal prices and the economy. On that note, I will ask Aaron if he would take us through the financial picture that he has. AARON REGENT Great. Thank you, David. If I could speak first of the net earnings slide, which is part of the presentation that has been distributed, the cash operative margin, as David highlighted was 252 million in the quarter compared to $199 million last year. Later in the presentation, I'll walk through a breakdown of the various components of the cash operating margin. Below that line, depreciation and amortization expense increased from where we were last year really reflects an increase in the production base of the company the corresponding higher depreciation charges that goes with it. Our other expenses increased from last year as well, many as a result of higher interest expense as we stopped capitalizing interest against a number of our projects, and, also -- which was somewhat offset by a lower interest rate. Overall, our earnings for the quarter were $1 million, compared to $24 million last year. If I could turn to the next slide, this next slide highlights the main variances between this quarter versus last year. You'll see that metal prices, on a comparable bases were lower than last year and reduced earnings by $32 million. This was offset by -- partially offset by increased volumes, particularly from the contributions from Antamina, Lomas Bayas, offset somewhat by the Falcondo operations, which were partially idled during the quarter. Foreign exchange was positive compared to last year. And, the other line, which are costs, was really higher interest expense compared to last year. The first quarter of last year there were also some unusual items we, in the first quarter this year, we really didn't have any notable unusual items. Last year, we just want to remind people that there was a U.S. tax recovery of approximately $39 million, which positively impacted our results in the first quarter of last year. 2 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

APRIL 24, 2002 / 8:00PM, FAL_pa.TO^G08 - Q1 2002 NORANDA INC Earnings Conference Call Similarly, the strike at Sudbury operations negatively impacted our results on a comparable basis, that cost the company about $30 million. Metal prices, compared this quarter versus last year, we're down significantly across the board. I think zinc was down 22 percent, copper down 12 percent, nickel down 5 percent and aluminum down 12 percent. So, you can see the impact that that has had on our results. If I could now turn to the slide which is headed the cash operating margin, I'll walk through the various components of these. Overall, our cash operating margins were 27 percent higher than last year. Turning first to the copper group, this includes the, essentially, the South American operations of the company, the Antamina mine, the Collahausi mine, Lomas Bayas mine and the Altonorte smelter. We look at the copper group; copper sales volumes and operating margins increased significantly, primarily as a result of the contributions from Antamina and Lomas Bayas. If I could turn to Antamina first to make a few comments, Antamina contributed 29 million to our cash operating margins, or $13 million to our earnings in the quarter. The contribution from Antamina was positive, but lower than we had anticipated for a few explainable reasons. First, the copper zinc production was below what we anticipated with the lower head grades and recoveries. Really a result of the discrepancy in the mining of different benches than planned, as well as the mining of additional but economic lower grade ore that was incognita from undrilled areas, which was previously assumed to be waste. Cash operating costs were 41 cents per pound, also a bit higher than what we had anticipated, because of, principally, because of lower byproducts revenues, really lower zinc revenues from lower zinc production and lower zinc prices were the main reasons. Collahausi contributed $32 million to earnings, which was slightly below last year despite a significant reduction in copper prices. This was due to a strong performance of the mine, both on a production side, as well as lowering unit cost, which helped to mitigate a lower realized copper price. Lomas Bayas also contributed quite positively to our first quarter results. A cash operating margin of 15 million, the earnings contribution was $9 million, what exceeded what our expectations were. Net operating cash costs of 46 cents per pound, which is very competitive with many other mines of the world. Altonorte experienced a formally known negative operating margin, which is -- always coming out positive, but it was better than last year. The operating margin reflected lower volumes but were partially offset by lower site costs. Our production targets were slow what we anticipated due to the delay in the start-up in the reactor and associated equipment related to the phase 3A expansion of Altonorte. This equipment began operating on March 13 versus our original plan of January 1, but I can see that that reactor start-up is proceeding well and it's expected to reach plan operating parameters in the second quarter. I'd like to turn to our zinc group. Zinc group had a loss of $9 million in the quarter, compared to earnings of $3 million last year. This is quite a significant achievement, particularly when you look at the fact that zinc prices declined by 22 percent over the comparable period and the zinc group were able to partially offset the substantial reduction in the zinc price by lowering the unit cost by almost 7 cents per pound compared to last year. Our primary aluminum operations margin were below last year, due primarily to lower aluminum prices, which was also partially offset by lower until costs. Indiscernible) volumes continuing to increase with the ramp-up of a single-piece anode project. We expect for this to continue throughout the balance of the year. In our aluminum foil our foil results were below last year. Shipments of foil were 8 percent higher than last year, but below what we had anticipated due the continued softness in the foil market. Fabrication spreads also declined due to a lighter gage product mix and also a softer market for value-added products. Turning to our nickel operation, nickel operating margins were $26 million compared to $1 million last year. Nickel sales volumes from I&O were significantly higher than last year. Last year, you will recall was affected by the strike in Sudbury. The ferronickel product was lower this year as a result of the shutdown of Falcondo. Falcondo has restarted operating in February and was in full operating in March. Our Canadian copper recycling business, this next slide highlights really the Canadian operations with the exception of Kidd. I have a separate slide on Kidd. When we look at our results our operating margins were essentially comparable to last year. Production levels were on or ahead of plan. Results continue to reflect the mix of feed materials, and generally lower realized margins due to a decline in recycle fees. However, we were able to partially offset this by the treatment of higher complex materials, which also has higher margins. The first part of the results were also positively impacted by our higher capital sales volumes and better copper prices. Kidd Creek, Kidd had an operating loss of $21 million in the quarter, compared to a loss of $1 million last year. Mine operations performed better than anticipated. However, the results were negatively impacted primarily as a result of lower metal prices compared to last year. Looking at American Racing, our first quarter results from a cash operating perspective were breakeven compared to a loss of $10 million last year. OEM sales volumes continued to decline while aftermarket sales are seeing steadily increasing. The major reason for the improved performance was a reduction 3 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

APRIL 24, 2002 / 8:00PM, FAL_pa.TO^G08 - Q1 2002 NORANDA INC Earnings Conference Call in costs, which resulted from a number initiatives, which we have communicated to you before. In particular, the closure of the Warsaw facility, significant staff reductions and overhead reductions. Also, energy costs were lower this year compared to last year, at the first quarter last we did have a number of disruptions due the energy situation in California. If I could turn to our consolidated statement of cash flow, make a few comments there; our cash flow before working capital changes was significantly higher than last year, $209 million compared to $118 million. That's all due positive on the part of the negative side, our working capital, also increased significantly by approximately $168 million. Particularly relates to a number of different things, first Falcondo restarting operations so there's natural buildup of working capital. Second, with higher metal prices, particularly in nickel, it also increases the value of working capital. As Antamina continues to ramp up there's a buildup of working capital on that business. And, as well, in general, there is some seasonal buildup of inventories and working capital as we go into the December season for a certain of our businesses. Our capital investments, capital is $189 million in the quarter, which is significantly below last year's number of $313 million. Of that $189 million approximately 60 million related to maintenance and the balance through capital projects. Projects such as the Altonorte expansion, the Kidd mine and so on. A brief comment on our balance sheet, our debt levels increased in the quarter and our debt to capitalization ratio is now approximately 45 percent. With the proceeds we'll receive from the Noranda Income Fund of approximately $400 million, we'll receive on closing, which is scheduled for May 3. This will help us to meet our objective of not increasing our debt level in 2002 from our 2001 levels. Hopefully, we can exceed that objective and see a decline in our overall level of debt. That concludes my comments at this point. DEREK PANNELL This is Derek Pannell, I'd just like to add one or two detailed remarks, perhaps on the operations to elaborate on the points that Aaron has made. On the aluminum side, operating results here generally improving. On the quantum leap project, continual ramp there. We're starting to see sales beginning to pick up on -- that's on our aluminum foil area. And, also, American Racing the strategy to emphasize the aftermarket rather than the OEM side of the business is progressing well and, in fact, is giving us the improving results that Aaron mentioned there. On Antamina, we're presenting in the completion test phase that will take some time. It's over the 90 days, but that is underway at the present time. Last month we produced the first magnolia concentrate at Antamina. And, one thing that I think that's worth noting and it was a concern to some people outside. And, that was the ease of transfer between the different ore types Antamina being our other 50 complex ore body. Switching between ore types and getting them down the pipeline. In fact, our experience to date has been that these transfers between ore types can be accomplished quite efficiently. And, that's very good news there and gives us a fair amount of flexibility. At Altonorte, as Aaron said, we did start up the reactor. The startup was late by about a month and a half. We also started up the slag mill. We ran it first on slag that produced from the rebook furnace. It's now running well on slag produced from the reactor. The reactor is running well. With the existing acid bump we're getting good sulfa fixations, well over the 90 percent, and the remaining part of the project, the acid plant and the oxygen plant that are due to be completed in 2003, we certainly appear to be on time and on budget for the remainder of that expansion. In Collahausi, again, as Aaron said, good results there. And, we're moving from the Ohenato the Rosereo Pitwe will be and have led the first two contracts for the major equipment in order to accomplish that transfer. That's the crusher and the overland conveyer, which will allow us to operate the Rosereo Pit and that's still into the original mill. At Gaspe we also announced the permanent shutdown of the Gaspe operation, that's happening this week, at the end of April. And have already begun to divert concentrates -- the concentrates contracts that we are maintaining, they have already been diverted to the Horne or elsewhere. The magnesium Danville the ramp up continues very steadily there as we have replanned we're up about 20 cells. And, we're now; I think at a level an operating level that is quite substantial. So, that enables us in terms of gas velocity through ducts operating ease at a level, an operating level that makes it somewhat easier to troubleshoot some of the problems that we might have in the future. So, again, things at the Magnesium plant are ramping up quite well. 4 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

APRIL 24, 2002 / 8:00PM, FAL_pa.TO^G08 - Q1 2002 NORANDA INC Earnings Conference Call On the nickel side I think everybody has, perhaps, seen the release that we had on the results at Nickel Rim, I think were very positive, spectacular even. The Raglan mine continues to operate very well. We're at a million tons there. And, we have contract negotiations underway. We're not at the stage where we have a recommendation from the union to the members to accept a contract there. So, that is looking quite positive. And, that contract expires at the end of this month. But, every sign is that we should get acceptance by the members over the next three weeks of a renegotiated contract. As Aaron mentioned, also, we hit a shutdown of Falcondo operation in Dominican Republic for approximately three months. That started up during the quarter and during March was operating at full capacity. The startup went very well. Finally, on the integration of Noranda and Falconbridge, that has moving at pace. We have the structure decided upon and communicated to employees that we will be using in the Toronto office, particularly for the back office corporate support functions, and, also in the Santiago offices as we bring the two companies together. And, so that part of it is certainly moving well and also we're starting to see some other areas for collaboration between the two companies and one of those examples would be the acid that is produced by Altonorte and consumed by Lomas Bayas. Again, quite a substantial savings can be made there. I think that summarizes the comments that I have on the operations. DAVID KERR OK. And, I think that (indiscernible) comments. Operator, you said to get back to you when we were ready to take questions, and we are. THE OPERATION Caller Aaron, for a change we didn't have any unusual items in the quarter. That makes it clean. The second quarter, I note that the CEZinc deal is down, what would the number that you're going to reporting on the book for your adjustment as a usual item or if any? AARON REGENT From an earnings perspective, Terry? Caller Correct, from PLO'spoint of view. AARON REGENT One of the things we need to sort out is what the working capital balance is going to be. But, I think in the press release we highlighted in the neighborhood of $50 million of net, net gain, that's after taxes and provisions. Caller Okay, so the (indiscernible) is still to be working capital is still to be adjusted between the assets, right, between the entities? 5 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

APRIL 24, 2002 / 8:00PM, FAL_pa.TO^G08 - Q1 2002 NORANDA INC Earnings Conference Call AARON REGENT Yes, we've got a pretty idea of what it's going to be. We just need to sharpen the pencils to put a pen in it. But, in terms of earnings, the anticipated gain in the order of 50 million. And, that's after transaction costs, taxes, things like that. Caller Derek, could you please talk about the upcoming production in the quarter in terms of concentrate grades and the head grades and your outlook for the second quarter and also for the year, what the number is going to be EPF? What about antidotal evidence from different sources here, what are the numbers going to be in terms of concentrate and the concentrate grades? What were the numbers in the first quarter too? DEREK PANNELL Well, I'm not sure I've got the numbers in the first quarter. Just to talk, perhaps, first a little generally about Antamina. What has happened, in the mine, the open pit, it's quite -- still quite tight in there with the number of benches is quite limited. And, that's normal at the beginning of a mine, particularly with the topography that is present there. And, with the additional ore that was found, it was assumed before it was being waste, there was just much higher in zinc then it left us relatively little options other than to do what we did. So, that's the main reason behind that. I don't have the details for the prediction, but we're looking during the first quarter the average grade was 1.3 percent copper, 1.4 percent zinc, which is about 20 percent lower than what we had planned. And, I don't have the detailed tonnages that are expected for the rest of the year. There's no reason to expect that they would be for the remaining three quarters any different than what we had previously predicted. Caller So, you're not changing your forecast for the year, whatever they were, despite the first quarter of the grade adjustment? DEREK PANNELL No, I think we won't probably catch up on the first quarter, but the remaining three quarters would remain the same as predicted. Operator Caller Regarding Brasscanwhat is there current ownership of Noranda and is there any reason to expect that this will either shrink or grow and which? AARON REGENT Brasscan owns approximately 40 percent of Noranda right now and they have stated that they intend to continuing owning the shares of Brasscan. Caller Status quo, then? 6 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

APRIL 24, 2002 / 8:00PM, FAL_pa.TO^G08 - Q1 2002 NORANDA INC Earnings Conference Call AARON REGENT Owning their shares of Noranda, let's correct that one. Yes, that is our understanding. And, we've actually gone up and spoken with the CEO of Brasscan just on that subject just so that we'd be able to answer this question as we're doing right now. And, he said we intend to keep on owning of Noranda. Caller And, he didn't say we're going to buy as much as we can get, then? AARON REGENT He did not comment further. Operator Caller First, you made the comment regarding lower recycling feed through the period. I wonder if you could add some color to your outlook and expectations as to what sort of recycling feed volumes you hope to put through over the next few years, particularly in light of the joint venture. And, secondly, how much interest was capitalized during this quarter? DAVID KERR The recycle the recycle volumes, at the present time we don't have concrete plans for any changes as a result of the coming together of Falconbridge and Noranda, say the two smelters. And, what I have said is that I believe there are a lot of opportunities for that. What we are seeing is the startup of the Hewlett Packard Plant in Nashville, Tennessee and we'll get the plant improvements through that. And, again, the continuing exactly the same, I think, from Rhode Island Micro-metallic in San Jose and the Sacramento Plant. But, on the recycle side, again, once thing that has affected us has been the issue that we've had with Beryllium and that has restricted the amount of feed we've been particularly careful on that. But, that is a problem that we're working on with our suppliers. And, I would expect that feed to increase again. Caller Has the beryllium source feed been coming from a specific source and is the Hewlett Packard joint venture likely to exacerbate that? DAVID KERR No, the Hewlett Packard joint venture is generally has been -- in fact, as far as I know, has been completely free, although, we have checked it. The areas -- we do know it's certain shippers. It's not just one. It's several shippers. It depends on the different feeds that they ship. But, as we become educated about this issue, they too are becoming educated and understand what sorts of feeds are likely to contain levels of beryllium that we cannot accept. So, the market, as well as ourselves, are becoming much more aware of this issue. I think industry in general is becoming more aware of it. 7 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

APRIL 24, 2002 / 8:00PM, FAL_pa.TO^G08 - Q1 2002 NORANDA INC Earnings Conference Call AARON REGENT The amount of capitalized interest in the quarter was approximately $11 million. Operator Caller That does pretty lean, I'm surprised, but in any case, actually, I don't know how wants to tackle this question, but using the 15 percent, parameter, we get these questions a lot by the way, help me out, what price would you use for Noranda to get that 15 percent number for metal. AARON REGENT Is this your return on equity number, Terry? Caller Yes. Just give me a combination number that you guys are using internally for instance that you can achieve that 15 percent number given the asset base, the expanding asset base you have to make. AARON REGENT The 15 percent ROE is a target number for us. We would not say that with the current asset mix and base we have today that we could at long-term trend prices produce a 15 percent rate of return on equity over time. We still have pieces of the puzzle, which we need to fill in to get to that level. However, I will say, Terry, that with the asset base we have today, we're probably capable of long-term trend prices of more than doubling their returns on equity we've had over the past 10 or 15 years. Caller One of the dilemma's that I have, David and Aaron, is that, I mean that this is going back to the -- showing my age here, going back to the 70s, looking at the Noranda balance sheet begin because it has delivered and there's not question about that, you agree with that. And, now we are, you know, now paying approximate net interest cost of about $150 million, and that's almost like, you know, it's about 80 percent or 60 percent of your operating margins. So, that itself is a result of REO on the table. And I'm sure you're addressing it. I'm just wondering what else you're addressing on beyond the prices in terms of balance sheet issues? AARON REGENT We can't ignore prices if you're going to use it as a percentage of margin you're talking about there, because what you're doing is looking at margins that have metal prices that are inflation adjusted terms the lowest they've been in about 60 years. So, that's not really going to help us much with answering your questions. Caller Okay, but the low-term target of Noranda of a balance sheet target of about 20 to 25 percent hasn't changed, that you guys traditionally promoted as the long-term target for Noranda for--. 8 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

APRIL 24, 2002 / 8:00PM, FAL_pa.TO^G08 - Q1 2002 NORANDA INC Earnings Conference Call DAVID KERR We would still like to have debt somewhere between 25 and 35 percent of our total capitalization, yes, that's correct. And, there are times when we are above that and time when we are below and in both cases, we need to take appropriate action to the get back to the more modest levels, or the median levels I should say. AARON REGENT Terry, I also had a comment about our debt in the way we manage our liquidity. We've always had a policy to have a significant undrawn bank lines to support the ebbs and flows of the cash flows of the company. And we continue to do that. And have those available. Second, if you break down our debt, well over or close to half of it would be, really project debt or debt of Falconbridge. So, on a corporate level, our debt levels, I think it's important to sort of isolate or understand that that difference as well. Caller No question Falconbridge carries a lot of debt into the consolidation, no question about it. Okay, thanks Aaron, thanks, David. AARON REGENT Just a last comment, it is obviously above the thresholds that we are very cognizant and have as an objective a desire to reduce that significantly. Caller But, I mean, the question really is, do you want to use metal prices as your leverage to reduce that or do you want to do more asset oriented balance sheet deals, thereby can reduce it, or both? AARON REGENT I think we have to look at, look, I'm the finance guy, so it's my job to look at all those things. Operator Caller Derek, could you talk a little bit more about Magnolia production forecast for this year, and whether or not any of the planned production has been spoken for or sold, thank you? DEREK PANNELL We have Bob Sipplein the room here whose Senior Vice President for Magnesium; perhaps Bob can give you a fuller picture on Magnolia. Bob? BOB SIPPLE The production plan for this calendar year is 30,000 tons of products and at this time, roughly about 70 percent of that is firmly contracted. And, as we ramp up production during the year, the remaining tonnage will be sold on a spot basis. But, so far this year, we've had no difficulty in placing 9 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

We have excellent relationships formed with dye casters in the aluminum industry to place the tons. So, we're still pretty much on plan for the 30,000 tons for this year. Operator Caller Most of my questions have been answered, but one final one, Derek, as you look around the various divisions Noranda on a scale of say one to 10, how would you rate your level of satisfaction with the performance of these divisions? DEREK PANNELL Well, one's never satisfied, so I think this will -- I see a lot of very good people, but I see a lot of room for improvement and I see a lot of opportunities for growth. On a scale of one to five, I'm reluctant to put them on a scale. I think this whole variation. And, I think there are some very positive plants since I've come onboard, we've shut two of the plants down, so I put them on a scale of zero right now and I think the Kentucky Will Plant and the Gaspe smelter I think there are some that are really excellent, Lomas Bayas, which has done -- exceeded far beyond our expectations I would rate it 10, let's say five and that gives us a lot of scope for work. Caller And, you would say that was the same, what, across the divisions, or--? DEREK PANNELL No, I would say it was very varied across divisions and across assets. Operator Caller Just when you mentioned on magnolia that you're selling some of your magnesium spot, I mean, what type of pricing would you be realizing for spot magnesium in the markets, or are you still selling it, although you're selling it into the spot market, are you still selling at a significant premium? And, maybe, sort of when we're on the same topic, could you maybe just refresh my memory if you've capitalized anymore costs at magnolia what the current capitalized cost of that project is? BOB SIPPLE The terms of the prices that we're realizing within the magnesium industry, we tend now to disclose the prices because there's not a LME reference price, so it's very much a negotiate feature between the supplier and the consumer. But, a lot of this spot tonnage, the small amount that we haven't firmly contracted. We would certainly look to place it just with additional business with existing customers as they tend not to be fully contracted for their own requirements to leave some for spot. So, it would go, really, just with increased sales with our strategic accounts as the first choice and if necessary just sold spot to other customers during the course of the year. 10 REFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us ©2020 Refinitiv.

APRIL 24, 2002 / 8:00PM, FAL_pa.TO^G08 - Q1 2002 NORANDA INC Earnings Conference Call Operator Caller I'd like to just -- you missed the second half of David Charles's question, what's the current capitalized cost at magnolia? AARON REGENT I'm sorry; I was about to answer that. On a 100 percent basis the project cost is probably just in excess of a billion dollars, which 80 percent is Noranda's.
